INSERT INTO `api_definition` VALUES (1,1,'ellipsis','Ellipsis\n\nEl-lip’-sis. This is the Greek word ἔλλειψις, a leaving in, from ἐν (en)\nin, and λείπειν (leipein) to leave.\n\nThe figure is so called, because some gap is left in the sentence,\nwhich means that a word or words are left out or omitted. The English\nname of the figure would therefore be Omission.\n\nThe figure is a peculiar form given to a passage when a word or\nwords are omitted; words which are necessary for the grammar, but\nare not necessary for the sense.\n\nThe laws of geometry declare that there must be at least three\nstraight lines to enclose a space. So the laws of syntax declare that\nthere must be at least three words to make complete sense, or the\nsimplest complete sentence. These three words are variously named\nby grammarians. In the sentence “Thy word is truth,” “Thy word” is the\nsubject spoken of, “truth” is what is said of it (the predicate), and the\nverb “is” (the copula) connects it.\n\nBut any of these three may be dispensed with; and this law of\nsyntax may be legitimately broken by Ellipsis.\n\nThe omission arises not from want of thought, or lack of care, or\nfrom accident, but from design, in order that we may not stop to think\nof, or lay stress on, the word omitted, but may dwell on the other\nwords which are thus emphasised by the omission. For instance, in\nMat. 14:19, we read that the Lord Jesus “gave the loaves to His\ndisciples, and the disciples to the multitude.”\n\nThere is no sense in the latter sentence, which is incomplete, “the\ndisciples to the multitude,” because there is no verb. The verb “gave”\nis omitted by the figure of Ellipsis for some purpose. If we read the last\nsentence as it stands, it reads as though Jesus gave the disciples to\nthe multitude!\n\nThis at once serves to arrest our attention; it causes us to note the\nfigure employed; we observe the emphasis; we learn the intended\nlesson. What is it? Why, this; we are asked to dwell on the fact that the\ndisciples gave the bread, but only instrumentally, not really. The Lord\nJesus Himself was the alone Giver of that bread. Our thoughts are\nthus, at once, centred on Him and not on the disciples.\n\nThese Ellipses are variously dealt with in the English Versions\n(both Authorized and Revised). In many cases they are correctly\nsupplied by italics. In some cases the sentences are very erroneously\ncompleted. Sometimes an Ellipsis in the Text is not seen, and\ntherefore is not taken into account in the Translation. Sometimes an\nEllipsis is imagined and supplied where none really exists in the\noriginal.\n\nWhere an Ellipsis is wrongly supplied, or not supplied at all, the\nwords of the Text have to be very freely translated in order to make\nsense, and their literal meaning is sometimes widely departed from.\n\nBut on the other hand, where we correctly supply the Ellipsis-one\nword, it may be-it at once enables us to take all the other words of the\npassage in their literal signification. This is in itself an enormous gain,\nto say nothing of the wonderful light that may be thus thrown upon the\nScripture.\n\nThese Ellipses must not be arbitrarily supplied according to our\nown individual views; we are not at liberty to insert any words,\naccording to our own fancies: but they are all scientifically arranged\nand classified, and each must therefore be filled up, according to\ndefinite principles which are well ascertained, and in obedience to\nlaws which are carefully laid down.\nEllipsis is of three kinds:\nAbsolute Ellipsis,\nRelative Ellipsis, and the\nEllipsis of Repetition:\n\nA. Absolute, where the omitted word or words are to be\nsupplied from the nature of the subject alone.\n\nB. Relative, where the omitted word or words are to be\nsupplied from, and are suggested by the context.\n\nC. The Ellipsis of Repetition, where the omitted word or words\nare to be supplied by repeating them from a clause which\nprecedes or follows.\n\nThese three great divisions may be further set forth as follows:\n\nA. Absolute Ellipsis, where the omitted word or words are to be\nsupplied from the nature of the subject.\n\nI. Nouns and Pronouns.\n\n1. The Nominative.\n\n2. The Accusative.\n\n3. Pronouns.\n\n4. Other connected words.\n\nII. Verbs and Participles:\n\n1. When the verb finite is wanting:\na. especially the verb to say.\n2. When the verb infinitive is wanting:\na. after МЛЙ fo be able.\nb. after the verb fo finish.\nc. after another verb, personal or impersonal.\n3. When the verb substantive is wanting.\n4. When the participle is wanting.\n\nIII. Certain connected words in the same member of a\npassage.\n\nIV. A whole clause in a connected passage:\n1. The first clause.\n2. The latter clause or Apodosis (Anantapodoton).\n3. Acomparison.\n\nB. Relative Ellipsis-\n\nI. Where the omitted word is to be supplied from a cognate\nword in the context.\n\n1. The noun from the verb.\n2. The verb from the noun.\n\nII. Where the omitted word is to be supplied from a contrary\nword.\n\nIII. Where the omitted word is to be supplied from analogous or\nrelated words.\n\nIV. Where the omitted word is contained in another word: the\none word comprising the two significations-(Concisa\nLocutio, Syntheton or Compositio, Constructio Preegnans).\n\nC. Ellipsis of Repetition-\n\nI. Simple: where the Ellipsis is to be supplied from a\npreceding or a succeeding clause.\n\n1. From a preceding clause.\na. Nouns and Pronouns.\nb. Verbs.\nc. Particles.\ni) Negatives.\nii) Interrogatives.\nd. Sentences.\n2. From a succeeding clause.\n\nII. Complex: where the two clauses are mutually involved, and\nthe Ellipsis in the former clause is to be supplied from the\nlatter, and at the same time an Ellipsis in the latter clause is\nto be supplied from the former. (Called also Semiduplex\nOratio).\n\n1. Single words.\n2. Sentences.',''),(2,2,'zeugma','Zeugma; or, Unequal Yoke\n\nZeug’-ma. Greek ζεῦγμα, a yoke; from ζεύγνυµι (zeugnumi), to join or\nyoke together.\n\nThis name is given to the figure, because one verb is yoked on to\ntwo subjects while grammatically it strictly refers only to one of them:\nThe two subjects properly require two different verbs. This figure,\ntherefore, differs from one of the ordinary forms of Ellipsis, where one\nof the two verbs is omitted which belongs to only one clause. (See\nunder Relative Ellipsis, page 62.)\n\nThe second verb is omitted, and the grammatical law is broken, in\norder that our attention may be attracted to the passage, and that we\nmay thus discover that the emphasis is to be placed on the verb that is\nused, and not be distracted from it by the verb that is omitted. Though\nthe law of grammar is violated, it is not “bad grammar’; for it is broken\nwith design, legitimately broken, under the special form, usage, or\nfigure, called ZEUGMA.\n\nSo perfectly was this figure studied and used by the Greeks, that\nthey gave different names to its various forms, according to the\nposition of the verb or yoke in the sentence. There are four forms of\nZeugma:-\n\n1. PROTOZEUGMA, ante-yoke. Latin, INJUNCTUM, joined together.\n2. MESOZEUGMA, middle-yoke. Latin, CONJUNCTUM, joined with.\n3. HYPOZEUGMA, end-yoke; or subjoined.\n4. SYNEZEUGMENON, connected-yoke. Latin, ADJUNCTUM, joined together.',''),(3,3,'asyndeton','Asyndeton; or, No-Ands\n\nThis figure should not be studied apart from the opposite figure\nPOLYSYNDETON (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), as they form a pair, and\nmutually throw light upon and illustrate each other.\n\nIt is pronounced a-syn-de-ton, and means simply without\nconjunctions; or it may be Englished by the term NO-ANDS.\n\nIt is from the Greek a, negative, and σύνδετον (sundeton), bound\ntogether with (from δεῖν, dein, to bind).\n\nHence, in grammar, asyndeton means without any conjunctions.\n\nIt is called also ASYNTHETON, from τίθηµ! (titheemi), to put or\nplace. Hence, Asyntheton means no placings or puttings (i.e., of the\nconjunction “and”).\nOther names for this figure are:-\nDIALYSIS (Di-al’-y-sis), from διά (dia), through, and λύειν\n(luein), to loosen; a loosening through.\nDIALYTON (Di-al’-y-ton), a separation of the parts.\nSOLUTUM (So-lu-tum), from the Latin solvo, to dissolve.\nDISSOLUTIO (Dis-so-lu’-ti-o), a dissolving.\nEPITROCHASMOS (Ep --i-tro-chas‘-mos), from ἐτή (epi), upon,\nand τροχαῖος (trochaios), a running along, tripping along.\nThis name is given also to a certain kind of Parenthesis\n(q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\nPERCURSIO (Per-cur’-si-o), a running through.\nAll these names are given, because, without any “ands” the items\nare soon run over.\nWhen the figure Asyndeton is used, we are not detained over the\nseparate statements, and asked to consider each in detail, but we are\nhurried on over the various matters that are mentioned, as though\nthey were of no account, in comparison with the great climax to which\nthey lead up, and which alone we are thus asked by this figure to\nemphasize.\n\nThe beauties of Asyndeton cannot be fully seen or appreciated\nwithout comparing with it the figure of Polysyndeton. They should be\nstudied together, in order to bring out, by the wonderful contrast, the\nobject and importance of both.\n\nAsyndeta have been divided into four classes:-\n\nConjunctive or copulative, when the words or propositions are\nto be joined together.\n\nDisjunctive, when they are to be separated from each other.\n\nExplanatory, when they explain each other.\n\nCausal, when a reason is subjoined.',''),(4,4,'aphaeresis','Apheresis: or, Front-Cut\n\nPronounced Aph-er’-e-sis, is the Greek word ἀφαίρεσις, and means а\ntaking away from, from ἀφαιρεῖν (aphairein), to take away, from απο.\n(apo), away, αἱρεῖν (hairein), to take. It is a figure of etymology which\nrelates to the spelling of words, and is used of the cutting off of a letter\nor syllable from the beginning of a word. We may, therefore, give it the\nEnglish name of FRONT-CUT. We see it in such words as ‘neath for\nbeneath; mazed for amazed. In the Scripture we have an example in\nConiah for Jeconiah. He is called Jeconiah in his genealogy (1Ch.\n3:16); but, in Jer. 22:24, where Jehovah declares that He will cut him\noff, his name corresponds with the act, for the front part is cut off, and\nhe is called “Coniah.”* [Note: Only here, and in 37:1.]\n\nJeconiah means Let Jehovah establish. Cutting off the first syllable\nmay intimate the disappointment (for the time) of the hope.\n\nJosiah, who justified the hope expressed in his name (Let Jehovah\nheal) that Jehovah would establish the kingdom, gave his son the\nname of Eliakim, afterwards called Jehoiakim, which means God will\nestablish (as does his grandson’s, Jehoiachin-this Jeconiah). But his\nhopes were vain. Josiah’s family is remarkable for the manner in\nwhich the names are broken up and their kingdom overtaken by\ndisaster.\n\nSee Jer. 22:24. “As | live, saith the Lord, though Coniah, the son of\nJehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet\nwould | pluck thee thence”; and read on to the end of the chapter.\n\nIn verse 30, “Write ye this man childless” is explained to mean that\nnot one of his seven sons (1Ch. 3:17-18) sat upon his throne, but\nZerubbabel, his grandson, became governor after Coniah had died in\nBabylon (2Ki. 25:29-30).',''),(5,5,'apocope','Apocope; or, End-Cut\n\nA-péc’-o-pe is the Greek word ἁποκοπή, a cutting off, from\natrokotrTelv (apokoptein), to cut off, and this from ἁπό (apo), away\nfrom, and кбптем (koptein), to cut. № is a figure of etymology which\nrelates to the spelling of words, and is used of cutting off a letter or\nsyllable from the end of a word. We may give it the name of END-\nCUT. We have examples in such words as yon for yonder, after for\nafterward.\n\nIn the Scripture we have an example in the name of Jude for\nJudas.\n\nThere is no Apocope in the Greek; and therefore there is no\nteaching in the use of the figure; which exists only in the translation.','hallo this is the new rules'),(6,6,'aposiopesis','Aposiopesis; or, Sudden-Silence\n\nThis is a rhetorical figure, and not a figure of grammar, but it may be\nplaced under the figures depending on omission, because in it\nsomething is omitted.\n\nApo-si-o-pee-sis is the Greek word ἁποσιώπησις (a becoming\nsilent), from ἀποσιωπάω (aposi?pa?), to be silent after speaking, to\nkeep silence, observe a deliberate silence.\n\nThe name of this figure may be represented in English by\nSUDDEN-SILENCE. The Latins named it RETICENTIA, which means\nthe same thing. It is the sudden breaking off of what is being said (or\nwritten), so that the mind may be the more impressed by what is too\nwonderful, or solemn, or awful for words: or when a thing may be, as\nwe sometimes say, “better imagined than described.”\n\nIts use is to call our attention to what is being said, for the purpose\nof impressing us with its importance.\n\nIt has been divided under four heads, according to the character of\nthe subject:-\n\n1. Promise.\n\n2. Anger and Threatening.\n\n3. Grief and Complaint.\n\n4. Enquiry and Deprecation.',''),(7,7,'meiosis','Meiosis: or, A Be-Littleing\n\n(A be-littleing of one thing to magnify another)\nMei-??-sis. Greek µείωσις, a lessening, or diminution: from µειόω\n(mei-o-?), to make smaller.\n\nIt is known also by the name LITOTES, /i’-to-tees: Greek λιότης,\nplainness, simplicity.\n\nThe Latins called it DIMINUTIO (Di-mi-nu-ti-o) and EXTENUATIO\n(Ex-ten’-u-a’-ti-o).\n\nBy this figure one thing is diminished in order to increase another\nthing. It thus differs from Tapeinosis (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ), in which\na thing is lessened in order to emphasize its own greatness or\nimportance.\n\nIn Meiosis there is an omission therefore, not of words, but of\nsense. One thing is lowered in order to magnify and intensify\nsomething else by way of contrast.\n\nIt is used for the purpose of emphasis; to call our attention, not to\nthe smallness of the thing thus lessened, but to the importance of that\nwhich is put in contrast with it.',''),(8,8,'tapeinosis','Tapeinosis; or, Demeaning\n\n(A lessening of a thing in order to increase it)\nTa-pei-n??-sis. Greek ταπείνωσις, a demeaning or humbling.\n\nThis differs from Meiosis in that in Meiosis one thing is diminished\nin order, by contrast, to increase the greatness of another, or\nsomething else.\n\nWhereas, in Tapeinosis the thing that is lessened is the same thing\nwhich is increased and intensified.\n\nThe figure was also called ANTENANTIOSIS. Ant’-en-an-ti-o -sis\nfrom амт! (anti), over against, or instead of, and ἐναντίος (enantios),\nopposite.\n\nWhen the figure is used parenthetically, it is called ANRESIS. See\nbelow under Parenthesis.\n\nThe figure is used in connection with nouns, verbs, and adverbs,\n\n1. Positively.\n\n2. Negatively.',''),(9,9,'catabasis','Catabasis (See Anabasis)',''),(10,10,'syllogismus','Syllogismus; or, Omission of the Conclusion\n\nSyl’-lo-gis’-mus. Greek, συλλογισμός, a reckoning altogether, a\nbringing of all the premisses; and, the conclusion before the mind.\nFrom σύν (sun), together, and λογίζεσθαι (logizesthai), to reckon.\n(Hence the word “logic”).\n\nThe regular form of every argument consists of three propositions\nof which the first two are called “premisses” (the first being the major,\nand the latter the minor), while the last, which necessarily follows from\nthem, is called the “conclusion.”\n\nBut the term Syllogismus is given to this figure because it is a\ndeparture from this rule, the law of logic being legitimately broken for\nthe sake of emphasis.\n\nIt falls into this division because it is a figure of Rhetoric, in which\nsomething is omitted for the sake of emphasis. It is not the omission of\nwords, as such, as in Ellipsis; or of sense, as in Meiosis or Tapeinosis;\nbut it is a figure in which the premisses are stated, but the conclusion\nis omitted, and left to the imagination to enhance and heighten the\neffect; as when we say, “it can be better imagined than described.”\nIndeed, so great is the emphasis which is thus acquired that the Latins\ngave it other names.\n\nThey called it SIGNIFICATIO, because something is signified\nwhich is not expressed:\n\nRATIOCINATIO, or Reasoning, because only the Reasons (and\nnot the conclusion) are stated; or, special importance is given to the\nreasons, even though the conclusion may be given (See Rom. 3:1-31)\n\nAnd it is called EMPHASIS, because of the emphasis thus given to\nthe argument which is omitted.',''),(11,11,'enthymema','Enthymema; or, Omission of Premiss\n\nEn’-thy-mee-ma. Greek ἐνθύμημα, a thought or a consideration.\n\nThis is the opposite of Syllogismus.\n\nIn Syllogismus, the premisses are stated, but the conclusion is\nomitted; while, in Enthymema, the conclusion is stated and one or\nboth of the premisses omitted.\n\nBoth are alike, therefore, in being an abbreviated Syllogism.\n\nIt is also related to Hypocatastasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), in\nthat it is an implication. But in Hypocatastasis it is an ordinary\nstatement or word which is to be implied; while, in Enthymema it is the\npremiss of an argument which is left to be supplied.\n\nThe Latins call it COMMENTUM, a thought or a contrivance, and\n\nCONCEPTIO, the wording or drawing up of a statement.\n\nIt may be illustrated thus:-“We are dependent; we should,\ntherefore, be humble.” Here the major premiss is omitted-“dependent\npersons should be humble.”',''),(12,12,'homoeopropheron','Homeeopropheron; or, Alliteration\n\nThe Repetition of the same Letter or Syllable at the commencement of\nSuccessive Words\nHo-mee-o-proph’-e-ron, from ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and προφέρω\n(propherd), to carry, or place before: i.e., Successive words which\ncarry the same letter or the same syllable before, or at the beginning.\nThis figure, therefore, is the repetition of the same letter or syllable\n\nat the beginning of two or more words in close succession. Its English\nname is ALLITERATION (from ad, to, and litera, letter). Churchill\nspeaks of “Apt Alliteration’s Artful Aid.”\nThis figure is seen, of course, only in the Hebrew and the Greek. It\nis difficult to reproduce it in a translation. And where it occurs in the\nEnglish it may be only accidental, and carry no weight or emphasis.',''),(13,13,'homoeoteleuton','Homeeoteleuton; or, Like Endings\n\nThe Repetition of the same Letters or Syllables at the end of\nSuccessive Words\nHepr-moe-o-tel-eu’-ton. From ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and Τελευτή\n(teleutee), an ending, i.e., words with like endings.\n\nThis is the opposite Figure to Homoeopropheron; and is used\nwhen successive words end with the same or similar letters or\nsyllables.\n\nThese two figures are for the most part involved in others which\naffect the whole of the connected words; and therefore we shall meet\nwith other examples as we proceed.',''),(14,14,'homoeoptoton','Homeeoptoton: or, Like Inflections\n\nThe Repetition of Inflections\nHo-me-op ‘-to-ton, from ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and TrTWoic (ptqpsis), a\nfalling, which in grammar means an inflection: i.e., a case formed by\nthe declining of a noun, or tenses, είο., in the conjugation of a verb: as\nin the Latin message of Julius Сбзаг, “veni, vidi, vici,” i.e., “I came, |\nsaw, | conquered.”\n\nThis figure differs from the two former, in that the endings are not\nonly similar, but the similarity arises from the same inflections of verbs\nor nouns, etc.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that this figure belongs peculiarly to the\nOriginal languages, and cannot always be transferred in translation.',''),(15,15,'paromoeosis','Paromeeosis: or, Like-Sounding Inflections\n\nThe Repetition of Inflections similar in Sound\n\nPar’-o-moe-o-sis. Greek, παροµοίωσις, assimilation, especially of\nwords; assonance. It is from παρά (para), beside, and ὅμοιωσις\n(homoosis), likeness.\n\nIt is called also PAROMCEON, παρόµοιον, nearly like.\nSometimes it is wrongly called Parechesis, παρήχησις, likeness of\nsound or tone, from παρά, beside, and ἦχος (eechos), a sound, or\nἤχησις (eecheesis), a sounding. But Parechesis properly describes\nthe figure when one of the two words belongs to another language, or\nwhen the similarity is seen only in the original language and not in the\ntranslation. See Parechesis.',''),(16,16,'acrostichion','Acrostichion: or, Acrostic\n\nRepetition of the same or successive Letters at the beginnings of\nWords or Clauses\n\nThe English name of this figure is Ac-ros’-tic, and comes from the\nGreek, ἄκρος (akros), at the point (i.e., at the beginning or the end)\nand στίχος (stichos), a row or order. It is a figure of repetition, not of\nthe same letter, but of different letters at the beginning or end of words\narranged in lines.\n\nThese letters may be thus repeated at the beginning or end of\nlines, either in the same order in which they occur in the Alphabet (in\nwhich case they are called ABECEDARIAN), or in some other certain\nor particular order, making the letters at the beginning or end of\nsuccessive lines or words spell another word.\n\nThe Greeks gave it another name, PARASTICHIS (парасту!с)\nfrom παρά (para), beside, and στίχος (stichos), a row, meaning that\nthe letters are placed at the side.\nBy the use of this peculiar figure, our attention is attracted to the\nspecial importance of certain passages. There are thirteen such\npassages in the Scriptures, and whenever we meet with them, we are\nasked to give great attention to them, and to put marked emphasis\nupon them.',''),(17,17,'epizeuxis','Epizeuxis: or, Duplication\n\nThe Repetition of the Same Word in the Same Sense\nWhen the word is repeated in close and immediate succession, no\nother word or words coming between, it is called GEMINATIO,\npronounced Gem-i-ner-tio, which means a doubling, duplication, a re-\ndoubling. № is also called ITERATIO  (lér-er-e-ti-o), iteration;\nCONDUPLICATIO (con-dbi-pli-car-tio), conduplication, or full doubling.\nWhen the words do not immediately succeed each other, but are\nseparated by one or more intervening words, the figure is then called\nEPIZEUXIS, pronounced Ер --геих -is. It is the Greek word ἐπήζευξις,\nfrom ἐτῆ (epi), upon, and ζεύγνυμµί (zeugnumi), to yoke, or join closely\ntogether. The intervening words thus form the yoke which joins the\nrepeated words.\n\nThe Latins give this figure the name of SUBJUNCTIO (Subjunc-\ntio), which is derived from the Greek and has exactly the same\nmeaning, subjoining (from jugum, a yoke).\n\nWe may give the figure the English name of “Duplication,”\n“Gemination,” “Iteration,” or “Repetition.”\n\nIt is a common and powerful way of emphasizing a particular word,\nby thus marking it and calling attention to it.\n\nIn writing, one might accomplish this by putting the word in larger\nletters, or by underlining it two or three times. In speaking, it is easy to\nmark it by expressing it with increased emphasis or vehemence.\n\nHow important for us to notice, in the Scriptures, the words and\nexpressions which the Holy Spirit has thus marked and emphasized in\norder to impress us with their importance!',''),(18,18,'anaphora','Anaphora; or, Like Sentence-Beginnings\n\nThe Repetition of the same Word at the beginning of successive\nSentences\n\nA-naph’-o-ra, from two Greek words, dvd (ana), again, and φέρω\n(pherdb), to bring or carry. It means a carrying back, reference, or\nrepeating over again.\n\nThis figure is also sometimes called EPANAPHORA: which is the\nsame word with ἐπή (epi), upon, prefixed. In Latin it is called RELATIO.\n\nThis figure is so-called because it is the repeating of the same\nword at the beginning of successive clauses: thus adding weight and\nemphasis to statements and arguments by calling special attention to\nthem.\n\nAnaphora differs from Epibole (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). In the\ncase of Epibole several words are repeated, consisting of a sentence\nor phrase; whereas, in Anaphora only one word is thus repeated.\nScripture abounds with this figure, which adds great importance to\nmany of its solemn statements.',''),(19,19,'epanalepsis','Epanalepsis; or, Resumption\n\nThe repetition of the same word after a break, or parenthesis\nEp’-an-a-lep‘-sis. № is from the Greek ἐπί (epi), upon, ava (ana),\nagain, and Ajiwic (leepsis), a taking; and means a taking up upon\nagain.\n\nIn Latin it is called RESUMPTIO (Re-sump -tio).\n\nIn this figure the word is resumed, rather than repeated, from the\nbeginning of another sentence: and when the word is resumed after a\nparenthesis it is called APOSTASIS, and the parenthesis is closed by\nthe apostasis.\n\nA-pos’-ta-sis is from the Greek ἁπόστασις, which means a\nstanding away or off from, distance, interval; the repeated word which\nresumes the statement or argument, standing away at a distance from\nthe first word.\n\nMoreover, the word so taken up and resumed may not be\nnecessarily from the beginning of the sentence, but it may be taken up\nagain from the middle or from any other part, as in this sentence:-\n\n“The persecutions undergone by the Apostles were a trial to their faith, and a\nconfirmation to ours; a trial to them,” etc.\n\nIt differs from Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) in that the\nrepeated words are not immediately successive, but are separated by\na break or parenthesis: the repetition being a resumption of what the\nwriter or speaker had already before begun to say.',''),(20,20,'polysyndeton','Polysyndeton; or, Many-ands\n\nThe repetition of the word “and” at the beginning of successive\n\nclauses\nPol’-y-syn’-de-ton. Greek, πολυσύδετον, from πολύς (polbis), many,\nand συνδετόν (syndeton), bound together; hence, in grammar, it\nmeans a conjunction (from σύν (syn) and δεῖν (dein), to bind). The\nword, therefore, means much bound together or many conjunctions.\n\nIt is called also POLYSYNTHETON, from τίθηµ! (titheemi), to put\nor place. Hence many puttings: i.e., of the same word-in this case of\nthe word “and.”\n\nThe English name for the Figure will, therefore, be MANY-ANDS.\n\nPolysyndeton is merely one special form of Anaphora (q.v. [Note:\nWhich see.] ): i.e., it is a repetition of the same word at the beginning\nof successive sentences: but this is always one special word “and.”\nTo understand the full significance and use of Polysyndeton, the\nstudent must consider along with it the opposite Figure A-syndeton\n(the same word syndeton with “a” prefixed, meaning no, instead of\n“poly,” meaning many). See A-syn’-de-ton, i.e., NO-ANDS (page 137).\n\nThe two Figures form a pair, and should be studied together.\n\nThe Laws of Grammar decide for us how the conjunction “and”\nshould be used. If we are enumerating a number of things, we (by\nusage) place the conjunction immediately before the last. This is the\ncold law, which leaves what we say without any special emphasis. But\nthis law may be legitimately broken in two different ways for the sake\nof emphasis. In order to attract the attention of the hearer or reader,\nwe may either use NO ANDS, or we may use MANY ANDS. Man may\nuse these figures, however, without sufficient reason, and unwisely:\nbut the Holy Spirit ever uses words in all perfection, and it behoves us\ncarefully to note whatever He thus calls our attention to.\nWhen He uses “No-ands,” He does not ask us to stop and\nconsider the various particulars which are enumerated, but to hasten\non to some grand climax. In this case that climax which we read at the\nend, is the all-important matter on which the greatest emphasis is to\nbe placed.\n\nWhen He uses “many-ands,” there is never any climax at the end.\nInstead of hurrying us on, breathlessly, to reach the important\nconclusion; we are asked to stop at each point, to Weigh each matter\nthat is presented to us, and to consider each particular that is thus\nadded and emphasized.',''),(21,21,'epistrophe','Epistrophe; or, Like Sentence-Endings\n\nThe Repetition of the same Word or Words at the end of successive\nSentences\nE-pis’-tro-phee.

The figure is so-called because the\nword which ends one sentence is repeated at the beginning of the\nnext.\nThe words so repeated are thus emphasised as being the most\nimportant words in the sentence, which we are to mark and consider\nin translation and exposition.\n\nThe Massorah* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Massorah, Rubrics 422 and\n423, Vol. Il. €.] gives two lists of such words; which we have included\nin our examples, marking them with an asterisk.\n\nThe figure is frequently missed in the English translation, both in\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] In these\ncases we have given our own translation of the original, so as to bring\nout and exhibit the words which are thus affected by the figure of\nAnadiplosis.\n\n*Gen. 1:1-2.-“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\nAnd the earth became without form and void.”\n\nThus Anadiplosis is the very first Figure employed in the Bible.\nAnd it is used to call our attention to, and emphasize, the fact that,\nwhile the first statement refers to two things, “the heaven and the\nearth”; the following statement proceeds to speak of only one of them,\nleaving the other entirely out of consideration.\nBoth were created “in the beginning.” But the earth, at some time,\nand by some means, and from some cause (not stated) became a\nruin:-empty, waste, and desolate; or, as it is expressed by another\nFigure (Paronomasia, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), tohoo and bohoo.\nNow, whatever may be the meaning of tohoo (Wal), it is expressly\nstated, in Isa. 45:18, by Him who created the earth that “He created it\nnot tohoo (Ualy.” Therefore it must at, and after some subsequent\nperiod of unknown duration, have fallen into the ruin which the second\nverse declares and describes.\n\nThe repetition of the word “earth” here, directs our attention to this\nfact; and proceeds to describe the process by which the earth was\nrestored and peopled.\n\nThe whole chapter exhibits a parallel between this work, and that\n“new creation” [Note: Compare 2Co. 4:6; 20ο. 5:17, etc.; and see a\npamphlet on “The New Creation and the Old,” by the same author and\npublisher.] which takes place in the case of every one who is born\nagain of the Holy Ghost, and has the new man created within him.',''),(26,26,'climax','Climax; or, Gradation\n\nRepeated Anadiplosis\n\nWhen Anadiplosis is repeated in successive sentences, it is called\nClimax, from κλῖμαξ (klimax), a ladder, a gradual ascent, a going up by\nsteps.\nHence, in Latin, it is called SCALA, a ladder; GRADUS, a step; or,\nGRADATIO, a gradation.\n\nBy some, it is called EPIPLOCE (e-pip -/o-ce), a folding upon.\n\nThere are two figures to which this name is sometimes given.\nThere is a climax where only words are concerned, and a climax\nwhere the sense is concerned. A climax of words is a figure of\nGrammar; and a climax of sense is a figure of Rhetoric. We have\nconfined our use of the word climax to the former; as there are other\nnames appropriated to the latter. A Climax in Rhetoric is known as\nAnabasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), where the gradation is upward;\nand Catabasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), where it is downward: and\nthese have other alternative titles. See below under figures of sense.\n\nClimax relates to words; and is, as we have said, a repeated\nAnadiplosis, or a combination of successive Anadiplosis and\nEpanadiplosis: where the /ast word of one sentence is repeated as the\nfirst word of the next, and the last of this next sentence is repeated as\nthe first word of the sentence following, and so on.\n\nSometimes there may be two or three words, only one of which is\nrepeated; or the repeated noun may be represented by a pronoun.\n\nIt is a beautiful figure, very expressive; and at once attracts our attention to the importance of a passage.',''),(27,27,'mesarchia','Mesarchia; or, Beginning and Middle Repetition\n\nThe Repetition of the same Word or Words at the beginning and\nmiddle of successive Sentences\nMes-ar’-chi-a’, from the Greek µέσος (mesos), middle, and ἀρχή\n(archee), beginning, because the same word or words are repeated at\n\nthe beginning and middle of successive sentences.\n\nIt differs little from Anaphora, where the sentences are\nindependent.\n\nIt resembles also Epizeuxis, when the repetition comes very close\ntogether.',''),(28,28,'mesodiplosis','Mesodiplosis; or, Middle Repetition\n\nThe Repetition of the same Word or Words in the middle of\nsuccessive Sentences\n\nMes-o-dip-lo‘sis, from the Greek µέσος (mesos), middle, and\nὅππλωσις (αἱριφσίς), a doubling.

But as that figure already has several names,\nand there is another form of repetition which seems to be without a\nname, we have appropriated Repetitio (i.e., Repetition), to that form\nwhich comes under none of the figures already enumerated.\n\nA word or words are repeated, not in immediate succession, as in\nEpizeuxis; not at the beginning, middle, or end of sentences (as in\nthose just treated); not at definite intervals; but frequently in the same\npassage and irregularly for the sake of emphasizing and calling\nattention to it.\n\nThe name clearly defines the nature of the figure, which may\nfrequently be met with.',''),(31,31,'polyptoton','Polyptoton; or, Many Inflections\n\nThe Repetition of the same Part of Speech in different Inflections\nPo-lypr-tep-ton. Greek, πολύττωτον; from πολύς (ро!ы5), many, and\nTITWOIC (ptqsis), a falling: in grammar, a case (from an assumed form\nπτόω, ρίοφ, to fall). Hence, Polyptoton means with many cases, {8., a\nrepetition of the same noun in several cases, or of the same verb in\nseveral moods or tenses. With many inflections is a definition which\ncovers both nouns and verbs.\n\nIt is called also METAGOGE (met-a-gqb-gee). Greek μεταγωγή,\nfrom µετά (meta), a change, and Gyw (адф), to lead. It means а\nchange of course; a different arrangement of the same word, a leading\nof the same word through different inflections.\n\nIn Latin it is called CASUUM VARIETAS, a variety of cases.\n\nThis figure, therefore, is a repetition of the same word in the same\nsense, but not in the same form: from the same root, but in some\nother termination; as that of case, mood, tense, person, degree,\nnumber, gender, etc.\n\nBy “case,” etc., is to be understood not merely the case of nouns,\nbut inflections of all kinds.\n\nWe have arranged the different forms of Polyptoton, as follows:-\n\nI. Verbs.\n1. Verbs repeated in different moods and tenses.\n2. Verbs with their imperatives, or participles (HOMOGENE).\na. In strong affirmation.\nb. In strong negation.\n3.

Hence, a\nbreaking up against. This name is given to this figure; because, when\na word has been used once in a sentence in its plain and natural\nsense, it is used again in the same sentence in another sense which\nbreaks up against it. It is the use of the same word in the same\nsentence in two different senses. It is essential to this figure that the\ntwo words must be the same in spelling.* [Note: This differs from a\nHomonym (see Appendix D), which is a different word though spelt in\nthe same way.] When they are similar in spelling but alike in sound,\nthe figure is known by another name, Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee] ).\n\nIt is in frequent use in all languages: e.g., “while we live, let us\nlive”: or “learn some craft while you are young that when you are old\nyou may live without craft.”\n\nWhen the Declaration of American Independence was being\nsigned, Hancock said, “We must be unanimous; there must be no\npulling different ways.” “Yes,” said Franklin, “we must all hang\ntogether, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.”\n\nA correspondent recently wrote concerning a certain subject: “The\nmore | think of it the less | think of it,” where the meaning is obvious.',''),(33,33,'ploce','Ploce: or, Word-Folding\n\nPronounced plo-kee. Greek πλοκή (plokee), a fold or plait, from\nπλέκω (plekqp), to twine, twist, weave, or braid.\n\nAs in Antanaclasis, the same word is repeated in a different sense.\nOnly with Ploce that sense implies more than the first use of it. It often\nexpresses a property or attribute of it. “His wife is a wife indeed.” In\nthat great victory “C@sar was C@sar.” Lord Chatham says, speaking of\nOliver Cromwell, “He astonished mankind by his intelligence, yet did\nnot derive it from spies in the cabinet of every prince in Europe; he\ndrew it from the cabinet of his own sagacious mind. He observed\nfacts, and traced them forward to their consequences.”\n\nIn our examples from Scripture, we will not give two separate lists\nof these figures, as it is often very difficult to classify them. In many of\nthe examples the reader will have, however, little difficulty in\ndistinguishing them. Other names are also used for this figure, either\nsynonymous, or referring to some special variation, or shade of\nmeaning. It is sometimes called HOMOGENE (ὁμογενής), hqo’mo-\ngenes, from ὁμός, the same, and γένος, kind: i.e., of the same family:\nin the case of words from the same root or origin: and is thus more\nappropriately confined to the figure Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which see.]\n).\n\nANACLASIS, ап -а-с/1аз -15, a breaking back.\n\nANTISTASIS (ἀνήστασις), an-tis’-ta-sis, a standing against, or\nopposition. So called because the one word stands against the other\nin an opposite sense. In Rhetoric, the figure is used where an action is\ndefended by showing that something worse would have happened if it\nhad not been done.\n\nDIALOGIA (di-a-log~-i-a), the interchange of words or of their\nmeanings.\n\nIn Latin the figure is called\n\nREFRACTIO (re-frac’-ti-o), a breaking back; similar in meaning to\nAntanaclasis.\n\nRECIPROCATIO (re-cip’-ro-ca‘-ti-o), interchange of words or\nmeanings.\nThere are instances of two words being spelt exactly alike, and yet\nhaving different meanings. These are called HOMONYMS. We can\nhardly class them with Figures of Speech, because they are not used\nas such, and are not used in Repetitions.

It is the figure of Epanodos with this special added object\nof opposing words against one another.\n\nIt is also called DIALLELON, from διά (dia), through, and λαλέω\n(laleo), to speak, to say (or place by speaking) one thing against\nanother. Also METATHESIS, Me-tath’-e-sis, i.e., transposition, from\nµετά (meta), beyond, or over, and пп (titheemi), to place. This\nname is also given in Etymology, where /etters are transposed.

The figure is so-called\nbecause one word is placed alongside of another, which sounds and\nseems like a repetition of it. But it is not the same; it is only similar.\nThe meaning may be similar or not, the point is that two (or more)\nwords are different in origin and meaning, but are similar in sound or\nappearance.\n\nSome rhetoricians misname this figure Prosonomasia, others\ninclude it in Antanaclasis or Parechesis.\n\nThe Latins called it ANNOMINATIO, or AGNOMINATIO, from ad,\nto, and nominatio, a naming (from nominare, to name). The word thus\nhas the same meaning as the Greek name.\n\nThis figure is not by any means what we call a pun. Far from it. But\ntwo things are emphasized, and our attention is called to this\nemphasis by the similarity of sound. Otherwise, we might read the\npassage, and pass it by unnoticed; but the eye or the ear is at once\nattracted by the similarity of sound or appearance, and our attention is\nthus drawn to a solemn or important statement which would otherwise\nhave been unheeded. Sometimes a great lesson is taught us by this\nfigure; an interpretation is put upon the one word by the use of the\nother; or a reason is given in the one for what is referred to by the\nother. Sometimes a contrast is made; sometimes a thought is added.\nThe figure is very frequently used and is never to be disregarded.\nThis figure is common to all languages, but the instances cannot\nreadily be translated from one language into another. In some cases\nwe have attempted to express the Hebrew or Greek words by the use\nof similar words in English; but this is generally at the sacrifice of exact\ntranslation. Only by a very free translation of the sentence can the two\nwords be thus represented.\n\nSometimes we have found even this to be impossible: but in each\ncase we have given the original words in English characters, so that\nthe similarity of sound may be perceived. We have not in each case\nstopped to point the lesson taught by the figure, as it is generally\nsufficiently plain and clear.\n\nNeither have we made any classification of the passages,\notherwise they might well be divided into those which are connected\nwith proper names, or prophetic denunciations, etc. Or we might have\nclassified them as (1) synonymous; (2) antithetic; and (3) of varied\nsignification.',''),(41,41,'parechesls','Parechesls; or, Foreign Paronomasia\n\nThe Repetition of Words similar in Sound, but different in Language\n\nPar-ee-che -sis. Greek, παρήξησις: from παρά (para), beside, and ἠξή\n(eechee), a sound, a sounding of one word beside another.\n\nParechesis is a Paronomasia, when the repeated words of similar\nsound are in another tongue.\n\nThe examples of Paronomasia which we have given are such only\nin the Hebrew and the Greek, not in the English rendering of them\nThere is no figure in the English Translation; except when it may be\npossible to reproduce the similar words in translation (as is done in\nRom. 10:19, disobedience and obedience, etc.). So far as the English\nis concerned, and as related to it, all the examples of Paronomasia\nare really Parechesis, because they exist in another language and not\nin the translation of it.\nSimilarly, as the New Testament (if not originally written in Hebrew,\nand then at a very early date translated into Greek) is at least full of\nHebrew thought and idiom. (See under Idiom.) So that, though there\nmay be no Paronomasia in the Greek words, there may be in the\nHebrew thought, or in the Hebrew words which the Greek words\nrepresent. In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew\nthought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And\nit is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the\nHebrew words sounding beside the Greek words.\n\nTo put the difference in a simpler form: Two words similar in sound\nare a Paronomasia with regard to their particular language, both\nwords being in the same language. But a Parechesis is found when\nthe two words are not in the same language.\n\nThe Greeks also called this figure\n\nPAROMCEOSIS, from παρόμοιος, very much alike; and\n\nPARISON or PARISOSIS, from παρά (para), beside, and ἴσος\n(isos), equal to.\n\nSo that words equal to other words in one language are seen to be\nsimilar to those in another language when placed beside them.',''),(42,42,'synonymia','Synonymia; or, Synonymous Words\n\nThe Repetition of Words similar in Sense, but different in Sound and\nOrigin\n\nSyn-o-nym -i-a, from σύν (sun), together with, and ὄνομα (onoma), а\nname. A Synonym is so Called when the sense of two or more words\nis similar, though the sound and appearance and derivation may be\nquite different. Synonyms do not make the figure called Synonymia\nunless they are used for the purpose of enhancing the force and fire of\nthe passage.\n\nThe Figure of Synonymia is a repetition of words different in sound\nand origin, but similar in shades of meaning. When used rhetorically-\nrepeating the same sentence in other words-it has a variety of uses, to\nwhich distinct names have been given according to the nature of the\nsubject, or the object of the speaker. See below under the next section\n(Section ΙΙ., Repetition, affecting the sense).\n\nSynonymia, when employed by man, is often an unnecessary and\nvain repetition of empty words; but, when used by the Holy Spirit, it\ncauses the mind to look again and again at the subject. Man may use\nit to expose his unhappy vanity: but God uses it to emphasize His\nwisdom, power, or purpose, when words of similar meaning are\nheaped together to attract the attention, and impress the mind.\n\nWe have not, except in a few important instances, attempted to\ndefine the various Synonyms employed.

They used it, however, and this is the all-\nimportant point.\n\nIt is a special form of Synonymia, the synonyms being negatives of\ndifferent kinds heaped together for a special purpose.\n\nNegatives are repeated even in English to strengthen and increase\nthe emphasis: just as we say “No, no,” “No, | will not.” But in the Greek\nthis is done much more emphatically. Two or more negatives are used\nto strengthen the assertion.\n\nThese negatives are οὐ (ou) and µή (mee), which both equally\nmean no or not.\nAs we are now considering their combined use we need not too\nclosely define their separate use. Otherwise we might enlarge on the\nfact that the one, oU (ou), denies absolutely what is a matter of fact,\nand negatives an affirmation: the other µή (mee) denies hypothetically\nwhat is implied, and negatives a supposition.\n\nThis difference may be seen in such passages as 1Co. 2:14 (οὐ).\nJoh. 3:18, where we have οὐ in the first sentence, and µή (both times)\nin the second.',''),(44,44,'cycloides','Cycloides; or, Circular Repetition\n\nThe Repetition of the same Phrase at regular Intervals\n\nCy-clo-id’-es means having the form of a circle; from κύκλος (kuklos).\na circle, and εἶδος (eidos), form.\n\nThe figure is so called because the sentence or phrase is repeated\nat intervals, as though in regular circles.\n\nWhen this repetition occurs at the end of successive passages, as\nin poetry, in the form of a Refrain or Burden, it is called AMCEBZON\n(α.ν.

De\nRossi,* [Note: Kitto. Bib. Cyc. Ill. 702.] a learned Jew of the sixteenth\ncentury, first published a mass of information on the subject in a\nremarkable work, Meor Enajim (i.e., The Light of the Eyes).

(15th Ed. 1857).] , which deals with the construction\nof lines: and Bishop Jebb in his Sacred Literature extended the study.\nBut none of these got beyond Parallelism as it is applied to lines.

Simple.\n1. Synonymous or Gradational.\n2. Antithetic or Opposite.\n3. Synthetic or Constructive.\nII. Complex.\n1. Alternate. Two lines repeated only once (four lines in all).\n2. Repeated Alternation. Two lines repeated more than once.\n3. Extended Alternation. Three or more lines repeated.\n4. Introverted.',''),(50,50,'correspondance','Correspondence\n\nIt was reserved for Thomas Boys to extend and develope the study of\nParallelism.\n\nWhat others before him had thought to be confined to\nlines, or only to short passages, he discerned to be true also of whole\nparagraphs; yea, of whole sections and even of books. He therefore\ndiscarded the term Parallelism as being altogether inadequate when\nused of paragraphs and subjects. He adopted the term\nCorrespondence as applying to and covering all the Phenomena\nconnected with the structure of the sacred text. In 1824 he gave the\nworld his Tactica Sacra, and in the following year he gave his Key to\nthe Book of Psalms, which opened out the whole subject, and gave\nsome examples from the Psalms. In 1890, Dr. Bullinger edited from\nMr. Boys’s Interleaved Hebrew Bible, and other of his papers,* [Note:\nThese were most kindly placed at his service by the Rev. Sydney\nThelwall (Vicar of Radford), in whose possession they are. See Mr.\nThelwall’s preface to the Key to Psalms.] a complete edition of the\nwhole 150 Psalms, which he called, “A Key to the Psalms,” thus\nconnecting it with the work published in 1825.\n\nThis law of Correspondence is seen in the Repetition of Subjects,\nrather than of Lines, or Propositions.\n\nThese subjects may be repeated in three different ways, or rather\nin two, for the third is only a combination of the other two. They may\nbe repeated alternately; or they may be introverted, when it is called\nChiasmus (and sometimes Epanodos); or these two may be combined\nin innumerable ways.\n\nEach of the subjects occupies a separate paragraph, and these we\ncall members. These members may be of any length; one may be\nvery short, the other quite long. A longer member may be again\ndivided up and expanded, as each member possesses its own\nseparate structure, and this again may be part of one still larger.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, we arbitrarily place letters against\neach member for the purpose of distinguishing it from the others and\nof linking it to its corresponding member, as well as for easy reference.\nUsing Roman and Italic type we are enabled to mark the different\nsubjects which correspond, or are set in contrast, the one with the\nother\n\nThus the subject of the member marked “A” (Roman type) will be\nthe same subject which is repeated in A (Italic type). The same with В\nand В, a and а, b and b.\n\nIn whatever form we may have this figure, it is always of the\ngreatest possible use and importance. It enables us not merely to\nperceive the symmetrical perfection of the passage, but to understand\nits true sense; to see its scope and thus be guided to a sound\ninterpretation.\n\nWhat may be obscure in one member may be clear in its\ncorresponding member.\n\nThe subject, which may not be mentioned in one member may be\nnamed in the other. We are thus helped to a correct interpretation. For\nexample, in the structure of 1Pe. 3:18-22 it is not clear who or what\nmay be “the in-prison-spirits” of verse 19. But in the corresponding\nmember (verse 22) they are mentioned by name as “angels.” We thus\nlearn that the subject of the former member (verse 19) is the\ndisobedience of angels in the days of Noah (Gen. 6:1-22), while the\nsubject of the latter (verse 22) is the subjection of angels and\nauthorities and powers. Having thus got the scope of the passage, we\nget the meaning of “spirits,” and remember how it is written, “He\nmaketh His angels spirits” (Psa. 104:4. Heb. 1:7). We at once connect\ntheir sin in the days of Noah and their prison with Gen. 6:1. 2Pe. 2:4,\nand Jud. 1:6. We thus have the clue to the true interpretation of this\npassage, which if followed out will lead to a correct exegesis.* [Note:\nSee a pamphlet on The Spirits in Prison, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nFor another example see Psa. 144:1-15. (page 33), where the\nstructure (an extended alternation) clearly shows that verses 12-15\nconsist of the “vanity” which the “strange children” speak, and the\n“falsehood” which they utter. The Psalm ends with a solemn\nconclusion (15), which stands out apart from the structure by itself in\nall its solemnity.\n\nPsa. 144:1-15 -\nА 1-4. Thanksgiving.\nВ 5-7. Prayer (“Bow thy heavens,” etc.).\nC 8. Description of the strange children and their vain words: “Whose mouth,” etc.\nА 9, 10. Thanksgiving.\nВ 11. Prayer (“Rid me”).\nC 11-15. Description of the strange children. After ror “who” in verse 12 supply “say,” in italics,t [Note: See\nunder Ellipsis (page 33).] corresponding with “whose\nmouth” in verse 8.\n\nThen we have, in the concluding sentence, the true estimate of\nhappiness, and in what it consists, as opposed to the vain and false\nestimate of the strange children:-\n\n“Blessed the people whose God is Jehovah,” as is further set forth\nin Psa. 4:6-7; Psa. 146:5.\n\nThe correspondence, here, corrects the common and popular\ninterpretation of this Psalm, and rescues it for the glory of God.\n\nIt is clear, therefore, from this, that the subject of Correspondence\ncannot be too diligently studied, if we would discover some of the\nwondrous perfections of the Word of God, or arrive at its proper\ninterpretation.\n\nCorrespondence may be thus arranged:\nI. ALTERNATE.\n1. Simple: where there are only two series, each consisting\nof two members.\n2. Extended: where there are two series, but each consisting\nof several members.\n3. Repeated: where there are more than two series:\na. consisting of two members each.\nb. consisting of more than two members each.\nII. INTROVERTED.\nIII.

Hence, to\ncount off, enumerate. The Latins, from this, called it ENUMERATIO,\nwhich has the same meaning.

The adjective or\nthe noun used for it by Enallage (q.v.

An underchange or interchange.\n\nHypallage differs from Antiptosis in that it relates to an interchange\nof construction whereby an adjective or other word, which /ogically\nbelongs to one connexion, is grammatically united with another, so\nthat what is said of or attributed to one thing ought to be said of or\nattributed to the other.\n\nIn the case of two nouns (the latter in regimen), they are\ninterchanged in sense, not as in Antiptosis (where the former\nbecomes an adjective instead of the latter), but they are reversed in\norder or construction without regard to the purely adjectival sense.\n\nShakespeare makes Cassius say of Julius Caesar:\n\n“His coward lips did from their colour fly.”\n\nInstead of “the colour did fly from his coward lips.”\n\nThis interchange attracts attraction to what is said, and thus\nemphasizes the true and real meaning.',''),(109,109,'metonymy','Metonymy; or, Change of Noun\n\nThe Change of one Noun for another Related Noun\n\nMe-ton’-y-my. Sometimes pronounced Met’-o-nym-y. Greek,\nΜετωνυµία, from µετά (meta), indicating change, and ὄνομα (onoma),\na name; or, in grammar, a noun.\nMetonymy is a figure by which one name or noun is used instead\nof another, to which it stands in a certain relation.\n\nThe change is in the noun, and only in a verb as connected with\nthe action proceeding from it.\n\nThe names of persons are put by Metonymy for something which\nstands in a special relation to them. Thus we speak of “a stanhope”\n(carriage), from the Hon. Mr. Stanhope; “a brougham,” from Lord\nBrougham; “boycotting,” from Capt. Boycott; a “blanket,” “negus,” a\n“spencer,” a “d’oyley,” etc., from the respective inventors.\n\nThus it will be seen that Metonymy is not founded on resemblance,\nbut on relation.\n\nWhen we say that a person writes “a bad hand,” we do not mean a\nhand, but we use the noun “hand” for the characters which it writes.\n\nMetonymy is of four kinds: viz., of the Cause, of the Effect, of the\nSubject, and of the Adjunct.\n\nI. Metonymy of the Cause is when the cause is put for the effect:\ni.e., when the doer is put for the thing done; or, the instrument for that\nwhich is effected; or, where the action is put for the effect produced by\nthe action.\n\nII. Metonymy of the Effect is the opposite of the above: when the\neffect is put for the cause.\n\nIII. Metonymy of the Subject is when the subject is put for\nsomething pertaining to it: as the possessor for the possessed; the\nthing signified for the sign.\n\nIV. Metonymy of the Adjunct, on the contrary, is when that which\npertains to anything is put for the thing itself.\n\nSome grammarians have added a fifth Metonymy, where the\nantecedent is put for the consequent; but it really belongs to\nMetonymy of the Cause.\n\nThe following is the complete outline of the figure now to be\ntreated of:-\n\nMETONYMY\nI. OF THE CAUSE.\ni. The person acting for the thing done.\nii. The instrument for the thing effected.\niii. The thing or action for the thing produced by it.\niv.

Hence Metalepsis is a\ndouble or compound Metonymy, or a Metonymy in two stages, only\none of which is expressed.\n\nThus, for example, when we say that a man “drank his house,” we\ndo not mean that he drank the building of bricks and mortar with its\ncontents, but we first use the word “house,” and put it by Metonymy for\nthe money it fetched when sold, and then, by a second Metonymy, the\n“money” is put for the drink it purchased, which was what the man\nactually drank.\n\nSo Virgil (Buc. Ecl i. 70) speaks of Meliboeus returning to hit home\n“after some ears of corn,” where the “ears of corn” are first put (by\nMetonymy of Subject) for the harvest-time, and then the harvest-time\nis put mentally (by Metonymy of Adjunct) for a years So that what\nMeliboeus means is that he will return after some years.\n\nThe Latins called the figure TRANSUMPTIO: i.e., a taking across from\none to another.

The difference\nbetween Metonymy and Synecdoché lies in this; that in Metonymy, the\nexchange is made between two related nouns; while in Synecdoché,\nthe exchange is made between two associated ideas.\n\nSynecdoché of the Genus is where the genus is put for a species.\nSynecdoché of the Species is where a species is put for the\ngenus.\nSynecdoché of the Whole is where the whole is put for a part: and\nSynecdoché of the Part is where a part is put for the whole.\nThese four divisions may be further described and set forth as\nfollows:\n\nI.

Lit, one by means of two. Two words employed, but only\none thing, or idea, intended. One of the two words expresses the\nthing, and the other (of synonymous, or even different, signification,\nnot a second thing or idea) intensifies it by being changed (if a noun)\ninto an adjective of the superlative degree, which is, by this means,\nmade especially emphatic.\n\nThe figure is truly oriental, and exceedingly picturesque. It is found\nin Latin as well as in Hebrew and Greek, and is very frequently used in\nboth Old and New Testaments.\n\nThe two words are of the same parts of speech: i.e., two nouns (or\ntwo verbs) always joined together by the conjunction “and.” The two\nnouns are always in the same case.\n\nAn example or two from the Latin will serve to explain the true\nnature of this figure, which is one of the most important in the Bible.\nTacitus (Ann. i. 49. 5) says, “ultio et satietas,” ΙΗ., a revenge and a\nsufficiency. Here we have not two things, but only one, though there\nare two words. The latter noun becomes a very strong adjective,\nwhich may be well and excellently expressed by our English idiom: “a\nrevenge, yes-and a sufficient revenge too”: i.e., a sufficient revenge,\nwith strong emphasis on the word “sufficient,” from its being thus\nchanged from a noun to an adjective of superlative degree. Had the\nmere adjective been used, the emphasis would then have been on\n“revenge,” thus naturally qualified.\n\nTacitus, again (Ann. i. 61), speaks of one who was slain, “infelici\ndextera et suo ictu,” by his hapless right hand, and his own blow: {6.,\n“by his hapless right hand, yes-a blow dealt by his own hand too.”\n\nTacitus (Ann. ii. 82. end): “tempore et spatio,” time and space.\nHere we have not two things, but one: i.e., “time, yes-and a long-\nextended time too.”\n\nTacitus (Ann. iii. 65. 1): “posteritate et infamia,” posterity and\ninfamy: i.e., “posterity, yes-and an infamous posterity too.”\n\nVirgil (Aen. vii. 15): “gemitus iraeque,” roars and angers: i.e.,\n“roars, yes-and angry roars too.”\nVirgil (Aen. vii. 772): “medicinae et artis,” medicine and art, or\nhealing and skill: i.e., “healing, yes-and skilful healing too,” or skill (and\ngreat skill too) in healing.\n\nHorace (Od. i. 35. 33): “cicatricum et sceleris ... fratrumque,” scars\nand crime and brothers: i.e., “scars and crime (i.e., criminal scars),\nyes-and criminal scars inflicted by brethren too.” This is a case of\nHendiatris (see below).\nCeesar (b. ο. iv. 18): “vi et armis,” by force and arms: i.e., “by force,\nyes-and armed force too.”\n\nMany more examples could be given of this figure which is so\ncommonly used in Latin.\n\nThe Greek Classics also abound in examples:\n\nSophocles (Ajax 145): βοτὰ καὶ λείαν (bota kai leian), cattle and\nplunder: i.e., “cattle, yes-and plundered cattle too.”\n\nHendiadys always raises the qualifying word to the superlative\ndegree.\n\nBut we are not to suppose that whenever we find two words joined\ntogether by the word “and” we have the figure of Hendiadys. It may be\nEpitheton.\n\nIt does not follow that in every case where two nouns are thus\njoined we have only one idea. In the first place, there must be\nsomething to attract our attention, something out of the ordinary\nusage, and sometimes not strictly according to the /etter.\n\nAnd occasionally, even in an undoubted Hendiadys, the two words\nmay be equally true when taken separately and severally, as when\njoined together in one. In these cases both letter and figure arecorrect,\nand the passage gains considerable additional light and force.\n\nAnother point to be remembered is that the two words must have a\ncertain relation to each other: one must indicate a property of the\nother, or be associated in some way with it.\n\nThere cannot be a Hendiadys where the two words are opposed in\nany way in their signification; nor even when there is no real\nconnection between them.\n\nFor example: Php. 1:25, “I know that | shall abide and continue\nwith you all for your furtherance and joy of faith.” Here, in each case,\nthere are two distinct ideas: the abiding in life, and continuing with the\nPhilippian saints; also, their “furtherance” was one thing, and their\n“joy” another.\n\nOn the other hand, verse 11 may be taken in both ways: “Being\nfilled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto\nthe glory and praise of God.” This may be two things: either, to the\nglory of God, and the praise of God; or it may be only one: “Unto the\npraise, yes-the glorious praise, of God.”\n\nSo Rom. 15:4 : “Whatsoever things were written aforetime were\nwritten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the\nScriptures might have hope.”\n\nHere there are two things, not one, because comforting is not a\nproper qualification of patience.\n\nIn reading this verse, therefore, a pause must be made after the\nword “patience” (which we possess), so as to distinguish it from the\n“comfort” (which the Scriptures give).\n\nIn most cases, the context and the analogy of Scripture will decide\nthe doubt.',''),(113,113,'hendiatris','Hendiatris; or, Three for One\n\nThree words used, but one thing meant\n\nThough the Greeks did not name such a figure, it is clear that it is\nemployed in Scripture. For we sometimes find three nouns instead of\ntwo, and in these cases there are two nouns exalted to the place of\nemphatic adjectives, which are thus raised to equal importance with\nthe subject itself.',''),(114,114,'catachresis','Catachresis; or, Incongruity\n\nOne word changed for another only remotely connected with it\nCat’-a-chree-sis. Greek, κατάχρησις, from καρά (kata), against, and\nχρῆσθαι (chreesthai), to use. Hence, misuse.\n\nCatachresis is a figure by which one word is changed for another,\nand this against or contrary to the ordinary usage and meaning of it.\nThe word that is changed is transferred from its strict and usual\nsignification to another that is only remotely connected with it. Hence\ncalled by the Latins ABUSIO, abuse.\n\nIn Metonymy there is a relation between the two words. In\nSynecdoche there is some association between them. In Hendiadys\nthere is a real connection between them. But in Catachresis all this is\nwanting, and the two words or meanings, though they may have\nbetween them something remotely akin or analagous, yet have no real\nor strict relation; and the connection is often incongruous.\n\nWhen man uses this figure, it may often be from ignorance or\nthrough carelessness, but often with good effect. Attention is\nsometimes arrested by a delightful incongruity, as when Young writes:\n\n“Her voice was but the shadow of a sound”:\nwhere the sense is very forcibly conveyed by changing the ordinary\nusage of the word “shadow.”\n“Sorrow was big at her heart.”\n\nOr when we say that a thing is “beautiful to the ear,” or “melodious to\nthe eye”; or, when we apply the word “sweet” to things other than\narticles of food which we taste.\n\nBut, when the Holy Spirit uses this figure, it is in order to arrest us;\nand to attract our attention, by the apparent incongruity, and thus fix it\non what He says.\n\nSometimes the translators introduce a Catachresis, where there is\nnone in the Original: e.g., in Exo. 38:8, they say: “Moses made the\nlaver of brass, and the foot of it of brass out of the looking-glasses of\nthe women.” (But see margin.) The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] avoids this by rendering the word correctly “mirrors.”\n\nThe figure does not mislead; it merely acts as spice or condiment\ndoes to food.\n\nCatachresis is of three kinds:-\n\ni. Of two words, where the meanings are remotely akin.\nii. Of two words, where the meanings are different.\niii. Of one word, where the Greek receives its real meaning by\npermutation from the Hebrew, or some other language, or\nforeign usage.',''),(115,115,'metallage','Metallage; or, a Changing Over\n\nA different subject of thought substituted for the original subject\nMe-tal’-la-gee. Greek µεταλλαγή, from µετά (meta), beyond, or across;\nand ἀλλαγή (allagee), a change, exchange (from ἀλλάσσω, allasso).\nHence, Metallage means a taking over in exchange.\n\nIn this figure the word taken over is exchanged for a separate\nobject of thought.\n\nThe Latins called it SUPPOSITIO, substitution, and MATERIALIS,\nthe mother stuff: i.e., one material out of which something else is\nmade. The figure Metallage is used when a word is taken as the\nmaterial, and out of it another object of thought is made and\nsubstituted.',''),(116,116,'antonomasia','Antonomasia; or, Name-Change\n\nChange of proper name for appellative; or vice versa\n\nАп -to-no-mer-si-a. Greek, ἀντονομασία, a different name, from\nἀντονομάζειν, to name instead; and this from ἀντί (anti), instead, and\nἀνομάζειν (onomazein), to name (from ὄνομα (onoma), a name).\nThis figure is so called because a proper name is put for a\ncommon or appellative noun; or because, on the contrary, an\nappellation derived from some attribute is put for a proper name. As\nwhen a name of some office, dignity, profession, science, or trade, is\nused instead of the proper name of the person: e.g., when we speak\nof the Queen as Her Majesty, or of a nobleman as his lordship; or\nwhen a wise man is called a Solon, or a Solomon, etc.\n\nWhen we speak of David as “the Psalmist,” or of Paul as “the\nApostle,” we use the figure Antonomasia.',''),(117,117,'euphemismos','Euphemismos; or, Euphemy\n\nChange of what is unpleasant for pleasant\n\nEu’-phee-mis’-mos. Greek, αὐφημισμός, from  εὐφημίζειν\n(euphemizein), to use words of good omen, from Е0 (eu), well, and\nφημί (pheemi), to speak Hence, Eng., Euphemy.\n\nEuphemy is a figure by which a harsh or disagreeable expression\nis changed for a pleasant and agreeable one; or, where an offensive\nword or expression is changed for a gentle one; or an indelicate word\nfor a modest word.\nThis figure is not, strange to say, generally used as with us of the\nordinary functions of nature, which are often exaggerated by\ncivilization and fashion into a false modesty. The Scriptures use very\nplain language on plain subjects: but there are beautiful Euphemies\nused where really delicate feelings or sentiments are affected.\n\nIndeed, we may say that the contrast between the Hebrew and\nother languages in this respect is one of the greatest proofs of\nInspiration. Other languages abound in terms of indecency and\nimmorality, which are a corrupt reflex of the corrupt mind of fallen man.\nBut “the words of Jehovah are pure words.”\n\nAs to our “uncomely parts,” as the Holy Spirit terms them, there is\nactually no word in the Hebrew for the female, and for the male a\nEuphemy is employed.\n\nWe may contrast with this the tendency of man, not only downward\nin this direction, but in his vain attempts to cover his sin and to make\nhimself appear better than he is. Examples abound in every day life.\n“A love-child” covers illegitimacy; “a free life” glosses a debauchee; “a\ngentleman of the road” covered a highway robber. So the Romans\ncalled a thief “a man of three letters,” because the Latin word for thief\nis “fur.” On the other hand, among ourselves, “the hydraulic van” has\nsuperseded the water-cart; the shop has become an “establishment”\nor “emporium”; the butcher has blossomed into “a purveyor of meat”;\nthe hair-dresser is “an artist” or “professor,” etc., etc.\n\nBut the Euphemisms of the Bible are not like these! Sin is not\nglossed over or “wrapped up,” but spoken of plainly in all its\nabomination. Man is not deceived by coloured and pretty ornaments of\nspeech.\nCompare, again, man’s Euphemies of “life” and “death”; and note\nthe false teaching conveyed by them, when compared with those used\nin the word of God. Man calls “death” a friend, and speaks of “joining\nthe majority’: but God speaks of it as a terrible calamity, and calls it\n“the enemy’; “the last enemy,” “the king of terrors,” etc., though, in the\ncase of His own people, He speaks of their being “put to sleep by\nJesus” (1Th. 4:14). It is only a “sleep”; because the Lord Himself will\ncome to wake them.\n\nThe change in Euphemy is necessarily obtained by using several\nwords for one, and is therefore a special kind of Periphrasis: i.e., a\nPeriphrasis used with a special object.\n\nHence it was called also PERIPLOCE (Per-i-plok’-ee), from περί\n(peri), around, and πλοκή (plokee), a folding; a figure by which the\nunpleasantness of a thing is wrapped round and made to appear\nagreeable.\n\nCHROMA (Chro’-ma) was another name given to the figure, from\nχρῶμα (chrapma), a colouring, an ornament, or embellishment.\n\nThe Latins called it also INVOLUTIO: i.e., an involution.\n\nIn English we might call it “a smooth handle”: i.e., a polite\nexpression for a rough or unpleasant one.',''),(118,118,'ampliatio','Ampliatio; or, Adjournment: i.е., an Old Name for a New Thing\n\nA retaining of an old Name after the reason for it is passed away\nAm -pli-a’-ti-o is a figure discovered and named by the Latins. It is\nfrom am’-pli-o, to fill out, extend; hence, its more special and technical\nsense, fo adjourn: i.e., to extend the time. So that Ampliatio means an\nadjournment: and the name is given to this figure, because a name or\nepithet is used of a subject either (1) before it has acquired the reason\nfor giving the name, or (2) after the reason has ceased.\n\nIn the latter case “the wolf’ is still spoken of as the wolf in\nMillennial days, when its wolf\'s nature has been changed (Isa. 11:6):\nand in the former the Saviour is so called by the angels while still an\ninfant (Luk. 2:11). This use of the figure is of the nature of Prolepsis\n(q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).\n\nAmopliatio thus differs from Amplificatio (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ),\nthough the two words are from the same root. The former has\nreference to a change which has taken place; while in Amplificatio the\nsense of a word or expression is made wider and expanded by a\nrepetition of the words in another form, in order to enlarge a narrative,\nand to heighten or intensify what has already been said.\n\nAmpliatio is thus a form of Epitheton (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ). The\noriginal meaning of the figure is what is called permansive: i.e., the\nname lives through the change which has taken place, and is still\nused, though in a new sense.\n\nThere is a form of Prolepsis which is distinguished from Ampliatio,\n(as opposed to Occupatio), but only as to time. It is a statement of\nfuture things as though present, the real interpretation of them being\nadjourned.\n\nSee under Prolepsis § 4 and § 6 of the last subdivision of Figures\ninvolving Change.',''),(119,119,'antiphrasis','Antiphrasis; or, Permutation: i.e., A New Name for the Old Thing\n\nA new and opposite Name for a thing after the original Meaning has\nceased.\n\nAn-tiph’-ra-sis. Greek, ἀνήφρασις, from ἀντιφράζειν (antiphrazein), to\nexpress by antithesis or negation; from @мт (anti), against, and\nφράζειν (phrazein). Hence, φράσις (phrasis), a way of speaking. The\nfigure is so called, because a word or phrase is used in a sense\nopposite to its original and proper signification; the figure is thus one\nof change: the name of a thing or subject being changed to the\nopposite, in order to emphasize some important fact or circumstance,\nas when a court of justice was once called “a court of vengeance.”\n\nIt thus partakes of, and is indeed a species of, /rony (α.ν. [Note:\nWhich see.] ). The difference is that Antiphrasis is used only of single\nwords or phrases, while /rony is used of connected sentences.\nAnother difference is that Antiphrasis affects rather the meaning of\nwords, while /rony affects the application of words.\n\nHence Antiphrasis is called, by the Latins, PERMUTATIO, or\npermutation, because of this change of meaning.',''),(120,120,'hyperbaton','Hyperbaton; or, Transposition\n\nThe placing of a Word out of its usual order in a Sentence\n\nHy-per’-ba-ton. Greek, 20е( from 22 (hyper), over, and 5 στ.\n(bainein), to step. Hence =)®!\'! and Hyperbaton, a stepping over,\ntransposition.\n\nThe figure is so called because the words of a sentence are put\nout of their natural and usual grammatical order.\n\nAll words are arranged in a sentence according to certain laws,\nwhich have been acquired by usage. These laws are not the same in\nall languages, but each language has its own peculiar laws, called\nSyntax, which merely means a putting together in order. Even in one\nlanguage this order may vary in different stages of its history and\ndevelopment.\n\nHyperbaton is a putting together of words in a way contrary to or\ndifferent from the usual order. Hence, what is Hyperbaton in one\nlanguage may not be Hyperbaton in another.\n\nIn English, the arrangement of words in a sentence usually follows\nthe order of thought. Hence, naturally, the subject (with all that\npertains to it) comes first: i.e., the thing spoken of; then follows the\ncopula: i.e., the verb, and all words connected with it; and then the\npredicate: i.e., something said about the subject, called the object,\nwith its adjuncts.\nIn an inflected langnage (like the Greek, for example) it is not so\nnecessary to keep to the formal arrangement of the words in a\nsentence, the grammatical dependence of words being sufficiently\nindicated by the inflections. Consequently there is great room for a\nvariety of arrangements, when a particular word has to be\nemphasized.\n\nIt is hopeless to attempt to give an adequate idea of the nature\nand extent of the beautiful and subtle shades of meaning and thought\nproduced by these unusual collocation of words called Hyperbaton. So\ndelicate are they, at times, that it is scarcely possible to reproduce\nthem in a translation.\n\nIn the Greek language, the object usually follows the governing\nverb; but it sometimes comes before it. The predicate usually comes\nafter the object; but sometimes it stands first. The adjective usually\nfollows the noun which it qualifies; but sometimes it stands before its\nnoun: etc, etc.\n\nThe most emphatic position for these transposed words is at the\nbeginning of a clause; but sometimes it is at the end; in which case\nthe word is held back, and kept in suspense, while the attention is kept\nup, and the hearer or reader has nothing for it but to listen to the close\nfor fear of losing the whole. When it is put out of its place, and stands\nout at the beginning, it thrusts itself upon our notice, and compels us\nto give all our attention, and see what it is that is going to be said\nabout it.\nIn the old Hebrew Syntax, the subject usually precedes the\npredicate, the adjective the substantive, pronouns the nouns, the\ngenitive the nominative, and the nominative the verb: e.g., Jdg. 1:7:\n“seventy kings thumbs of their hands and feet cut off, were.”\n\nIn more modern Hebrew Syntax, the adjective follows the\nsubstantive; pronouns follow nouns; while the genitive follows the\nnominative which has a special form called the “construct.”\n\nIn Chaldee, the verb is placed after the subject, and the article\nafter the noun.\nIt has been said that “proper words in proper places is the true\ndefinition of style.” But an intentional deviation from the ordinary “style”\nfor the purpose of attracting attention and expressing the emphasis is\nthe definition of Hyperbaton.\n\nWe may illustrate its use in this way. A person has a particular\nchair in his room, which he wishes his friends to notice. They continue\nto call, but do not notice it. It is in the usual place where chairs ought\nto be, and so does not attract any special attention. But one day he\nplaces this chair upon the table. Who can then fail to observe it, the\nmoment the room is entered?\n\nThis is exactly what takes place with words, in the figure\nHyperbaton. Special attention is desired for some particular word.\nPlaced in its ordinary and usual position, it may not be noticed. But,\nput out of its usual order and place at the beginning instead of at the\nend of a sentence, it is impossible for the reader not to be arrested by\nit.\n\nIf we say, for example, “The mystery of godliness is great,” that is\nthe natural order of the English words. But if we say, “Great is the\nmystery of godliness,” we see at once that all the emphasis is to be\nplaced on the word “great.”\n\nThis figure has also been called SYNCHYSIS, Syn-chy-sis:\nGreek, [© !, from {Je 55 (synchein), to mix up, which is from К\n(sun), together, and =\" (chein), to pour. Hence, \' (chysis), a\npouring, and Synchysis, a mixing up, as of words in a sentence.',''),(121,121,'anastrophe','Anastrophe; or, Arraignment\n\nThe position of One word changed so as to be set over against the\nOther\n\nA-nas’-tro-phee. Greek, > (/!)!\\=, from ©\' = (ana), back again, and Г›\n5\'\' (strephein), to turn, a turning back.\n\nThe figure is so-called because one word is turned, or turned back\nout of its proper or usual position in a sentence.\n\nHence it is a kind of Hyperbaton; but affecting only one word,\ninstead of several words, in a sentence.\n\nIt is called also PARALLAGE, Par-al’-la-gee. Greek, ©0\\\\°>, from\nους ΤΠ] (parallasso), to make things alternate. Hence Parallage\nmeans a deviation, a turning aside, variation. And\nSYNCATEGOREMA, syn-cat’-ee-gor-ee-ma, from \'” (syn), together\nwith, and (| ©) an arraignment. Hence the figure is so called\nbecause one word is set over against or arraigned against another.\nReversal would be a good English name for this figure.\n\nThe Latins called it TRAJECTIO: i.e., a crossing over, a\ntransposition or trajection of words. And INVERSIO, a turning about,\nan inversion of words.\n\nThe word thus put out of its usual place receives great emphasis.\n\nWe have many examples in English:-\n\nThe Verb before its Noun.\n“Burns Marmion’s swarthy cheek like fire.”-Scoit-\n\nAdjective after its Noun.\n\n“He ceased; and death involved him dark around.”-Cowper.\n\nObjective before the Verb.\n\n“Me didst thou constitute a priest of thine.”-Wordsworth\n\nPreposition before the Participle.\n\n“Into what pit thou seest, from what height fallen.”-Milton.\n\nPreposition after the Noun.\n\n“It only stands our lives upon, to use\nOur strongest hands.”-Shakespeare-\n\nNoun at end of sentence.\n“Ape-born, not God-born, is what the atheists say of-man.”',''),(122,122,'syllepsis','Syllepsis; or, Change in Concord\n\nGrammatical Syllepsis, by which there is a change in the Ideas rather\nthan in actual words, so that the concord is logical rather than\ngrammatical\n\nSyl-lep‘-sis.

But it differs from Enallage, in that\nthe change takes place rather in the idea than in the actual words.\nIt is a kind of Zeugma, in that one adjective or verb belonging to\ntwo or more nouns of different genders, persons, or numbers, agrees\nwith one rather than with another.\n\nSyllepsis therefore depends on a change or disturbance in the\nconcord of parts of speech; in making a /ogica/ rather than a\ngrammatical concord.',''),(123,123,'tmesis','Tmesis; or, Mid-cut\n\nA Change by which one Word is cut in two, and another Wordput in\nbetween\n\nTm??-sis.

For example:\n\n“When our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves we leave them.”\n\n“Curved is the line of beauty,\nStraight is the line of duty.”\n\n“The prodigal robs his heir, the miser robs himself.”\n\n“God demands man’s homage; man offers Him his\npatronage.”t [Note: Dr. Robert Anderson in The Silence of God.]\n\nMan often misuses this figure, for the mere fancy of balancing\nsentences; and thus often falsely exaggerates a contrast which lies\nmore in the words than in the thoughts. When this is the case it is\ncalled Antimetabole, Parison, Annominatio, etc. (q.v.

In this case, of course, what is abandoned\nis not further necessary. It has served its purpose in arresting, and so\nthe argument passes on to that to which the attention is to be given.',''),(131,131,'simile','Simile; or, Resemblance\n\nA Declaration that one Thing resembles another; or, Comparison by\nResemblance\n\nSim’-i-le. This is the Latin name of the figure; from similis, like, similar,\nresembling closely, or in many respects.\n\nThis figure has no corresponding Greek name. Indeed it can\nhardly be called a figure, or an unusual form of expression, seeing it is\nquite literal, and one of the commonest forms of expression in use. It\nis a cold, clear, plain statement as to a resemblance between words\nand things. The whole application of the figure lies in this\nResemblance, and not in Representation, as in Metonymy; or in\nImplication, as in Hypocatastasis; or, in Association, as in\nSynecdoche.\n\nAccordingly, when this resemblance is not apparent, or is counter\nto our ordinary perception of things, it jars upon the ear. Such Similes\nabound in human writings. Hence the pleasure of studying the use of\nthem in the Word of God, where we have the Holy Spirit’s own perfect\nwork.\nMany examples could be given of false, or incongruous Similes in\nhuman writings. Take, for example, Montgomery’s poem on Satan:*\n[Note: Quoted in Macbeth’s Might and Mirth of Literature.]\n\n“Lo! the bright dew-bead on the bramble lies,\nLike liquid rapture upon Beauty’s eyes.”\n\nWe fail to see any resemblance between beauteous eyes and a\nbramble; or, any meaning at all in “liquid rapture.”\n\nSo Mrs. Browning:\n\n“Then the bitter sea\n\nInexorably pushed between us both;\n\nAnd sweeping up the steep with my despair,\nThrew us out as a pasture to the stars.”\n\nWe fail to see any resemblance between a ship and a pasture; and\nwhy stars go out to grass; or, when they do, why they should feed on\nships and their passengers!\n\nNo such inexplicable similes as these can be found in the\nScriptures.\n\nWhen one is used there, it is “for our learning;” and the more we\nstudy it the more we may learn.\n\nThey are usually marked by the Caph (2) in Hebrew; and in the\nGreek by ὡς (hds), as; καθώς (kathés), like as; or, by some seventeen\nother kindred words* [Note: See under the word “AS” in A Critical\nLexicon and Concordance, by the same author. Longman and Co 15\n5.1: and the English: “as,” “like as,” “even as,” “like,” etc.\n\nSimile differs from Comparison, in that comparison admits of dis-\nsimilitudes as well as resemblances.\n\nSimile differs from Allegory (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ) in that\nallegory names only one of the two things and leaves us to find, and\nmake the resemblance with the other, ourselves.\n\nSimile differs from Metaphor (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ), in that it\nmerely states resemblance, while Metaphor boldly transfers the\nrepresentation.\n\nSimile differs from Hypocatastasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), in that\nthe latter only implies the resemblance, while Simile states it.\nSimile, therefore, is destitute of feeling. It is clear, beautiful, gentle,\ntrue to fact, but cold and too deliberate for passion.\n\nAll this will be seen as the Similes are studied. They require no\n\nexplanation. They explain and are intended to explain themselves. It is\nscarcely necessary to give any examples. They abound throughout\nthe Scripture, and impart to it much of its beauty and force.',''),(132,132,'syncrisis','Syncrisis; or, Repeated Simile\n\nRepetition of a number of Resemblances\n\nSyn~-cri-sis. Greek, σύγκρισις, from σύν (sun), together with, and\nκρίσις (crisis), a judging or deciding.\n\nHence, Syncrisis is the judging or comparing of one thing with\nanother; and is used of the figure which consists of a repeated Simile,\nor of more than one, or of a number of separate comparisons used\ntogether.\n\nAnother name for this figure is PARATHESIS (Pa-rath’-e-sis),\nGreek, παράθεσις, a putting beside; from παρά (para), beside, and\nτιθέναι (tithenai), to place.\n\nIt was called by the Latins COMPARATIO: i.e., a bringing together\nand comparing.',''),(133,133,'metaphor','Metaphor; or, Representation\n\nA Declaration that one Thing is (or represents) another; or,\nComparison by Representation\n\nMet’-a-phor. Greek, µεταθορά (metaphora), а transference, or\ncarrying over or across. From µετά (meta), beyond or over, and φέρειν\n(pherein), to carry. We may call the figure “Representation” or\n“Transference.”\n\nHence, while the Simile gently states that one thing is like or\nresembles another, the Metaphor boldly and warmly declares that one\nthing IS the other.\n\nWhile the Simile says “All flesh is AS grass” (1Pe. 1:24), the\nMetaphor carries the figure across at once, and says “All flesh IS\ngrass” (Isa. 40:6). This is the distinction between the two.\n\nThe Metaphor is, therefore, not so true to fact as the Simile, but is\nmuch truer to feeling.\n\nThe Simile says “All we like sheep,” while the Metaphor declares\nthat “we are the sheep of His pasture.”\n\nWhile, therefore, the word “resembles” marks the Simile:\n“represents” is the word that marks the metaphor.\n\nWe have recourse to Metaphor when we say of a picture, “This is\nmy father,” or “This is my mother.” The verb “is” means in this case\nrepresents; there may not be the least resemblance! The verb “is”\nalways has this meaning and no other when used as a metaphor. No\nother verb will do.\n\nFew figures are more misunderstood than the Metaphor. It is one\nof the few whose names are well known, and hence it has become. a\ngeneral term for any figure; and any figurative language is commonly\ncalled “metaphorical.”\n\nFew figures have been more variously defined. But all the\ndifferences of opinion arise from not separating the figure\nHypocatastasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) on the one hand, ог\ndistinguishing Simile on the other. The same confusion is seen with\nreference to Allegory (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\n\nLet it then be clearly understood that a Metaphor is confined to a\ndistinct affirmation that one thing is another thing, owing to some\nassociation or connection in the uses or effects of anything expressed\nor understood. The two nouns themselves must both be mentioned,\nand are always to be taken in their absolutely literal sense, or else no\none can tell what they mean. The figure lies wholly in the verb, or\ncopula, which, in English, must always be expressed, and never\nunderstood by Ellipsis.\n\nFor example, “All flesh is grass.” Here “flesh” is to be taken literally\nas the subject spoken of, and “grass” is to be taken equally literally as\nthat which represents “flesh.” All the figure lies in the verb “is.” This\nstatement is made under strong feeling, the mind realising some point\nof association; but, instead of using the more measured verb\n“resembles,” or “is like”; which would be truer to fact, though not so\ntrue to feeling; the verb “is” is used, and the meaning of one thing is\ncarried across and transferred to the other. It is not, as some might\nthink, a mere Hebrew idiom to use “is” for “represents”; but it is a\nnecessity of language arising from the actual condition and character\nof the human mind.\n\nWe must, therefore, banish the common and loose way in which\nthe words “metaphor” and “metaphorical” are used, and confine the\nfigure strictly and exclusively to this, its one true and proper\nsignification: that of representation.\nThe Representation referred to in the figure may not lie upon the\nsurface, and may not be at all apparent in the language itself. It may\nbe in the uses of the thing represented, or in the effects which it\nproduces. In this case the Metaphor often comes as a surprise, by the\ndiscovery of a point in which two apparently unrelated objects have\nsome point in which they really agree. Hence the same thing may be\nused, by a Metaphor, to represent two totally different objects by some\ndifferent quality or character which may be referred to: e.g., a lion is\nused both of Christ and of the devil. We are to “cease from man” as\nopposed to trust in God; we are exhorted to “quit” ourselves like men\nas opposed to all that is effeminate.\n\nThe Latins* [Note: Cicero. Orat. xxvii] called the figure\nTRANSLATIO: i.e., Translation, thus denoting the same fact: viz., the\ntranslation or carrying across of one thing and applying it to another\nwhich represents it, just as what is meant in one language is carried\nacross and expressed or transiated in the words of another language.\n\nIt should be observed that the Hebrew has no verb substantive or\ncopula answering to the Greek and English verb “to be.” Consequently\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] generally puts in italics the verbs “is,” “are,” “were,” etc.\nThe verb “to be,” though it is not necessary to be expressed in\nHebrew, is yet so really there that the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] has abandoned the use of italic type with regard to it\nin the Old Testament, and so the Revisers state it in their preface. We\nprefer the practice of the translators of the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ and believe it is\nmore correct.\n\nIn the Greek, as we shall see below, whenever a Metaphor is\n\nintended, the verb substantative must be used; otherwise it is often\nomitted according to the Hebrew usage (see the Beatitudes, etc.). It is,\ntherefore, more easy to discern a Metaphor in the New Testament\nthan in the Old. In the latter we have to be guided by what is true to\nfact and what is true only to feeling. If we distinguish between these,\nwe shall not fail to see what is a statement of fact, and what is a\nMetaphor.',''),(134,134,'hypocatastasis','Hypocatastasis; or, Implication\n\nA Declaration that implies the Resemblance or Representation; or\nComparison by Implication\n\nHy’-po-cat-as‘-ta-sis. Greek, ὑποκατάστασις, substitution or\nimplication; from ὑπό (hypo), underneath, κατά (kata), down, and\nστάσις (stasis), a stationing. Hence, a putting down underneath.\nAs a figure, it differs from Metaphor, because in a metaphor the\ntwo nouns are both named and given; while, in Hypocatastasis, only\none is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down\nunderneath out of sight. Hence Hypocatastasis is implied resemblance\nor representation: i.e., an implied Simile or Metaphor. ΙΙ Metaphor is\nmore forcible than Simile, then Hypocatastasis is more forcible than\nMetaphor, and expresses as it were the superlative degree of\nresemblance.\n\nFor example, one may say to another, “You are like a beast.” This\nwould be Simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You are a\nbeast” that would be Metaphor. But, if he said simply, “Beast!” that\nwould be Hypocatastasis, for the other part of the Simile or Metaphor\n(“you”), would be implied and not stated.\n\nThis figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract\nand excite the attention to the greatest extent.\n\nSo well known was it to the ancients, that it received this\nsignificant name. But it is, to-day, unmentioned by literary men, though\nit is often unconsciously used by them. Thus, their language is\nenriched by its use, while the figure is unknown, even by name!\n\nWhat a proof of the sad neglect into which this great subject has\nfallen; and what an example of the consequent loss which has\nensued.\n\nThis beautiful and far-reaching figure frequently occurs in\nScripture. The Lord Jesus Himself often used it, and that with\nwondertul effect.\n\nIts beauty and force will be at once seen, if we compare one or two\npassages.',''),(135,135,'allegory','Allegory; or, Continued Metaphor and\nHypocatastasis\n\nContinued Comparison by Representation or Implication\n\nAl’-le-go-ry. Greek, ἀλληγορία, from ἄλλος (allos), another, and\nἀγορεύειν (agoreuein), to speak or make a speech in the agora (i.e.,\nassembly).\n\nFew figures have been the subject of greater controversy than\nAllegory; or, have been more variously defined. One class of\nRhetoricians declare that it is a continued metaphor: and another\nclass declare that it is not. But, as is often the case under such\ncircumstances, neither is quite correct, because both have a part of\nthe truth and put it for the whole. Neither of the contending parties\ntakes into consideration the existence of Hypocatastasis. And this fact\naccounts for the confusion, not only with regard to Allegory, but also\nwith regard to Metaphor.\n\nAll three figures are based on comparison. Simile is comparison by\nresemblance; Metaphor is comparison’ by — representation;\nHypocatastasis is comparison by implication.\n\nIn the first the comparison is stated; in the second it is substituted;\nin the third it is implied.\n\nThus Allegory is a continuation of the latter two, Metaphor or\nHypocatastasis; while the Parable (q.v. [Note: Which see] ) is a\ncontinuation of the Simile.\nThis definition clears the whole ground, and explains the whole of\nthe difficulties, and reconciles the different schools.\nThe Allegory, therefore, is of two kinds; one in which it is continued\n\nMetaphor (as in Psa. 23:1-6), where the two things are both\nmentioned (Jehovah, and the Shepherd’s care), and what is asserted\nbelongs to the principal object; the other, in which it is continued\nHypocatastasis (Psa. 80:8-15), where only one thing is mentioned (the\nvine), and what is asserted belongs properly to the Secondary object;\nviz., to Israel.

Latin, FABULA, a fable.\n\nAn Apologue (or Fable) differs from a Parable, in that the Parable\ndescribes what is likely or probable, or at any rate what is believed by\nthe hearers as probable, while the Fable is not limited by such\nconsiderations, and is used of impossiblities, such as trees, or\nanimals, and inanimate things talking and acting.\n\nThe Fable, therefore, is a fictitious narrative intended to illustrate\nsome maxim or truth.',''),(138,138,'paroemia','Parcemia; or, Proverb\n\nA wayside-saying in common use\n\nPar-oi-mi-a. παροιμία, a way-side; from παρά (para), beside, and\nοἶμος (oimos), a way or path. Hence Parcemia is a way side saying, a\ntrite expression, or common remark, a proverb. As we say “a saw” or\nadage.\n\nLike Parable, Parcemia is used in the Septuagint Version to\ntranslate the Hebrew word 222 (mahshal). Now this noun 222\n(mahshal) belongs to the verb 22? (mahshal), which means to rule,\ncontrol, to have, or exercise control.\n\nHence it is plain that there must be a close connection between “a\nrule” and “a proverb.” This connection may be illustrated by our phrase\n“a ruling principle”; and by the fact that we might term what we call ‘the\nProverbs of Solomon’ ‘Solomon’s Rules’; since that is just what they\nare: rules for guiding life. Indeed, if we ask what is the derivation of the\nword “Maxim,” we may find its history not unlike that of Tapoipia in\nGreek. It would seem to mean ‘a saying most widely used,’ ‘most in\nvogue,’ in the market, by the roadside, and in ordinary life generally.\nBy degrees, usage separated the words Parable and Paroemia; and\nParable was limited to an illustration; while Paroemia was confined to\nwhat we now call a proverb.\n\nThe figure is used, therefore, of any sententious saying, because\nthese are generally such as control and influence life.\n\nThe word Parcemia is used in the New Testament (Joh. 10:6),\nwhere it is rendered “parable”; and in 16:25 (twice), 29, and 2Pe. 2:22,\nwhere it is rendered “Proverb.”\nThe Latin name for the figure is PROVERBIUM, Proverb. Hence,\nthe name given to the book of Proverbs,* [Note: See The Names and\nOrder of the Books of the Old Testament, by the same author and\npublisher. Price fourpence.] which consists of collections of such brief\nsententious sayings which govern the life and control the walk.\n\nParcemice or Proverbs occuring in Scripture may be divided into\nthree classes:-\n\n1. Those that are quoted as being already in use as such.\n\n2. Those which, though not quoted as such, were very probably\nalready in use as proverbial expressions.\n\n3. Those which appear for the first time in Scripture; but which,\nowing to their fulness of meaning and their wide application, have\nsince passed into general use as proverbial sayings.',''),(139,139,'type','Type\n\nA figure or ensample of something future and more or less prophetic,\ncalled the “Antitype”\n\nType. Greek, τύπος (typos). The verb τύπτειν (tuptein), to strike, make\nan impress. Hence Type means primarily a blow; then, the impress or\nmark left by a blow; then, a mark, print, or impress of any kind.\n\nIn the New Testament the word occurs in several of these senses.\n\nIt is rendered:-\n1. Α print or mark (Joh. 20:25).* [Note: The second occurrence\nin this verse is read OU, the place, by Lachmann, Tischendorf,\nTregelles (margin).]\n\n2. Figure (Act. 7:43. Rom. 5:14).\n\n3.

Example (1Co. 10:6. 1Ti. 4:12).\n\nThe Greeks used it of the symptoms of a disease. Galen wrote a\nmedical work entitled περὶ τῶν τύπων, concerning symptoms. In a\nLegal sense it was used of what we technically cite as a “case.”\n\nIt will thus be seen that the special and technical sense which has\nbeen given to it by Theologians is not exactly equivalent to any of\nthese usages: the nearest being Rom. 5:14, where Adam is spoken of\nas a type of the Coming One.\n\nThe theological use of the word agrees more with what in the New\nTestament is called σκιά (skia), a shadow (Heb. 10:1-39 i. Col. 2:17).\n\nThere is, therefore, not much profit in following out what have been\ncalled types by men. Many are merely illustrations; and it would be\nbetter so to call them; inasmuch as they did not and do not of\nthemselves teach the truths, but only illustrate those truths which are\nelsewhere clearly revealed. We should never have called them types\nbut for such subsequent revelation; and therefore they are only\nillustrations so far as their teaching agrees with clear revelation\nafterward made.',''),(140,140,'symbol','Symbol\n\nA material Object substituted for a moral or spiritual Truth\n\nGreek, σύμβολον (symbolon), from σύν (syn), together, and βάλλειν\n(ballein), to cast; hence a casting together. Used by the Greeks, much\nin the same way as we use the word “coupon,” where one part\ncorresponded with or represented another part. Hence, in language,\nthe use of one thing to represent another; or, the use of a material\nobject to represent a moral or spiritual truth.\n\nThe word does not occur in the New Testament, and nothing is\nsaid in Scripture as to one thing being so used. The assertion as to\nanything being a symbol of another rests entirely on human authority,\nand depends for its accuracy on its agreement with the teaching of\nScripture.\n\nThe nearest word to symbol is mystery; and, by the Fathers,\nµυστήριον was used as being synonymous with σύμβολον.\n\nΜυστήριον (mysteerion) means secret; * [Note: See The Mystery,\nby the same author and publisher.] and later it came to mean a secret\nsign or symbol.

A\nGnome is, properly speaking, a quotation: and therefore this figure\nopens up the whole question of the Quotations from the Old\nTestament in the New.\n\nThis is a large subject, many volumes having been written upon it,\nboth in ancient and in recent times.\nIt is also a difficult subject, owing to certain phenomena which lie\nupon its surface.\n\nIt is a fact that there are variations between the quotations and the\nText quoted from.\n\nSometimes they agree with the Septuagint translation, and differ\nfrom the Hebrew, and vice versa; and sometimes they differ from both.\n\nSometimes they are direct quotations; at other times they are\ncomposite quotations of several passages joined in one; while others\nare mere allusions.\n\nConsequently it is difficult for anyone to make a list or table of such\nquotations which shall agree with those made by others.\nThe general fact seems to be that there are 189 separate\npassages quoted* [Note: If it is merely a reference or allusion, as\ndistinct from a quotation, then there are many more, of course. The\nLord Jesus Himself referred to 22 out of our 39 Old Testament books.\n\nIn Matthew there are references to 88 passages in 10 Old\nTestament books. In Mark to 37 passages in 10 books.

Notice, then, the\nfollowing examples:-\n\nMar. 12:36.-“David himself said by the Holy Ghost.” This was the\nintroduction to a quotation from Psa. 110:1.\n\nMat. 15:4.-Referring to Exo. 20:12, our Lord says, “God commanded,\nsaying,” etc.\nHeb. 3:7.-Referring to Psa. 95:7-11. “Wherefore as the Holy Ghost\nsaith,” not “as David saith,” or “as the Psalmist saith.”\n\nHeb. 9:8.-Referring to Exo. 25:1-40 -х!. (concerning the Tabernacle\nand its teaching), “The Holy Ghost this signifying,” etc.\n\nHeb. 10:15.-Quoting Jer. 31:33-34, “Whereof the Holy Ghost is a\nwitness to us.”\n\nAct. 1:16.-Peter, quoting Psa. 41:9 (10), says, “This Scripture must\nneeds have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of\nDavid, spake before concerning Judas.” Observe, that while David\nspake, the words were not his, but “the words of the Holy Ghost.”\nAct. 3:18.-Peter, referring to the Old Testament prophecies of Christ,\nsays, “Those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all\nhis prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.”\n\nAct. 28:25.-Paul, quoting Isa. 6:9, exclaims, “Well spake the Holy\nGhost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers.\n\nOld Testament passages are introduced in various ways:\n\n1. γέγρατπαι (gegraptai), it standeth written. Mat. 4:4-10. Luk. 4:4;\nLuk. 4:8. Rom. 1:17; Rom. 3:4; Rom. 3:10; Rom. 10:15. 1Co. 1:19;\n1Co. 1:31. 1Pe. 1:16, etc.\n\n2. λέγει γὰρ ἡ γραφή (legei даг hee graphee), for the Scripture\nsaith. Rom. 9:17 (Exo. 9:16). Rom. 10:11 (Isa. 28:16). 1Ti. 5:18 (Deu.\n25:4).\n\n3. 6 νόμος (ho nomos) The Law. Joh. 15:25, from Psa. 35:19; Psa.\n69:4 (5), emphasizes the fact that the Sacred Writings of the Old\nCovenant, viewed as a whole, constituted the Law of Israel. The\npronoun “their” shows this. Joh. 10:34 (from Psa. 82:6) is written in\nExo. 21:6; Exo. 22:8-9 (7, 8). And 1Co. 14:21 (from Isa. 28:11-12) has\na reference to Deu. 28:49. Thus the reference is carried back, not only\nto the passage quoted, but to the one still earlier, in which it had its\norigin.\nIn the New Testament eight men are specified as the agents\nemployed by the Holy Spirit: Moses, 13 times; David 7; Elijah, once;\nIsa. 12:1-6; Joel, once; Hosea, once; Jeremiah, twice; Daniel, once.\n\nIn Matthew an agent is named 13 times (Jeremiah, Isaiah, Moses,\nDavid, and Daniel).\n\nIn Mar. 7:1-37 (Moses, Isaiah, David, Daniel).\n\nIn Luk. 6:1-49 (Moses, Isaiah, David).\n\nIn Joh. 4:1-54 (Isaiah, Moses).\n\nIn Act. 10:1-48 (David, Joel, Moses, Isaiah).\n\nIn Rom. 10:1-21 (David, Hosea, Isaiah, Moses, Elijah).\n\nIn 1 Cor., (Moses) once.\n\nIn Heb. 3:1-19 (David, Moses).\n\nIn Rev., (Moses) once.\n\nThus, 14 passages are ascribed to the agency of Moses; 8 to that\nof David; 13 of Isa. 2:1-22 of Hos. 2:1-23 of Jer. 1:1-19 of Dan. 1:1-21\nof Joe. 1:1-20 of Elijah.\nThese facts are deeply instructive; because, for example, while the\nmodern critics divide the book of Isaiah into two authorships, the New\nTestament ascribes six out of the thirteen passages to Isaiah in the\nfirst part of the prophecy (chaps. 1-39.), and seven out of the last part\n(chaps. 40-46). The recognition of this one simple fact demolishes\ncompletely the hypothesis of the Higher Critics, and will cause us to\nprefer the statements of God to the imagination of men.\n\nIn making a quotation from the Old Testament in the New, surely\nthe Holy Spirit is at liberty to do what any and every human writer may\ndo, and frequently does, in his own works. Human writers and\nspeakers constantly repeat, refer to, and quote what they have\npreviously written and spoken, introducing the words in new senses, in\ndifferent connections, with varied references, and in fresh applications.\n\nThis is the case with the quotations in the Bible, and this one\nconsideration explains all the so-called difficulties connected with the\nsubject.\n\nOur work, then, in considering these differences, becomes totally\ndifferent in character from that which treats them merely as\ndiscrepancies, arising from human infirmity or ignorance. These\ndifferences become all important, because they convey to us Divine\ncomments, and reveal to us new truths.\nIn quoting, or using again, words and expressions which the Holy\nSpirit has before used, we may note the following interesting ways in\nwhich He varies the sense or the words in order to convey to us new\ntruths and lessons by the new application.\nIn referring to these by way of illustration we have not classified\nthem according to these definitions and divisions, as the student can\ndetermine each case for himself. But we have followed the\narrangement of Glassius in his chapter on Gnomes.* [Note: Which\nKeach translates almost verbatim, without any acknowledgment.]\n\nI.

It is not\nsynonymous with what we speak of as ambiguous; which means that\nwhich is uncertain or equivocal.\n\nA statement which is amphibological has two meanings, both of\nwhich are absolutely true. (An equivocation has two meanings also,\nbut only one of them is true.) There are several such statements in\nScripture, and indeed all prophecies are more or less of this character.\nThey are the words of Jehovah, who was, and is, and is to come;\nhence His words have a fulness of reference and meaning which one\ninterpretation often fails to exhaust. A prophecy may have a reference\nto something at the time of its utterance. It may wait for its final\nfulfilment in the remote future. And there may be an application to the\ntime between these two limits. Hence the Futurist and Prrterist\ninterpretations are both true, in so far as they are each a part of the\ntruth.

Hence, a civilian as\nopposed to a military man; a layman, as opposed to a cleric or lawyer;\nan amateur, as opposed to a professional; a prose-writer, as opposed\nto a poet; an ignorant person, as opposed to a learned person.

Whence the Latin name for the figure\nIDIOTISMUS. The English name for it is IDIOM.\n\nThe word is used in three significations:\n\n(1) The language peculiar to the vulgar, as opposed to what is\nclassical.\n\n(2) The language peculiar to one nation or tribe, as opposed to\nother languages or dialects.\n\n(3) The language peculiar to any particular author or speaker.\n\nIt is in the second of these senses that it becomes important as a\nfigure of speech.\n\nThe fact must ever be remembered that, while the language of the\nNew Testament is Greek, the agents and instruments employed by the\nHoly Spirit were Hebrews. God spake “by the mouth of his holy\nprophets.” Hence, while the “mouth” and the throat and vocal-chords\nand breath were human, the words were Divine.\n\nNo one is able to understand the phenomenon; or explain how it\ncomes to pass: for Inspiration is a fact to be believed and received,\nand not a matter to be reasoned about.\n\nWhile therefore, the words are Greek, the thoughts and idioms are\nHebrew.\n\nSome, on this account, have condemned the Greek of the New\nTestament, because it is not classical; while others, in their anxiety to\ndefend it, have endeavoured to find parallel usages in classical Greek\nauthors.\n\nBoth might have spared their pains by recognising that the New\nTestament Greek abounds with Hebraisms: i.e., expressions\nconveying Hebrew usages and thoughts in Greek words.\n\nIt will be seen at once that this is a subject which has a large and\nimportant bearing on the interpretation and clear understanding of\nmany passages in the New Testament.\n\nMuch is said in favour of a literal translation. But in many cases\nthis makes no sense whatever, and would sometimes make\nnonsense. What is wanted is an idiomatic version: i.e., the exact\nreproduction, not of the words, but of the thought and meaning of the\nphrase. It is in this that the difference is seen between the Authorized\nVersion and the Revised. The former is a Version, while the latter is a\ntranslation. Hence the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] is English, while the RV; often is not.\n\nThis refers to words as well as to phrases. To bring the matter\nhome, imagine an Englishman and an American translating from the\nFrench:-Gare, the one would render “Station,” and the other “Depot”:\nWagon de marchandises would be in English “Goods-Truck”; and in\nAmerica, “Freight Car’: Bureau (de billets) would be “Booking Office”\nand “Ticket Office” respectively; En Voiture would be, in English, “Take\nyour seats”: and in America, “All abroad.”\n\nFancy rendering Mont de pi\'t\', literally mountain of piety, instead of\n“pawn-shop”! or Commissionaire de pi\'t\', literally Commissionaire of\nPiety, instead of “Pawnbroker”! or Faire des chateux en Espagne,\nliterally to make castles in Spain instead of “to build castles in the air”!\nOr Tomber dans Геаи, literally to fall into the water, instead of “to\nfall to the ground,” or more colloquially “to fall through”!\n\nOn the other hand, what would a Frenchman understand if “How\ndo you do?” were rendered literally, instead of idiomatically: “How do\nyou carry yourself,”* [Note: Or the German: How goes it? wie gehts?]\nor “the water of life,” Eau de vie! instead of “Eau vive.”\n\nAll this makes it perfectly clear that, unless the translation be\nidiomatic, there must be grave mistakes made; and that, if a\ntranslation be absolutely literal, it will be a fruitful source of errors.\n\nThe importance of this fact can hardly be over-rated; and,\nconsidering the way in which many talk of, and insist on, a “literal”\ntranslation, it is necessary to press the point and enforce it by\nexamples from the Scriptures.\n\nIdiom, however, is not generally classed among Figures in the\ntechnical sense of the word. But, as the words do not mean literally\nwhat they say, and are not used or combined according to their literal\nsignification, they are really Figures; and we have, therefore, included\nthem here.\n\nWe will consider them under the following divisions: giving only a\nfew examples under each by way of illustration:-\nI. Idiomatic usage of Verbs.\nII. Special idiomatic usages of Nouns and Verbs.\nIII. Idiomatic Degrees of Comparison.\nIV. Idiomatic use of Prepositions.\nV. Idiomatic use of Numerals.\nVI.

FICTIO, the\nmaking or feigning of a person. Also CONFORMATIO, a conforming or\nfashioning, delineation, conception.\n\nThe figure of Personification may be divided into the following six\nclasses or groups:-\n\nI.

SYNCATABASIS (Syn-cat-\nab’-a-sis), from σύν (syn), together with, κατά (kata), down, and\nβαΐνειν (bainein), to go: a going down together with: i.e., God, by using\nthis figure, condescends to the ignorance and infirmity of man.\n\nHence, the Latin name for it was CONDESCENSIO,\ncondescension.\n\nThe following are the divisions in which the various uses of this\nfigure may be presented:-\n\nI.

It is\na sudden breaking off in the course of speech, diverting it to some\nnew person or thing.\n\nIt is called also PROSPHONESIS (προσφώνησις, pros-ph6-neeo-\nsis), an addressing one’s self to: from πρός (pros), to, and φωνεῖν\n(ph nein), to speak.\n\nAlso by the Latins, AVERSIO, aversion, or a turning from.\n\nThe examples of the use of this figure may be arranged as\nfollows:-\n\nAPOSTROPHE Addressed\n\nI.

Sometimes this digression is mentioned, and a promise given to\nreturn to it again.\nThe figure was hence called by the Latins DIGRESSIO, or\ndigression, and was known by other names among the Greeks:-\n\nPARABASIS (par-ab’-a-sis), from the above roots, a stepping\naside.\n\nECBOLE. Greek, ἐκβολή (ec’-bo-lee), a throwing out, from ἐκ (ek),\nout, and βάλλειν (ballein), to throw: hence, a digression in which a\nperson is introduced speaking (or throwing out) his own words.\n\nAPHODOS. Greek, ἄφοδος (aph-od’-os), a going away from, from\nἀπό (apo), away from, and ὅδος (hodos), a way.\n\nThe nature of this figure therefore is clear; and examples are not\nwanting in Scripture.\n\nIt is more than a mere Parenthesis (q.v.

Greek, ἐπανόρθωσις, from ἐπί (epi), upon, ava\n(ana), up or again, and ὀρθοῦν (orthoun), to set straight (from ὀρθός\n(orthos), straight).\nHence Epanorthosis means a setting upright again.\nThe figure is so called when a writer or speaker has said\nsomething, and immediately recalls it in order to substitute something\nbetter, or stronger, or weightier, in its place, thus correcting what has\nbeen said. Hence the Latins called this figure CORRECTIO,\ncorrection.\n\nThe Greeks had other names for it, owing to its beauty and power,\nand also to the frequency of its employment. They called it\n\nDIORTHOSIS (di-or-thé‘-sis), from διά (dia), through, and ὀρθοῦν.\n(orthoun), to set straight.\n\nEPIDIORTHOSIS (ep ‘-i-di-or-th6‘-sis).

So that the correction is on both sides. When\nthis, or rather a similar figure, is used in Argumentation, it is called\nProdiorthosis; and in Prodiorthosis it is not so much are calling, so that\nthere may be no shock at all (as in Amphidiorthosis), but a preparing\nfor a shock that does actually come.\n\nSome have confounded these two figures, but this is the distinction\nbetween them.',''),(158,158,'anachoresis','Anachoresis; or, Regression\n\nA Return to the Original Subject after a Digression\n\nAn-a-cho’-ree-sis.

Then it was used of a song of deliverance, or\nof triumph after victory, and even before it, as a war-song.

In this character, they tell us, “he cures the wounded\nHades and Ares” (see Hom. ΙΙ. 5:401 and 899). From him, it seems,\nthe name came to be applied to human physicians. After Homer, L.\nand S. tell us, “the name and office of healing were transferred to\nApollo.” And from his son, Esculapius (Asclepius, in its more Greek\nform), physicians got another of their titles. So, then, dé meant a\nchoral song, of which the main burden was 13 (contracted from Р\napparently, which would seem to be connected with НОх, 21 heal?) ог\ni, 99933, sung in commemoration of deliverance from some evil-[a\npestilence, perhaps, originally]-and hence a song of triumph generally.\nSuch a song would be sung before as well as after battle.

A marking by putting a\nstar (* or ), in order to direct particular attention to a passage or\nstatement. Hence the figure is used when we employ (not an asterisk)\nbut some word, which answers the same purpose, in directing the eye\nand the heart to some particular point or subject, such as “Lo!”\n“Behold!”\n\nAs a concordance will furnish a complete list of these, it is not\nnecessary for us to give examples. We will only note that the word\n“behold” is not a mere interjection, but is really a verb, telling us\nactually to look and see, and observe and note attentively.\n\n“Behold” seems to be specially the word used by the Holy Spirit\nas the Inspirer of Scripture: while “Verily” (amen) is the word used by\nthe Lord Jesus; and “Yea” is the word of God the Father.',''),(170,170,'ecphonesis','Ecphonesis; or, Exclamation\n\nAn Expression of Feeling by way of Exclamation\n\nEc’-phé-nee’-sis.

This is the Latin name, and means denunciation,\ncursing, imprecation, or execration.\n\nHence the other Latin names, IMPRECATIO and EXECRATIO,\nCOMMINATIO. Also ARA, an altar, by which, and at which, oaths and\nexecrations were pronounced.\n\nThe Greeks called it APEUCHE, ap-eu-chee, from ἀπεύχομαι, to\npray a thing away, to pray that a thing may not be, and MISOS, mi-\nsos, Greek µῖσος, hate, hatred, a hateful object or thing.',''),(181,181,'deasis','Deasis; or, Adjuration\n\nAn Expression of Feeling by Oath or Asseveration\n\nDe’-a-sis, from Greek, δέησις, an entresting, obtestation, or calling to\nwitness.\nThe Latins called it OBSECRATIO, a beseeching, imploring, and\nOBTESTATIO, an adjuring, or calling of God to witness.\n\nThe figure is used when the speaker or writer calls God or heaven\nto witness to the truth of what is said, or to the facts which he states.\nApart from this calling to witness, the figure is of the nature of\nApostrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).',''),(182,182,'chleuasmos','Chleuasmos; or, Mocking\n\nAn Expression of Feeling by Mocking and Jeering\n\nChleu-as’-mos. Greek, Χλευασμµός, mocking, scoffing, sneering,\nJeering, from Χλεύη (chleuee), a jest, and χλευάζω (chleuaz6), to make\na jest of, scoff at.\nEPLCERTOMESIS, Greek, ἐπικερτόμησις (Ep-i-ker-to-mee-sis), a\nsneering or jeering.\n\nMYCTERISMOS, Greek, µυκτηρισµός (muk-teer-is-mos), a turning\nup of the nose at, sneering, or snuffing, from µυκτήρ (mukteer), the\nnose, snout, nostrils.\n\nThe figure is used when the speaker or writer excites laughter by a\njeer or sneer; or excites ridicule by turning up the nose.\n\nThis is exactly what the Holy Spirit says the Pharisees did at the\nLord’s teaching in Luk. 16:14, and which led Him to rebuke them, and\nput them to shame and silence by a parable similar to those they were\nfond of using (See Lightfoot).\n\nIt is also what Jehovah will do, in return, to those who have thus\ntreated His Anointed.',''),(183,183,'erotesis','Erotesis; or, Interrogating\n\nThe Asking of Questions without waiting for the Answer\n\nEr’-6-tee’-sis. Greek, ἐρώτησις, interrogation (from ἐρωτᾶν, to ask, to\nenquire, to question: also to request).\n\nThis figure is used when a speaker or writer asks animated\nquestions, but not to obtain information. Instead of making a plain and\ndirect statement, he suddenly changes his style, and puts what he\nwas about to say or could otherwise have said, into the form of a\nquestion, without waiting for an answer. Instead of declaring a\nconviction, or expressing indignation, or vindicating authority, he puts\nit in the form of a question without expecting any reply\nThe figure is so important that not only is it of frequent occurrence,\nbut it has several other names. It is called\n\nPEUSIS (peu’-sis). Greek, πεῦσις, an asking, inquiry (from\nπεύθοµα! (peuthomai): poetic present of πυνθάνοµαι (punthanomai),\nto ask, inquire).\n\nPYSMA (pys’-ma). Greek, πύσµα (pusma), what is learnt by the\ninterrogation (from the same root).\n\nThe Latins called it PERCONTATIO, an asking, inquiring after, and\nINTERROGATIO, an interrogating.\n\nWhile these names are all used of the act of interrogation, the\nquestion itself is called EROTEMA (er’-o-tee-ma).\n\nThere are questions in the Hebrew which are not reproduced in\nthe English; and some are given below, though the labour of making\nan exhaustive list would be too great.\nBut, counting the questions as they appear in the English Bible,\nthe importance of this figure Erotesis, or Interrogating, will be seen\nwhen we state that, in the 1,189 chapters into which the Bible is\ndivided, there are no less than 3,298 questions. It is clear, therefore,\nthat it is impossible for us here to quote, or even to give, all the\nreferences. Out of the 1,189 chapters of the Bible there are only 453\nwhich are without a question.\n\nThese are divided as follows:-The 929 chapters of the Old\nTestament contain 2,274 questions; while the 260 chapters of the New\nTestament contain no less than 1,024. The average of questions in the\nNew Testament is much higher, per chapter, than that in the Old\nTestament. For, while the average of the whole Bible is 2.75 ({6., 2%\nquestions for every chapter), the Old Testament average Isa. 2:3 (or\n2&frac13;), and the New Testament nearly twice as much: viz., 3.9 (or\nnearly 4).\n\nThis is how the Bible is affected as a whole. When we come to the\nseparate Books, we find that Job stands first with 329 questions; while\nJeremiah comes next with 195.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Matthew stands first with 177\nquestions; then John’s Gospel with 167: etc.\nWhen we come to separate chapters, Job. 38:1-41 stands first with\n40 questions; then 2Sa. 19:1-43, with 22 questions. In the New\nTestament, 1Co. 9:1-27 stands first, with 20 questions; followed\nclosely by Joh. 7:1-53, which has 19.\n\nThese facts are interesting, but are not important, as to the\nchapters; inasmuch as these are only human in their origin, and are\noften very incorrectly divided. As to the two Testaments and the\nseparate books, however, they serve to show us the relative\ndistribution of this beautiful figure Erotesis.\n\nWith regard to the questions themselves, their classification is\nanother matter altogether. Some are searching, causing the mind to\npause, wonder, and admire. Some are revelations of the attributes of\nGod, and of the depravity of man. The very first Divine question of the\nOld Testament reveals the condition of man by nature: “WHERE ART\nTHOU?” It comes from God to the sinner, now “far off’ (Eph. 2:13),\nfrom God. While the first question in the New Testament reveals the\neffect of this on the sinner’s heart, causing him to turn to that Saviour\nwhom the New Testament reveals, and cry, “WHERE IS HE?”\n\nThe questions of the Bible, whether God addresses them to man;\nor whether man turns to God; or whether he questions himself; contain\na mine of truth and teaching; while the heart is awakened, and the\nattention is aroused to seek out the answer, which is ever fraught with\ndeep and blessed instruction.\n\nWe have only to reflect on the interesting fact that the figures used\nmost frequently by the Lord Jesus are Interrogation and Implication\n(Erotesis and Hypocatastasis). The very first thing that is mentioned\nconcerning Him as the first act of His life, is that He was found “in the\ntemple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and\nasking them questions” (Luk. 2:46).\n\nDoubtless He could teach them much that would astound them, by\nthe use of this Figure, in spite of the disparity of age. For a child of\ntwelve years of age may question, when he may not teach; and yet, by\nthis simple means, teach more effectively than the greatest of\nteachers. No wonder that “all that heard him were astonished.”\n\nAll writers and speakers have always drawn largely on this Figure,\nand many interesting examples might be given from general literature.\nScience lifts its head against the word of God as though all were\nuncertainty outside of its own proud boastings. And yet a few\nquestions soon prick and burst the bubble.\n\nScientia means real or intuitive knowledge, as does its Greek\nrepresentative γνῶσις (gndésis). (Hence our words “know” and\n“knowledge”). Neither of these words means acquired knowledge. But\nbeyond a very few facts and the small circle of mathematical\ndemonstrations: How little is really known! What is matter? What is\nmind? What is life? What is light? What is electricity? What is\ngravitation? or, Is there any such thing at all? What is the history of our\nown earth geologically? Who can tell us this? So long ago as 1806,\nthe French Institute tabulated more than eighty geological theories,\nand how many have there been since then?\n\nWe merely give this as illustrating how we may ourselves, by a few\nquestions, dispose of the giants who would demolish us and rob us of\nthe Inspired Word of God, which comes to us in all its blessed and\nDivine certainty.\n\nWe turn, then, to its questions; and our best course will be to\nindicate certain divisions into which they may be classified; so that the\nBible-searching student may have somewhere to place the questions,\nas he seeks them out and finds them.\nSeveral classifications have been attempted by various writers\nfrom Glassius downwards, and probably none is either correct or\ncomplete. The subject is too large, and its divisions over-lap too much,\nto allow of too minute an arrangement.\n\nWe might classify them under their subject matter, or under the\nwords with which they commence (“Who,” “How,” “Why,” “Whether,”\netc.).\n\nIf we used both these divisions they would get mixed up, and\nmany questions would appear in each. So that we present the\nfollowing, as embracing practically all the divisions into which the\nquestions of the Bible may be classified.\n\n1. In positive affirmation.\n2. In negative affirmation.\n3. In affirmative negation.\n4. In demonstration.\n5. In wonder and admiration.\n6. In rapture.\n7. In wishes.\n8. In refusals and denials.\n9. In doubts.\n10. In admonition.\n11. In expostulation.\n12. In prohibition or dissuasion.\n13. In pity and commiseration.\n14. In disparagement.\n15. In reproaches.\n16. In lamentation.\n17. In indignation.\n18. In absurdities and impossibilities.\n19. Double questions.',''),(184,184,'dialogismos','Dialogismos; or, Dialogue\n\nDj-al-o-gis-mos. Greek, διαλογισµός, conversation, arguing, from\nδιαλογίζεσθαι (dialogizesthai), to converse, argue.\n\nThis figure is used when we represent one or more persons as\nspeaking about a thing, instead of saying it ourselves: Dialogue.\n\nThe persons speak in a manner suitable to their character or\ncondition.\n\nWhen there are not two persons represented, but the objecting\nand answering is done by the one speaker, the figure is called\nLOGISMUS, and what is stated is said to be in dialogismo, or in\nlogismo.\n\nSometimes the speaker brings forward another as speaking, and\nuses his words, adapting them to the object in view.\n\nThe Latins called this figure SERMOCINATIO, which means the\nsame thing.',''),(185,185,'dianoea','Dianeea; or, Animated Dialogue\n\nDi’-a-noe’-a. Greek, διάνοια, a revolving in the mind. This Figure is\nemployed when the speaker uses animated questions and answers in\ndeveloping an argument.\n\nThe Latins called it SUBJECTIO, a substituting, RESPONSIO, a\nresponding.\n\nIt is a form of Dialogismos (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).',''),(186,186,'affirmatio','Affirmatio; or, Affirmation\n\nSpontaneous Affirmation\n\nAffirmation becomes a Figure when it is used otherwise than in\nanswer to a question; or, instead of a bare statement of the fact.\n\nIt emphasizes the words thus to affirm what no one has disputed.',''),(187,187,'negatio','Negatio; or, Negation\n\nSpontaneous Negation\n\nNegation is used in a similar way as a Figure, when it is a denying of\nthat which has not been affirmed: i.e., when, instead of merely making\na statement, it is put in the form of a denial.',''),(188,188,'accismus','Accismus; or, Apparent Refusal\n\nAc-cis’-mus, a cutting all but through, from the Latin, accido.

Greek Αἰτιολογία, rendering a reason, from\naitia (aitia), a cause, and λόγος (logos), a description.\n\nThe figure is used when, either directly or indirectly, the speaker or\nwriter renders a reason for what he thinks, says, or does.\n\nThe figure was also called APODEIXIS (Ap-o-deix’-is). Greek,\nἀπόδειξις, full demonstration, from ἀποδεικνύναι (apodeiknunai), to\npoint out, demonstrate.\n\nThe Latins called it CAUS. REDDITIO: rendering a reason, or\nshowing the cause.',''),(190,190,'anteisagoge','Anteisagoge; or, Counter-Question\n\nThe Answering of one Question by asking another\n\nAn-teis’-a-g6‘-gee. Greek, ἀντεισαγωγή, a bringing in instead; from\nἀντί (anti), against or instead; sic (eis), in; ἄγειν (agein), to lead or\nbring.\n\nThe figure is so called, because a question is answered by asking\nanother.\n\nIt is called also ANTICATALLAXIS (an -ti-cat’-al-lax’-is). Greek,\nἀντικατάλλαξις, a setting off or balancing of one thing against another\n(as in trade).\n\nThe Greeks called it also ANTHUPOPHORA (an’-thu-poph -o-ra).\nGreek, ἀνθυποφορά, a reply to an objection; from avti (anti), against,\nὑπτό (hupo), φέρειν (pherein), to bring.\n\nHence the Latin names of the Figure: COMPENSATIO,\ncompensation, and CONTRARIA ILLATIO, a bringing in against.',''),(191,191,'antistrophe','Antistrophe; or, Retort\n\nA turning the Words of a Speaker against himself\n\nAn-tis-tro-phee. Greek, ἀντιστροφή, a turning about, from avti (anti),\nagainst, and στρέφω (strepho), to turn.\nThe figure is so called because the words of a speaker are turned\nagainst himself in Retort.\n\nWhen the retort is violent, it is called BION (Bi-ae-on), Greek,\nΒίαιον, forcible, violent, compulsory.\n\nHence the Latin, VIOLENTUM, violent, and INVERSIO, inversion,\na turning against.',''),(192,192,'anticategoria','Anticategoria; or, Tu Quoque\n\nThe use of a Counter-Charge, or Recrimination\n\nAn‘-ti-cat’-ee-gor’-i-a. Greek, ἀντικατηγορία, a counter-charge: from\nἀντί (anti), against, and κατηγορέω, to speak against: hence, to\nrecriminate, to accuse in turn.\n\nThe figure is used when we retort upon another the very\ninsinuation or accusation which he has made against us. It differs from\nAntistrophe (see above); in that it has to do, not with any general kind\nof words, but with a particular accusation.\n\nIt is what the Latins called a TU QUOQUE; or, ACCUSATIO\nADVERSA, an opposite accusation, or an accusation turned against\nanother; or, TRANSLATIO IN ADVERSARIUM, a transferring against\nan adversary.',''),(193,193,'metastasis','Metastasis; or, Counter-Blame\n\nA transferring of the Blame from one’s self to another\n\nMe-tas’-ta-sis. Greek, µετάστασις, from µετά (meta), beyond, over,\nand στάσις, a standing or placing (from ἱστάναι (histanai), to put or\nplace).\nHence, Metastasis means a placing beyond: {6., a transferring.\n\nHence called by the Latins TRANSLATIO, a translating.\n\nThe Figure is so called because it is a transferring of blame from\none person or thing to another.',''),(194,194,'anacoenosis','Anaccenosis; or, Common Cause\n\nAn Appeal to others as having interests in Common\n\nAn‘-a-coe-né-sis.

Hence, βουλεύμεσθαι (bouleuesthai), to\ndeliberate.\n\nThe Latins called it COMMUNICATIO, a making common.\n\nThe figure is an appeal to the feelings or opinions of others, which\nthey have in common with ourselves, and to which we submit the\nmatter.\n\nWhen this is done by way of question, it is a form of Erotesis (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).',''),(195,195,'synchoresis','Synchoresis; or, Concession\n\nMaking a Concession of one Point to gain another\n\nSyn’-ché-ree’-sis. Greek, συλχώρησις, concession, acquiescence,\nconsenting, from συγχωρέω (synchore6d), to come together, agree.\n\nThe figure is used when we make a concession of one point in\norder to gain another. In this case the concession or admission is\nmade, and may be rightly made, in order to gain a point.\n\nIt thus differs from Epitrope (see below), where we admit\nsomething that is wrong in itself for the sake of argument.\n\nSynchoresis, therefore, is concession, while Epitrope is admission\nor surrender.\n\nThe Latins called it CONCESSIO, concession, while the Greeks\nhad another name for it, EPICHORESIS (Ep~-i-ché-ree~-sis), an\nagreement upon a point.',''),(196,196,'epitrope','Epitrope; or, Admission\n\nAdmission of Wrong in order to gain what is Right\n\nE-pit’-ro-pee. Greek, ἐπιτροπή, reference, arbitration, from ἐπιτρέπειν,\nto turn over, surrender, (from ἐτή (epi), upon, and τρέπειν (trepein), to\nturn).\n\nThe Figure is used when we surrender a point which we feel to be\nwrong, but we admit it for the sake of argument. In Synchoresis (q.v.\n[Note: Which see.] ), we concede what is right in itself; but, in\nEpitrope, we admit what is wrong, giving way to the feelings or\nunreasonableness of another, in order that we may more effectually\ncarry our point.\n\nThe Latins called it PERMISSIO, a giving up, unconditional\nsurrender.\n\nThe figure sometimes approaches to /rony (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]\n); when “what is admitted” is not really granted, but only apparently so\nfor argument’s sake.',''),(197,197,'paromologia','Paromologia; or, Confession\n\nA Concession in Argument to gain Favour\n\nPar-o-mo-log’-i-a. Greek, παροµολογία, confession, from παρά (para),\nby, or near, and ὁμολογεῖν (homologein), to confess.\n\nThis Figure is used when we acknowledge some fault or wrong\n\nwith a view to gain favour. Hence the Latins called it CONFESSIO,\nconfession, acknowledgment.',''),(198,198,'protherapeia','Protherapeia; or, Conciliation\n\nThe securing of Indulgence for what is about to be said\n\nPro-ther-a-pei-a. Greek, προθεραπεία, previous care or treatment,\nfrom πρό (pro), before, and θεραπεία (therapeia), service.\n\nThe Figure is used when, by way of precaution, we secure\nindulgence, or conciliate others, with reference to something we are\nabout to say.\n\nIt is called also PROEPIPLEXIS, pro-ep-i-pleex’-is, from πρό\n(pro), before, and ἐπίπληξις, blame, a blaming (of one’s self)\nbeforehand. i.e., in order to secure the attention or favour of another.\n\nWhen it is added at the end of what is said, it is called\nEpitherapeia (q.v.

Greek, προκατάληψις, а\nseizing beforehand, pre-occupation.\n\nAPANTESIS (Ap -an-tee’-sis). Greek, ἁπάντησις, a meeting;\nhence a meeting of an objection by anticipation.\n\nThe Latins called it:\n\nOCCUPATIO, anticipation.\n\nANTEOCCUPATIO, anticipation beforehand.\n\nPRMONITIO, a defending beforehand, obviating objections.\nAll these different names show us the importance of the figure in\nargumentation.\n\nThere is another kind of Prolepsis, which has to do only with time.\nIt is distinguished from our present figure in that while it anticipates\nand speaks of future things as present it really adjourns the\napplication of the words, and is called AMPLIATIO, or adjournment.\n(See pages 689 and 914).\n\nThe form of Prolepsis which we are considering is an anticipation\nwhich has to do with Argumentation; and hence is distinguished from\nthe other by the word OCCUPATIO: i.e., we not only anticipate what is\ncoming, but occupy and deal with it, instead of adjourning or Putting it\noff. See Section 4, above.\n\nProlepsis, as relating to Argumentation is of two kinds: (i.) Tecta,\nor, closed; and (ii.) Aperta, or, open.\n\nI. Tecta, or Closed Prolepsis, is where the anticipated objection\n\nis merely stated or implied, not answered; or answered, but not\nplainly stated.\n\nII. Aperta, or Open Prolepsis, is where the anticipated objection\n\nis both answered and stated.\n\nWe will consider these in order with the different names which\nhave been given to them.','');

The omitted word may be a noun,\nadjective, pronoun, verb, participle, adverb, preposition.\n|. The Omission of Nouns and Pronouns\n1. The Omission of the Nominative\n\nGen. 14:19-20.-Melchizedek said to Abram, “Blessed be the most\nhigh God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And he\n[18., Abram] gave him tithes of all.”\n\nFrom the context, as well as from Heb. 7:4, it is clear that it was\nAbram who gave the tithes to Melchizedek, and not Melchizedek to\nAbram.\n\nGen. 39:6.-“And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew\nnot ought he had, save the bread Which he did eat. And Joseph was a\ngoodly person, and well-favoured.”\n\nHere it is not at all clear which it was of the two who “knew not\nought he had.” If we understand Potiphar, it is difficult to see how he\nonly knew the bread he ate: or if Joseph, it is difficult to understand\nhow he knew not ought he had.\n\nIf the Ellipsis, however, is rightly supplied, it makes it all clear.\n\nThe verse may be rendered, and the Ellipsis supplied as follows:-\n“And he [Potiphar] left all that he had in Joseph’s hand: and he\n[Potiphar] knew not anything save the bread which he was eating. And\nJoseph was beautiful of figure, and beautiful of appearance.”\nAll difficulty is removed when we remember that “the Egyptians\nmight not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto\nthe Egyptians” (43:32). Everything, therefore, was committed by\nPotiphar to Joseph’s care, except that which pertained to the matter of\nfood.\n2Sa. 3:7.-“And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the\ndaughter of Aiah, and ... said to Abner, Wherefore, etc.”\n\nHere it is clear from the Sense of the next verse and 2Sa. 21:8 that\n“Ishbosheth’ is the word to be supplied, as is done in italics.\n2Sa. 23:20.-“He slew two lionlike men of Moab.”\n\nThe Massorah points out* [Note: Ginsburg’s Edition, Vol. i., p. 106.]\nthat the word Ariel occurs three times, in this passage and Isa. 29:1.\nIn Isa. the word is twice transliterated as a proper name, while in 2Sa.\n23:20, margin, it is translated lions of God: the first part of the word\nalun (агее) a lion, and the second part AM (ϱ) God. But if we keep\nit uniformly and consistently as a proper name we have with the\nEllipsis of the accusative (sons) the following sense: “He slew the two\nsons of Ariel of Moab.”\n2Sa. 24:1.-“And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against\nIsrael, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel\nand Judah.”\n\nHere the nominative to the verb “moved” is wanting. Someone\nmoved, and who that was we learn from 1Ch. 21:1, from which it is\nclear that the word Satan or the Adversary is to be supplied, as is\ndone in the margin:-“And again the anger of the Lord was kindled\nagainst Israel, and [the Adversary] moved David against them to say,\nGo, number Israel and Judah.”\n1Ch. 6:28 (12).-“And the sons of Samuel; the firstborn Vashni (marg.\n[Note: arg. Margin.] , called also Joel, ver. 33 and 1Sa. 8:2) and\nAbiah.”\n\nHere there is an Ellipsis of the name of the firstborn: while the\nword θμιρῆ, Vashni, when otherwise pointed (CLUB) means “and\nthe second”! so that the verse reads,\n\n“And the sons of Samuel; the firstborn [Joe/] and the second\nAbiah.” This agrees with the Syriac Version. The R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, and translates\nvashni “and the second.”\n\n“Joel” is supplied from ver. 33 (see also 1Sa. 8:2, and the note in\nGinsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible).\nPsa. 34:17.-“[They] cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out\nof all their troubles.”\n\nThe immediate subject in ver. 16 is evildoers. But it is not these\nwho cry. It is the righteous. Hence the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supply the words “the righteous”\nin italics. The nominative is omitted, in order that our attention may be\nfixed not on their persons or their characters, but upon their cry, and\nthe Lord’s gracious answer.\n\nThe same design is seen in all similar cases.\n\nPsa. 105:40.-“[They] asked, and he brought quails,” i.e., the People\nasked. The nominative is supplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] But the R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates it literally “They asked.”\nPro. 22:27.-“If thou hast nothing to pay, why should one [i.e., the\ncreditor] take away thy bed from under thee?”\n\nIsa. 26:1.-“In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; we\nhave a strong city; salvation will one [i.e. God] appoint for walls and\nbulwarks.”\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] interprets by supplying the nominative. The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates it literally.\nJer. 51:19.-“He is the former of all things, and /srael is the rod of his\ninheritance.”\n\nHere both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] supply the Ellipsis from 10:16. Had it been supplied from the\nimmediate context, it would have come under the head of Relative\nEllipsis, or that of Repetition.\n\nEze. 46:12.-“Now when the Prince shall prepare a voluntary offering\nor peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord, one shall then open him\nthe gate that looketh toward the East, &c.,” ie., ДЩТШ the gate-\nkeeper (supplied from the noun ДЩТШ, the gate), which follows,\nshall open the gate.\n\nZec. 7:2.-“When they (Heb. he) had sent unto the house of God,\nSherezer and Regem-melech and their men, to pray before the Lord”\n[18., when the people who had returned to Judea had sent].\n\nMat. 16:22.-“Be it far from Thee, Lord.”\n\nHere the Ellipsis in the Greek is destroyed by the translation. The\nGreek reads, “IAcewc¢ σοι, κύριε” (hileds soi, kyrie), which is\nuntranslatable literally, unless we supply the Ellipsis of the Nominative,\nthus: “[God be] merciful to Thee, Lord!” Thus it is in the Septuagint\n1Ch. 11:19, where it is rendered “God forbid that | should do this\nthing,” but it ought to be, “[Соа] be merciful to me [to keep me from\ndoing] this thing.”\n\nAct. 13:29.-“And when they had fulfilled all that was written, of him,\nthey took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre,” {6.,\nJoseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus took him down. But it is the act\nwhich we are to think of here rather than the persons who did it.\nHence the Ellipsis.\n\n1Со. 15:25.-“For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his\nfeet,” {6., “he [the Son] must reign, until he [the Son] shall have put all\nthings under his [the Son’s] feet.” Here the subjection refers to the\nperiod of Christ\'s personal reign.\n\nThis is one of the seven New Testament references to Psa. 110:1,\n“Jehovah said unto Adon-Sit thou at my right hand, until | make thine\nenemies thy footstool.” The English word “make” occurs 1,111 times in\nthe Old Testament, as the rendering of 49 Hebrew words. The one so\nrendered here is Lb (Sheeth) and means to put, place, set, or\nappoint, and is rendered make only 19 times out of 94. Its proper\nmeaning is put or appoint. (See Gen. 3:15; Gen. 4:25; Gen. 30:40.\nPsa. 140:5. Isa. 26:1, &c.)\nThe word in the N. Т. is τίθηµι (titheemi), and has the same\nmeaning. It is rendered make only 10 times out of 91, but in these\ncases it means to set or appoint (Act. 20:28. Rom. 4:17, &c.). In every\ncase the verb is in the second aorist subjunctive, and should be\nrendered “shall have put.”\n\nSix of the seven references (Mat. 22:44. Mar. 12:36. Luk. 20:42.\nAct. 2:34. Heb. 1:13; Heb. 10:13) refer to Christ’s session on the\nFather’s throne (not to His reign upon His own, Rev. 3:21). And this\nsession will continue until such time as the Father shall have placed\nChrist\'s enemies as a footstool for His feet. When that shall have been\ndone, He will rise up from His seat and come forth into the air for His\npeople, to receive them to Himself, and take them up to meet Him in\nthe air so to be ever with the Lord. Then He will come unto the earth\nwith them, and sit upon the throne of His glory, and reign until He shall\nhave put all enemies under His feet. The other six passages refer to\nChrist\'s session. This one refers to His reign upon His own throne (not\nto His session on His Father’s throne, Rev. 3:21). And this reign will\ncontinue until He (Christ) hath put all His enemies under His feet.\nNote, that in the six passages His enemies are placed “as a\nfootstool for His feet,” and there is not a word about their being under\nHis feet. In the one passage (1Co. 15:25) there is not a word about\nbeing placed “as a footstool,” but the word “under” His feet is used.\nWe must distinguish between placing and making, and Christ\'s\nsession and His reign. Then all these passages teach the Pre-\nMillennial and Pre-Tribulation coming of Christ for His people before\nHis coming with them.* [Note: See Things to Come for October, 1898.]\n1Со. 15:53.-“For this corruptible [body] must put оп incorruption, and\nthis mortal [body] must put on immortality.”\n\nThe noun “body” must also be supplied in the next verse.\n\nEph. 1:8.-“Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and\nprudence.”\n\nIt is not “wherein,” but ἧς (hees) which, ie., “[the knowledge] or\ngrace, which he hath made to abound in us in all wisdom and\nprudence.”\n\nTit. 1:15.-“Unto the pure all things are pure.”\n\nThe noun “meats” (i.e., foods) must be supplied as in 1Co. 6:12.\n\n“All [meats] indeed are clean to the clean.” The word “clean” being\nused in its ceremonial or Levitical sense, for none can be otherwise\neither “pure” or “clean.”\n\nHeb. 11:1.-“Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of\ndivine service.” Here the word covenant is properly supplied in italics.\n2Pe. 3:1.-“This second epistle, beloved, | now write unto you; in both\nwhich | stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance,” i.e., “In both\nwhich [epistles] | stir up,” etc.\n\n1Jn. 5:16.-“If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto\ndeath, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, etc.,” i.e., “[God] shall\ngive him life.” See also Mat. 5:11; Mat. 5:15; Luk. 6:38, where men\nmust be the word supplied.\n\n2. The Omission of the Object or Accusative, etc., after the verb\n2Sa. 6:6.-“And when they came to Nachon’s threshing-floor, Uzzah\nput forth his hand to the ark of God.”\n\nHere the omission is supplied. The Ellipsis is used, and the\naccusative is omitted, in order to call our attention to the act, rather\nthan to the manner of it.\n1Ch. 16:7.-“Then on that day, David delivered first this psalm to thank\nthe Lord, etc.”\n\nThe Ellipsis might also be supplied thus: “David delivered first [the\nfollowing words] to thank the Lord, etc.”\n\nJob. 24:6.-“They reap everyone his corn in the field.”\n\nThis hardly makes sense with the context, which describes the\nwicked doings of those who know not God.\n\nThe question is whether the word Omime (beleel6) translated\n“his corn” is to be taken as one word, or whether it is to be read as two\nwords Omi ме (belee 16) which mean not their own. In this case\nthere is the Ellipsis of the accusative, which must be supplied. The\nwhole verse will then read,\n\n“They reap [their corn] in a field not their own:\n\nThey glean the vintage of the wicked,”\nwhich carries on the thought of the passage without a break in the\nargument.\n\nIf we read it as one word, then we must supply the Ellipsis\ndifferently:-“They reap their corn in a field [not their own],” so that it\ncomes, in sense, to the same thing.\n\nPsa. 21:12 (13).-“When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy\nstrings.”\n\nPsa. 44:10 (11).-“They which hate us spoil for themselves.”\n\nThe word spoil is μισῃ (shahsah), and means to plunder. And it\nis clear that the accusative, which is omitted, should be\nsupplied:-“They which hate us plunder [our goods] for themselves.”\nThe emphasis being, of course, on the act and the motive in the verb\n“plunder,” and “for themselves,” rather than on the goods which they\nplunder.\nIn verse 12 (13), both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\n\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] have supplied the accusative, “thy wealth.”\nPsa. 57:2 (3).-“I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth\nall things for me.” Here the object is supplied in the words “all things.”\nOther translators suggest “His mercy,” “His promises,” “my desires.”\nLuther has “my sorrow,” the Hebrew being BOLL! (gamar), to bring to\nan end, complete, etc. The Ellipsis is left for emphasis. Nothing is\nparticularised, so that we may supply everything. The mention of any\none thing necessarily excludes others.\n\nIn Psa. 138:8 we have the same verb (though with a different\n\nconstruction) and the same Ellipsis: but the former is translated “the\nLord will perfect,” and the latter is supplied “that which concerneth\nme”: i.e., will consummate all consummations for me.\nPsa. 94:10.-“He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct [you\namong the heathen)?” This is evidently the completion of the sense.\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] fills up the Ellipsis in the next sentence. This is of a\ndifferent character, and comes under another division: “He that\nteacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?”\nPsa. 103:9.-“Neither will he keep his anger for ever.” So in Nah. 1:2;\nJer. 3:5; Jer. 3:12.\n\nPsa. 137:5.-‘If | forget thee, О Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her\ncunning.”\n\nHere both versions thus supply the accusative. But surely more is\nimplied in the Ellipsis than mere skill of workmanship. Surely it means,\n“If | forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget me.” Let it forget\nto work for me, to feed me and to defend me, if | forget to pray for thee\nand to defend thee.\n\nPro. 24:24.-“He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him\nshall the people curse, nations shall abhor him;” i.e., “He that saith to\nthe wicked [king].” This is clear from the context.\n\nVerses 21-25 read literally. “Fear the Lord, O my son, and the king.\nWith men that make a difference (Lupa, shanah see Est. 1:7; Est.\n3:8), between a king and an ordinary man thou shalt not mingle\nthyself. For their calamity (whose? evidently that of two persons, viz.,\nthat of the king and also of the common man) shall rise suddenly; and\nwho knoweth the ruin of them both? These matters also belong to the\nwise.” To make no difference between man and man belongs to\neveryone alike, see Deu. 1:17; but to make no difference between a\nman and a king is a matter that pertains only to the wise. “/t is not\ngood to have respect of persons in judgment. He that saith to the\nwicked [king, as well as common man], Thou art righteous; him shall\nthe people curse, nations shall abhor him; but to them that rebuke him\n(i.e., the wicked king) shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come\nupon them.”\nHere there is accuracy of translation and consistency of\ninterpretation. There is only one subject in verses 21-25.* [Note: Each\n“proverb” or paragraph in the book of Proverbs is occupied with only\none subject, even if it consists of several verses. This may sometimes\nthrow light on a passage, e.g., Pro. 26:3-5, where verses 4 and 5\nfollow up the subject of verse 3, not changing the subject but enforcing\nit; i.e., “For the horse a whip, for the ass a bridle, and for the fool’s\nback a rod.” In other words you cannot reason with a horse or an ass,\nneither can you reason with a fool. Then follow two very finely stated\nfacts, not commands. If you answer him according to his folly, he will\nthink you are a fool like himself, and if you answer him not according\nto his folly, he will think that he is wise like yourself! So that we have a\nkind of hypothetical command:\n\nDo this, and you will see that;\n\nDo that, and you will see, &c.] Here it is the command not to flatter\na wicked king; and this explains the word “both” in verse 22, and the\nreference to “people” and “nations” in verse 24. Unless the Ellipsis is\nthus supplied, the meaning is not clear.\n\nThat which is a true admonition as to kingcraft, is also a solemn\nwarning as to priestcraft. The “wise” makes no difference between a\nso-called priest and another man; for he knows that all the people of\nGod are made “priests unto God” (Rev. 1:6), and “an holy priest-hood”\n(1Ре. 2:5). Those who make a difference do so to their own loss, and\nto the dishonour of Christ.\n\nIsa. 53:12.-“Therefore will | divide him a portion with the great, and he\nshall divide the spoil with the strong”; i.e., “Therefore will | [Jehovah]\ndivide (or apportion) to him a great multitude [for booty], and the\nstrong ones will he (i.e., Messiah) divide as spoil.”\n\nThe structure shows that 53:12 corresponds with, and is to be\nexplained by 52:15. The passage is concerning:-\n\nJehovah\'s Servant-the Sin Offering.\n\nА 52:13. His Presentation.\n\nВ 14. His Affliction.\nC 15. His Reward.\n&А 53:1-3. His Reception.\nВ 4-10. His Affliction.\n© 10-12. His Reward.\n\nHence the “many nations” of 52:15, answer to the “great\nmultitudes” of 53:12; and “the kings” of 52:15 answer to “the strong\nones” of 53:12. Thus the two passages explain each other. The first\nline of verse 12 is what Jehovah divides to His Servant; and the\nsecond line is what He divides as Victor for Himself and His host.\nCompare Psa. 110:2-5, Rev. 19:11-16.\n\nThe word PK] (nazah) in 52:15, means to leap, leap out: of\n\nliquids, to spurt out as blood: of people, to leap up from joy or\nastonishment. So the astonishment of verse 15 answers to that of\nverse 14. Moreover the verb is in the Hiphil, and means to cause\nastonishment.* [Note: See Things to Come, August, 1898.]\nJer. 16:7.-“Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning.”\nThe word tear is ᾧμιο (paras) to break, cleave, divide. So that the\nEllipsis will be, “Neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning”\n(as Eze. 24:17, Hos. 9:4, etc., and A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]\nand R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).\n\nSee under Idiom.\n\nJer. 8:4.-“Thus saith the Lord, Shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he\nturn away and not return?”\n\nThis is unintelligible, and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] is no clearer:-“Shall one turn away and not turn again?”\nThe fact is that the Massorah* [Note: See note on this passage in\nGinsburg’s Edition of the Hebrew Bible.] calls attention to this\npassage as one of several examples where two connected words are\nwrongly divided. Here, the first letter of the second of these two words\nshould be the last letter of the preceding word. Then the sense comes\nout most beautifully:\n\n“Shall they return [fo the Lord]\nAnd He not return [to them]?”\n\nAgreeing with Mal. 3:7, and with the context; and bringing out the\nparallel between the two lines as well as exhibiting more clearly the\nfigure of Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.])\n\nMat. 11:18.-“John came neither eating nor drinking.”\n\nClearly there must be an Ellipsis here; for John, being human,\ncould not live without food. The sense is clear in the Hebrew idiom,\nwhich requires the Ellipsis to be thus supplied in the English:-\n\n“John came neither eating [with others] nor drinking [strong drink].”\nSee Luk. 1:15. Or, observing the force of the Greek negative: “John\ncame [declining invitations] to eat and drink.”\nLuk. 9:52.-“And sent messengers before his face; and they went,\nand entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready ... for\nhim,” i.e., to prepare reception for him.\n\nJoh. 15:6.-“If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch,\nand is withered; and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and\nthey are burned.”\n\nHere the accusative “them” is not repeated.\n\nBut the meaning of the verse is obscured, or rather a new meaning\nis read into it by inconsistency of rendering. Why, we ask, are the\nwords ἐὰν µή (ean mee) translated “except” twice in verse 4, and here\nin verse 6 “if ... not’? It is an expression that occurs fifty-two times,\nand more than thirty of these are rendered “except.”t [Note: See Mat.\n5:20; Mat. 12:29; Mat. 18:3; Mat. 26:42. Mar. 3:27; Mar. 7:3-4. Joh.\n3:2-3; Joh. 3:5; Joh. 3:27; Joh. 4:48; Joh. 6:44; Joh. 6:53; Joh. 6:65;\nJoh. 12:24; Joh. 15:4 (twice); 20:25. Act. 8:31; Act. 15:1; Act. 27:31.\nRom. 10:15. 10ο. 14:6-7; 10ο. 14:9; 1Co. 15:36. 2Th. 2:3. 2Ti. 2:5.\nRev. 2:5; Rev. 2:22. yi (ei mee), if not, is also rendered “except” Mat.\n19:9; Mat. 24:22. Mar. 13:20. Joh. 19:11. Rom. 7:7; Rom. 9:29. 2Co.\n12:13.] Here it should be rendered “Except anyone abide in me.” In\nthe preceding verses the Lord had been speaking of His disciples\n“you” and “ye.” Here in verse 6 He makes a general proposition\nconcerning anyone. Not, if anyone who is already in Him does not\ncontinue in Him, for He is not speaking of a real branch; but except\nanyone is abiding in Him he is cast forth “AS a branch.”\n\nLikewise, in verse 2, the verb is αἴρω (8/6) to lift up, * [Note: As in\nLuk. 17:13. Joh. 11:41. Act. 4:24. Rev. 10:5.] raise up. “Every branch\nin me that beareth not fruit he lifteth up,” ie., He raises it from the\nground where it can bear no fruit, and tends it, that it may bring forth\nfruit, “and every branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth it, that it may\nbring forth more fruit.”\n\nThus there are two conditions spoken of-two kinds of branches:\none that bears no fruit, and one that does. The former He raises up\nthat it may bear fruit, and the latter He prunes that it may bear more.\nAct. 9:34.-“Arise, and make thy bed.”\n\nHere both versions translate the figure. The Greek reads, “Arise,\nand spread for thyself,” /.e., spread [a bed] for thyself: in other words,\n“make thy bed.”\n\nAct. 10:10.-“But while they made ready, he fell into a trance,” i.e.,\nwhile they made ready [the food].\nRom. 15:28.-“When therefore | have performed this, and have sealed\nto them this fruit, | will come by you into Spain”: i.e., “When, therefore,\n| have performed this business.”\n\n1Со. 3:1.-“And |, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual\n[men], but as unto carnal [men].” (See under 1Co. 2:2).\n\n1Co. 7:17.-“But as God hath distributed to every man.”\n\nThis is literally:-“Only as God hath apportioned [the giff] to each.”\n1Co. 10:24.-“Let no man seek his own [advantage only], but every\nman that of his neighbour [a/so].”\n\n“Wealth,” in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] is the old English word for well-being\ngenerally. As we pray in the Litany, “In all time of our wealth”; and in\nthe expression, “Commonwealth,” i.e., common weal. Compare verse\n33, where the word “profit” is used. The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] supplies “good.”\n2Co. 5:16.-“Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh\n(κατὰ σάρκα, kata sarka, according to flesh, i.e., according to natural\nstanding): yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now,\nhenceforth know we him [thus] no more.”\nOur standing is now a spiritual one, “in Christ” risen from the dead;\na standing on resurrection ground, as the members of the Mystical or\nSpiritual Body of Christ.\n2Co. 5:20.-“Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God\ndid beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled\nto God.”\n\nHere the word “you” is incorrectly supplied. Paul was not\nbeseeching the saints in Corinth to be reconciled to God. They were\nreconciled as verse 18 declares, “Who hath reconciled us to himself\nby Jesus Christ.” Then in verse 19 he goes on to speak of “men”; and\nin verse 20 he says that he beseeches them, as though God did\nbeseech them by us; we pray them in Christ\'s stead, and say:-“Be ye\nreconciled to God.” This was the tenor of his Gospel to the\nunconverted.\n2Co. 11:20.-“If a man take [your goods].”\n\nPhp. 3:13.-“Brethren, | count not myself to have apprehended [the\nprize (from verse 14)].”\n\n1Th. 3:1.-“When we could no longer forbear.” Here στέγω (stegd)\nmeans {ο hold out, to bear, to endure, and must have the accusative\nsupplied:-“Wherefore, when we could no longer bear [our anxiety],\netc.” The same Ellipsis occurs in verse 5, where it must be similarly\nsupplied.\n\n2Th. 2:6-7.-“And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be\nrevealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only\nhe who now letteth will /et, until he be taken out of the way.”\n\nHere, there is an Ellipsis. But the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] treats it as though\nit were the verb that is omitted, and repeats the verb “will let.” The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] avoids this, by translating it\nthus:-“only there is one that restraineth now, until, etc.”\n\nBoth the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] fail\nto see that it is the Ellipsis of the accusative after the verb in both\nverses. The verb is κατέχω (katechd), which is rendered “withhold” in\nverse 6 and “/ef’ in verse 7 (and in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] “restrain” in both verses). But this verb, being transitive, must\nhave an object or accusative case after it; and, as it is omitted by\nEllipsis, it has therefore to be supplied.\nThe verb κατέχω (katech6) means to have and hold fast. The\npreposition κατά (kata), in composition, does not necessarily preserve\nits meaning of down, to hold down; but it may be intensive, and mean\nto hold firmly, to hold fast, to hold in secure possession. This is proved\nby its usage; which clearly shows that restraining or withholding is no\nnecessary part of its meaning. It occurs nineteen times, and is\nnowhere else so rendered. On the other hand there are four or five\nother words which might have been better used had “restrain” been\nthe thought in this passage.\n\nIndeed its true meaning is fixed by its use in these epistles. In 1Th.\n5:21 we read “hold fast that which is good,” not restrain it or “withhold”\nthat which is good! But the idea is of keeping and retaining and\nholding on fast to that which is proved to be good. So it is in all the\npassages where the word occurs:-\n\nMat. 21:38. Let us seize on his inheritance.\n\nLuk. 4:42. And stayed him, that he should not depart.\n\nLuk. 8:15. Having heard the word, keep it.\n\nLuk. 14:9. Thou begin with shame {ο take the lowest room.\nJoh. 5:4. Of whatsoever disease he had (i.e., was held).\n\nAct. 27:40. And made toward shore (i.e., they held their\ncourse, or kept going for the shore).\n\nRom. 1:18. Who hold the truth in unrighteousness.\n\nRom. 7:6. Being dead to that wherein we were held (margin\nand R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).\n\n10ο. 7:30. As though they possessed not.\n\n10ο. 11:2. And keep the ordinances.\n\n10ο. 15:2. If ye keep in memory what | preached.\n\n2Co. 6:10. And yet possessing all things.\n\n1Th. 5:21. Hold fast that which is good.\n\nPhm. 1:13. Whom | would have retained with me.\n\nHeb. 3:6. If we hold fast the confidence.\n\nHeb. 3:14. If we hold the beginning\nHeb. 10:23. Let us hold fast the profession.\n\nThis fixes for us the meaning of the verb κατέχω. But what is it that\nthus holds fast “the man of sin’? and who is it that holds fast\nsomething which is not mentioned, and which has therefore to be\nsupplied? For, in verse 6, that which holds fast is neuter, τὸ KaTéxov\n(to katechon), while in verse 7 it is masculine © κατέχων (ho\nkatech6n):so that in verse 6 it is something (neuter) which holds the\nman of sin fast, while in verse 7 some one is holding fast to\nsomething.\n\nWe submit that in verse 6, that something is τὸ φρέαρ (to phrear)\nthe pit (Rev. 9:1-2; Rev. 11:7) out of which he ascends, and in which\nhe is now kept in sure possession until the season arrive when he is to\nbe openly revealed: meanwhile, his secret counsels and plans are\nalready working, preparing the way for his revelation.\n\nThe whole subject of the context is the revelation of two person-\nages (not of one), viz., “the man of sin” (verse 3) and “the lawless one”\n(verse 8). These correspond with the two beasts of Rev. 13:1-18\n\nThis is clear from the structure of the first twelve verses of this\nchapter:-* [Note: See The Structure of the Two Epistles to the\nThessalonians by the same author and publisher.]\n2Th. 2:1-12.\nА 1-3-. Exhortation not to be believing what the apostle did not\nsay.\nВ -3, 4. Reason. “For, etc.”\nΑ 5,6. Exhortation to believe what the apostle did say.\nВ 7-12. Reason. “For, etc.”\nOr more fully, thus:-\nА 1-3-. Exhortation (negative).\nВ а -3-. The Apostasy (open).\nЬ -3. The Revelation of the “Man of Sin.” (The Beast\nfrom the Sea, Rev. 13:1-10).\nο 4. The character of his acts. See Rev. 13:6-8.\nΑ 5-6. Exhortation (positive).\nВ а 7.Lawlessness (secret working).\nЬ — 8. The Revelation of the Lawless one. (The Beast\nfrom the Earth, Rev. 13:11-18).\nc 9-12. The character of his acts. See Rev.\n13:13-15.\n\nThus the open working Of the apostasy and the secret working of\nthe counsels of the Lawless one are set in contrast. We must note that\nthe word “mystery” means a secret, a secret plan or purpose, secret\ncounsel.* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.]\n\nThus we have here two subjects: (1) “The Man of Sin” (the beast\nfrom the sea, Rev. 13:1-10), and the open apostasy which precedes\nand marks his revelation; (2) “The Lawless one” (the beast from the\nearth, Rev. 13:11-18), and the working of his secret counsels which\nprecedes his revelation, and the ejection of the Devil from the heavens\nwhich brings it about.\n\nAn attempt has been made to translate the words, ἐκ μέσου\nγένηται (ek mesou geneetai) be taken out of the way, as meaning,\n“arise out of the midst.” But this translates an idiomatic expression\nliterally; which cannot be done without introducing error. ἐκ µέσου\nγένηται is an idiom,t [Note: See below under the figure Idioma.] for\nbeing gone away, or being absent or away.\n\nThis is clear from the other places where the idiomatic expression\noccurs.} [Note: in Mat. 13:49, the wicked are severed from among the\njust’ (1.е., taken away). In Act. 17:33, “Paul departed from among\nthem” (1.е., went away). In 23:10, he was taken “by force from among\nthem” (1.е., taken out of the way). 1Co. 5:2 is very clear, where he\ncomplains that they had not mourned that “he that hath done this thing\nmight be taken away from among you.” In 2Co. 6:17, we are\ncommanded, “Wherefore come out from among them and be ye\nseparate.” In Col. 2:14 we read of the handwriting of ordinances which\nwas against us; Christ “took it out of the way.” We have the same in\nthe Septuagint in Isa. 52:11 : “Depart ye.... go ye out of the midst of\nher,” and Isa. 57:1 : “the righteous is taken away from the evil to\ncome.”\n\nThe same usage is seen in Classical writers-Plutarch (Timol. p.\n288, 3): “He determined to live by himself, having got himself out of\nthe way,” i.e., from the public; Herodotus (3, 83; and 8, 22): The\nspeaker exhorts some to “be on our side; but, if this is impossible,\nthen sit down out of the way,” i.e., leave the coast clear as we should\nsay, keep neutral and stand aside. The same idiom is seen in Latin-\nTerence (Phorm. v. 8, 30): “She is dead, she is gone from among us”\n(Θ medio abiit). The opposite expression shows the same thing. In\nXenophon (Cyr. 5, 2, 26), one asks, “What stands in the way of your\njoining us?” (£2 2?2w 71222).\n\nThus the lawless one is, at present, being held fast in the pit (while\nhis secret counsels are at work); and the Devil is holding On to his\nposition in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:2; Eph. 6:12). But presently there\nwill be “war in Heaven” (Rev. 12:1-17), and Satan will be cast out into\nthe earth. Then in Rev. 13:1, we read, “and he (Satan) stood upon the\nsand of the sea” (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) Then it is\nthat he will call up this lawless one, whom John immediately sees\nrising up out of the sea to run his brief career, and be destroyed by the\nglory of the Lord’s appearing.\nThe complete rendering therefore of these two verses (1Th. 2:6-7),\nwill be as follows:-“And now ye know what holds him [the lawless one]\nfast, to the end that he may be revealed in his own appointed season.\nFor the secret counsel of lawlessness doth already work; only, there is\none [Satan] who at present holds fast [fo his possessions in the\nheavenlies], until he be cast out [into the earth, Rev. 12:9-12; and\n“stand upon the sand of the sea,” Rev. 13:1, R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ], and then shall be revealed that lawless one whom\nthe Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with\nthe brightness of his coming” (Isa. 11:4).\n\nJam. 5:3.-“Ye have heaped treasure together for the, last days.” The\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is tame in comparison with\nthis, “Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.” θησαυρίζω\n(theesaurizo) means simply to treasure up. In Rom. 2:5, we have the\nexpression “treasurest up wrath.” So here, there is the Ellipsis of what\nis treasured up. We may supply “wrath” here. “Ye have treasured up\n[wrath] for the last days,” or in last (or final) days, ie., days of\nextremity.\n\n1Pe. 2:23.-“But committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.”\n\nHere the omitted accusative is supplied, but it is a question\nwhether it ought to be “himself,” or rather as in the margin both of A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] “his cause.”\n3. The omission of the Pronoun\n\nWhere there can be no doubt to whom or to what the noun refers, the\npronoun is frequently omitted in the Greek, and in most cases is\nsupplied in italic type in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nThe omission of the pronoun makes it more emphatic, attention\nbeing called more prominently to it.\nMat. 19:13.-“That He should put the hands [of Him] upon them,” i.e.,\nHis hands.\nMat. 21:7.-“And put on them the clothes [of them]’ i.e., their garments,\n“and he sat upon them.” This is the reading of the critical editions.\nMar. 5:23.-“Come and lay the hands [of thee] upon her” i.e., thy\nhands. Where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] does not even put thy in italics. Compare\nMat. 9:18, where the pronoun (σου, sou) thy is used.\nMar. 6:5.-“And he laid the hands [of him] upon a few sick folk,” i.e., his\nhands. So also 8:25, 16:18; Act. 9:17.\n\nLuk. 24:40.-“And when He had thus spoken, He showed them the\nhands and the feet [of Him], i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “his hands and\nhis feet.”\n\nJoh. 11:41.-“And Jesus lifted up the eyes [of Him],” {6., his eyes.\n\nAct. 13:3.-“And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid the hands\n[of them] on them,” i.e., their hands on them.\n\nAct. 19:6.-“And when Paul had laid the hands [of him] upon them,”\nie., his hands.\n\nEph. 3:17-18.-“That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may know\nwhat is the breadth [of if], and length [of if], and the depth [of if], and\nthe height [of if],” i.e., of love. “That ye may know what is [its] breadth,\nand length, and depth, and height, etc.”\n\nHeb. 4:15.-“But was in all points tempted. according to the likeness [of\nus] apart from sin,” /.е., according to [our] likeness.\nRom. 6:3-4.-Мау be perhaps best explained by this figure. “Know ye\nnot that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus, unto his\ndeath we were baptized? Therefore we were buried together with him\nby the baptism [of him] (i.e., by his baptism) unto death.” For He had\n“a cup” to drink of (His death), and “a baptism to be baptized with” (His\nburial), and when He died and was buried, His people died and were\nburied with Him, and, as the next verse goes on to say, rose again\nwith Him.\n\nSo the passage reads: “Therefore we were buried with him by his\nbaptism-unto-death [/е., his burial], in order that just as Christ was\nraised from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also, in\nnewness of life should walk. For if we have become identified in the\nlikeness of his death, certainly in that of his resurrection also we shall\nbe: knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with [him] in\norder that the body of sin may be annulled, that we should no longer\nbe in servitude to sin. For he that hath died hath been righteously\nacquitted from the sin [of him], i.e., his sin. Now if we died together\nwith Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with him.”\n\nThe whole argument lies in this that we are reckoned as having\ndied with Him, and as having been buried with Him in His burial (or\nbaptism-unto-death). (See Mat. 20:23; Mar. 10:38-39; Luk. 12:50).\nHence all such are free from the dominion and condemnation of sin,\nand stand in the newness of resurrection life. This is “the gospel of the\nglory” (2Co. 4:4), for it was by the glory of the Father that Christ was\nraised, and it is glorious news indeed which tells us that all who are in\nChrist are “complete in Him” (Col. 2:10), “accepted in the beloved”\n(Eph. 1:6), “perfect in Christ Jesus” (Col. 1:28).\n\nWith this agrees Col. 2:10-12. “And ye are complete in him, which\nis the head of all principality and power. In whom (ἐν (), en hé) also ye\nare circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting\noff the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;\nburied with him in the baptism [of him] i.e., in his baptism-unto-death,\nin whom (ἐν ᾧ, not “wherein,” but as it is rendered above) ye were\nraised together also through the faith of the operation of God, who\nraised him from among the dead,” etc.\n\nHere, again, the whole argument turns on the fact that the\n“circumcision” and the “baptism” spoken of are both “made without\nhands,” and both are fulfilled in Christ. The whole context of these two\npassages must be studied in order to see the one point and the great\ntruth which is revealed: viz., that in His death we are circumcised and\ncut off, “crucified with Him” (Rom. 6:6): in His burial (or baptism-unto-\ndeath) we are baptized (Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12): and in His resurrection\nwe now have our true standing before God. We have all in Christ.\nHence, our completeness and perfection in Him is such that nothing\ncan be added to it. All who are baptized by Him with the Holy Spirit are\nidentified with Him in His death, burial, and resurrection. Hence, those\nwho are being baptized are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not\n(1Co. 15:29, see below), for they do not rise if Christ be not raised.\nBut, if Christ be raised, then we are raised in Him; and “Christ being\nraised from the dead dieth no more ... for in that he died, he died unto\nsin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise ye\nalso reckon yourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, IN\nCHRIST JESUS” (Rom. 6:8-11).\nRom. 2:18.-Thou “makest thy boast of God, and knowest the will [of\nhim],” i.e., his will: the will of God.\n1Ti. 6:1.-“That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.”\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads “that the name of\nGod and the doctrine be not blasphemed,” but it is better “the doctrine\n[of him],” i.e., his doctrine, as in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\n4. The Omission of Other Connected Words\n1Ki. 3:22.-“Thus they spake before the king.” It is not to be supposed\nthat two women under these exciting circum-stances would confine\nthemselves to the few concise words of verse 22! Moreover, there is\nno “thus” in the Hebrew. Literally it reads-“and they talked before the\nking,” {9., “they talked [very much] or kept talking before the king.”\n2Ki. 6:25.-“An ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and\nthe fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.” Here it\nis more correct to supply (with the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] margin) “shekels” instead of “pieces,” and translate “was at\neighty shekels of silver.”\n2Ki. 25:3.-“And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine\nprevailed.”\n\nThe Hebrew reads, “and on the ninth month.” But the Ellipsis is\ncorrectly supplied from Jer. 52:6.\n\nPsa. 119:56.-‘This | had, because | kept thy precepts;” ie., this\n[consolation] | had. Luther supplies the word “treasure.”\n\nJer. 51:31.-“One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger\nto meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at\none end.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates “on every\nquarter”! Another version renders it “to its utmost end.” Another “at the\nextremity.” Thus it is clear that there is an Ellipsis, and much confusion\nin supplying it.\n\nThe Hebrew is “from the end”: or with the Ellipsis supplied “from\n[each] end.” So in chap. 50:26 (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ), “come against her from the utmost border.” (Margin:\n“Hebrew, from the end”), i.e., as we have suggested, “from [each]\nend.”\n\nAnd so the prophecy was exactly fulfilled. The Babylonians, after\ntheir first discomfiture by Cyrus in the field, retired to the city ... and,\n85 Herodotus says, “remained т their holds.”* [Note: ?\ni 2222222222.... ἐσσωθέντες 2ῇ 222 22222222222? E? 20 G???.\nHerod. Hist. lib. i. §190. See also Xenophon, Cyrop. lib. vii. Compare\nJer. 51:30, “The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they\nhave remained in their holds.”]\n\nThe forces of Cyrus, having turned the waters of the Euphrates,\nentered the city by the bed of the river at each end; and the\nmessengers who entered at the end where the waters quitted the city\nran to meet those who had come in where the waters entered the city;\nso that they met one another. Herodotus expressly describes this in\nhis history (book i. §191). Those who were at the extremities were at\nonce slain, while those in the centre were feasting in utter ignorance of\nwhat was going on. See Dan. 5:3-4; Dan. 5:23; Dan. 5:30. Thus the\ncorrect supply of the Ellipsis is furnished and established by the exact\nfulfilment of the prophecy, proving the wonderful accuracy of the\nDivine Word.\n\nEze. 13:18.-“Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes.”\nThis may be translated literally, “Woe to those who sew together\ncoverings upon all joints of [the people ой my hands,” i.e., my people.\nThe context supplies the Ellipsis, for the subject is the deception of\nGod’s people by the false prophets; and the covering and veiling of\nverse 18 corresponds to the daubing and coating of verse 14, etc.,\nie., the making things easy for the people so that they should not\nattend to God’s word.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads, “that sew\npillows upon all elbows,” margin, “Heb. joints of the hands.” A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nmargin, “elbows.”\n\nMat. 19:17.-“Keep the commandments,” i.e., of God.\n\nMar. 6:14-16.-The parenthesis in verse 14 must be extended to the\nend of verse 15. What Herod said is stated in verse 16. The rumour of\nwhat others said is stated in the parenthesis:-“And king Herod heard\n[of these mighty works]; (for his name was spread abroad, and [one]\n+ [Note: The Greek reads ἔλεγεν (elegen), one said. The reading put\nby Tr. and R.V. in the margin, and by Lachmann, and Westcott and\nHort in the Text is esis (elegon) some said.] said that John the\nBaptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show\nforth themselves in him. Others said, It is Elias; and others said, It is a\nprophet, or as one of the prophets). But when Herod heard* [Note:\nRepeated from verse 14.] thereof, + [Note: Or when Herod heard\nthese various opinions.] he said, It is John whom | beheaded: he 15\nrisen from the dead.”\n\nLuk. 14:18.-“They all with one consent began to make excuse.”\n\nἀπὸ μιᾶς (apo mias) with one [mind], or with one [declining]: i.e.,\n\nthey all alike began to decline the invitation.\nJoh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came\ndown from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.” The\nwords translated “which is” are © ὤν (ho 6n) the article, and the\npresent participle of the verb “to be’-literally, the one being: i.e., who\nwas being, or simply who was. Compare Joh. 1:18 “who was (0 ὤν) in\nthe bosom of the Father.” Joh. 9:25, “Whereas | was blind” (τυφλὸς\nὤν). Joh. 19:38, “being a disciple,” i.e., who was a disciple. Luk.\n24:44, “I spake whilst | was yet with you” (ἔτι ὤν, ей δη). 2Co. 8:9,\n“Though he was rich” (πλούσιος ὤν, plousios 6n).\n\nHence our verse reads, “Even the Son of Man who was in\nheaven.” This agrees with Joh. 6:62, where we have the words, “What\nand if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?”\n\nThe fact taught us by this is, that the human body of the Lord\nJesus cannot be in more than one place at the same time. This fact\ncuts at the roots of all errors that are based on any presence of Christ\non earth during this present dispensation. The presence of the Holy\nSpirit is the witness to the absence of Christ. There can be no\npresence of Christ now except by the Holy Spirit. He will be present\nagain bodily only at His personal return from Heaven. Now He is\nseated at the right hand of God, “henceforth expecting,” until the\nmoment arrives for God to place His enemies as a footstool for His\nfeet, when He shall rise up to receive His people to Himself and come\nwith and reign until He shall have put all enemies under His feet. (See\nabove, page 7).\nAny presence, therefore, of Christ in the Lord’s Supper, other than\nby His Spirit in our hearts,t [Note: See the Rubrick at the end of the\nCommunion Service of the Church of England.] is a denial of His real\nhuman nature, and of His return from Heaven: and this is an error\nwhich affects both the first and second Advents. The Lord’s Supper,\ntherefore, is the witness of His rea/ absence; for it is instituted only “till\nHe come.” And not until that glorious day will there be any “real\npresence” on earth. And then it will be a bodily presence, for it is “on\nthe Mount of Olives,” that His feet will rest, and “on Mount Zion” that\nHe shall reign.\n\nAct. 10:36.-“The word which God sent unto the children of Israel\npreaching peace by Jesus Christ.”\n\nThe Ellipsis here is caused by a Hebraism, as in Hag. 2:5.\n“According to the word that | covenanted with you,” etc. So this will\nread, “[According to] the word which God sent, etc.”\n\nOr it may be taken as parallel to Psa. 107:20. “He sent his word,\nand healed them.” So Isa. 9:8. God “sent” when His Son came,\nthrough whom God proclaimed the Gospel of peace. Hence “[This is]\nthe word which God sent.”\n\nAct. 18:22.-“And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up ...\nand saluted the Church, he went down to Antioch,” i.e., “Gone up [to\nJerusalem].” As is clear from verse 21, as well as from the\ncircumstances of the case.\n\nRom. 2:27.-“And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil\nthe law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost trangress\nthe law?”\n\nHere we have, first, to note the figure of Hendiadys (q.v. [Note:\nWhich see.] ) “letter and circumcision” and translate it /iteral\ncircumcision. And next we have to preserve the emphasis marked by\nthe order of the words, which we can well do if we correctly supply the\nEllipsis:-\n\n“And shall not uncircumcision which by nature fulfilleth the law,\ncondemn thee [though thou art a Jew], who, through the literal\ncircumcision, art a trangressor of the law?”\n\nRom. 11:11.-“l say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall [for\never]? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto\nthe Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.” The fall mentioned here\nmust be interpreted by verse 1 “cast away,” and verse 25 “until,” and\nby the condition of verse 23. Is their fall the object or end of their\nstumbling? See Joh. 11:4.\n\nRom. 12:19.-“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give\nplace unto wrath.” This does not mean “yield to the wrath of your\nenemy,” but “give place to the wrath* [Note: <fj ὀσ]ῇ (tee orgee).] [of\nGod], for (the reason is given) it is written, Vengeance is mine; | will\nrepay, saith the Lord.”\n\nRom. 14:2.-“For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who\nis weak [in the faith], eateth herbs [only].”\n\nRom. 14:5.-“One man esteemeth one day above another,” i.e., “one\nman indeed (μέν), esteemeth one day [more holy] than another; but\n(δὲ) another esteemeth every day [alike].”\n\nRom. 14:20.-“All things indeed are pure,” {6., “all [meats] indeed [are]\nclean; but [it is] evil to the man who eateth with offence [to his weak\nbrother).” “Clean” here means ceremonially clean, and hence, allowed\nto be eaten.\n\nRom. 14:23.-“And he that doubteth is damned (or condemned) if he\neat,” i.e., “and he that holdeth a difference [between meats] is\ncondemned if he eat, because [he eateth] not from (ἐκ) faith; for\nwhatsoever is not of faith is sin.”\n\n1Co. 7:6.-“But | speak this [which | have said] by permission and not\ncommandment.”\n\n1Co. 9:9-10.-“Doth God take care for oxen [only]? Or saith he it\naltogether for our sakes?”\n1Co. 12:6.-The expression “all in all” is elliptical: and the sense must\nbe completed according to the nature of the subject and the context,\nboth here, and in the other passages where it occurs.\n\nHere, “it is the same God, which worketh all [these gifts] in all [the\nmembers of Christ\'s body]:” what these gifts are, and who these\nmembers are, is fully explained in the immediate context. See verses\n4-31.\n1Co. 15:28.-“Then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that\nput all things under him, that God may be all in all.” The word πάντα\noccurs six times in the 27th and 28th verses and is in each case\ntranslated correctly “all things” except in this last occurrence. We have\nno liberty to change the translation here. It must be “all things,” and to\ncomplete the sense we must render it “that God may be [over] all\nthings, in all [places]; i.e., over all beings in all parts of the universe.\nEph. 1:23.-“The church, which is His body, the fulness* [Note: The\ntermination of the word @uu: denotes the result or product of the verb\nto fill, i.e., of the act of the verb. Hence this fulness means a filling up\nin exchange for emptiness. His members fill up the Body of Christ, and\nHe fills up the members with all spiritual gifts and graces.] of him that\nfilleth all in all.” Here, we must supply:-“that filleth all [fhe members of\nHis body] with all [spiritual gifts and graces].” Compare chap. 4:10-13.\nCol. 3:11.-“Christ is all, and in all.” Here the Greek is slightly different\nfrom the other occurrences, but it is still elliptical; and the sense must\nbe completed thus:-In the new creation “there is neither Greek nor\nJew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor\nfree: but Christ is [created in] all [who believe] and in all [places of the\nworld],” i.e., Πο man is excluded on account of earthly considerations\nof condition or location from the blessings and benefits of the new\ncreation. See Gal. 3:28, where the same truth is expressed in different\nwords.\n1Co. 14:27.-“If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two,\nor at the most three [sentences, or perhaps, persons] and that by\ncourse (i.e., separately); and let one interpret.”\n2Co. 1:6.-“And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and\nsalvation, which is effectual [in you] in the enduring of the same\nsufferings which we also suffer, etc.”\n2Co. 5:5.-“Now he that hath wrought us for the self same [desire], is\nGod.”\nGal. 5:10.-“I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be\nnone otherwise minded.”\n\nThe Greek reads “that you will think nothing differently [from me].”\nPhp. 1:18.-“What then [does it matter]? at any rate, in every way,\nwhether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and | therein do\nrejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”\n1Th. 3:7.-“Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our\naffliction and distress by your faith,” i.e., “by [the news received of]\nyour faith.”\n1Th. 4:1.-“As ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to\nplease God, so ye would abound more and more [therein].” See also\nverse 10.\nHeb. 13:25.-“Grace be with you all,” i.e., “The grace [of God be] with\nyou all.”\n1Jn. 5:15.-“And if we know that he hear us [concerning] whatsoever\nwe ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.”\n1Jn. 5:19.-“The whole world lieth in wickedness:” R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] , “in the wicked one.” But this is not English.\nThe Ellipsis must be supplied thus:-“The whole World lieth in [the\npower of] the wicked one.”\n\nIl. The Omission of Verbs and Participles\nA verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer, and\nexpresses the action, the suffering, or the being, or the doing.\n\nWhen therefore the verb is omitted, it throws the emphasis on the\nthing that is done rather than on the doing of it.\n\nOn the other hand, when the noun is omitted, our thought is\ndirected to the action of the verb, and is centred on that rather than on\nthe object or the subject.\n\nBearing this in mind, we proceed to consider a few examples:-\n\n1. When the Verb Finite is wanting\nGen. 25:28.-“And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his\nvenison.” Or it may be that there is no Ellipsis, and it may mean\n“because hunting was in his [Esau’s] mouth,” i.e., on his tongue.\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] has given a very free translation. But here again,\nthe correct supply of the words omitted enables us to retain a literal\nrendering of the words that are given: “because the food taken by him\nin hunting [was sweet, or was pleasanif] in his mouth.”\nNum. 16:28.-“And Moses said, ‘Hereby ye shall know that the Lord\nhath sent me to do all these works; for not of my own mind.’ ”\n\nHere we may render it, “for not of mine own heart [have | said\nthese things]. See verse 24.\n1Sa. 19:3.-“I will commune with my father of thee; and what | see, that\n| will tell thee.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates “and if |\nsee aught.” But the Hebrew with the Ellipsis supplied, is: “and will see\nwhat [he replies], and will tell thee.”\n2Sa. 4:10.-“When one told me, saying, behold, Saul is dead, thinking\nto have brought good tidings, | took hold of him, and slew him in\nZiklag, who thought that | would have given him a reward for his\ntidings.”\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] has supplied the verb “thought,” but perhaps the\nverb “had come” is better, i.e., “who [had come] that | should give him\na reward for his tidings.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates, “which\nwas the reward | gave him for his tidings.”\n2Sa. 18:12.-“Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.”\n\n2Sa. 23:17.-This is a case in which the Ellipsis is wrongly supplied in\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] “And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord, that | should do\nthis: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their\nlives?”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] rightly supplies from\n1Ch. 11:19, “Be it far from me, О Lord, that | should do this: shail |\ndrink the blood of the men, etc.”\n1К!. 11:25.-“And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of\nSolomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did,” i.e., that Hadad\nwrought or brought upon him.\n1Ki. 14:6.-“I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.” The Hebrew is, “I am\nsent to thee hard.”\n\nThe Ellipsis may thus be supplied: “I am sent to thee [fo tell thee,\nor to bring thee, or to prophesy to thee] hard [things]. See verse 5.\n1К!. 22:36.-“And there went a proclamation throughout the host about\nthe going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every\nman to his own country.” Here the verb return is to be supplied. “Let\nevery man return to his city, etc.,” or “[Return] every man to his city,\netc.”\n\n2Ki. 25:24.-The word “fled” is not in the Hebrew. The Ellipsis is thus\nsupplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\ncorrectly in italics.\nEzr. 10:14.-“Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let\nall them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at\nappointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges\nthereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned\naway.”\n\nThe Hebrew of the last clause reads, “Until (TI) the fierce wrath of our\nGod be turned back from us, until (TI) this matter [be carried οι.”\n\nThis filling up of the Ellipsis enables us to take the other words in\nthe verse literally. The non-observance of the figure leads the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] to give two different meanings (viz., “until” and “for’) to the\nword TI until, which is used twice in the same passage.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads, “Until the\nfierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be\ndispatched,” and gives an alternative in the margin for the last clause\n“as touching this matter.”\n\nEzr. 10:19.-“And being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their\ntrespass.”\nHere the Ellipsis of the verb is properly supplied.\nJob. 3:21.-“Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more\nthan for hid treasures [but find it nof].”\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] supplies the first verb, but not the second.\nJob. 4:6.-“/s not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the\nuprightness of thy ways?”\nThe Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it:-“Is not thy\nfear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways?”\nThese two lines are arranged as an introversion in the Hebrew:-\nIs not thy fear\nthy confidence?\nAnd thy hope\nthe integrity of thy ways?\nOr by transposing the words they may be exhibited as an alternation:\nIs not thy fear thy confidence?\nAnd the integrity of thy ways, thy hope?\n\nIt should be noted that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\n\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] of 1611 originally read, “/s not\nthis thy feare thy confidence; the uprightness of thy wayes and thy\nhope?” The change first appears in the Cambridge edition of 1638.\nBut by whom this and many similar unauthorised changes have been\nmade in the text of the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] of 1611, is not known, and can only\nbe conjectured!* [Note: See Appendix Α.]\nJob. 39:13 seems to have caused much trouble to the translators.\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] reads, “Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the\npeacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?” The R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] and other versions which ignore the\nEllipsis (which the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies) have to give a very\nunnatural translation, and miss the challenge which is connected with\nall the other wonders of God’s works in these chapters.\n\nThe scanty featherless wing of the ostrich (LUPP/H renana, not\npeacock) is contrasted with the warm full-feathered wing of the stork(C/ Г.\nchaseedah, not ostrich), and man is challenged, “Didst thou give\neither the one or the other?”\n\nPsa. 4:2.-°О ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into\nshame?”\nPsa. 22:16.-“They pierced my hands and my feet.” Through not\nseeing the Ellipsis of the verb in this verse, the word in the Hebrew\ntext nan (karee), as a lion, has been translated as though it were\na verb Лаше (karoo) they pierced.t (Note: In the first case the Kaph\nЛ is rendered “as” and is prefixed to alun (aree) a lion; in the latter\ncase it forms part of the verb JILU@=(karoo).] But we have no\nauthority thus to ignore the printed text. On the contrary, verse 16\ncorresponds exactly with verse 12. In verse 12 we have two animals,\n“bulls” and “a lion” (the first plural, and the second singular). So also\nwe have in verse 16, two animals, “dogs” and “a lion.” If, however, we\ntake karee as a noun, there is an Ellipsis of the verb, which we may\nwell supply from Isa. 38:13, and then we may translate the rest\nliterally: “As a lion [they will break up] my hands and my feet.”* [Note:\nSee Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Hebrew Bible,\nр. 969.]\nThe structure of the passage proves that this is the case. Verses\n12-17 form the Centre of this part of the Psalm:-\nА 12-13. They. Beasts surrounding: “bulls” (pl. [Note: |. The\nPlural Number.] ), and “a lion” (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular\nNumber,] ).\nВ 14-15. |. The consequence. “I am poured out like water.”\n\nА 16. They. Beasts surrounding: “dogs” (pl. [Note: |. The Plural\nNumber.] ), and “a lion” (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular\nNumber,] ).\n\nВ 17. Ι. The consequence. “I may tell all my bones.”\nPsa. 25:15.-“Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,” /е., “mine eyes\nare ever lifted up or looking toward the Lord.” See Psa. 121:1. The\nverb is omitted, that We may not think of the act of looking, but at the\nobject to which we look.\nPsa. 120:7.-1 am for peace; but when | speak, they are for war.”\nThere are no verbs in the Hebrew, which is:-“l peace; but when |\nspeak, they for war.” The verbs to be supplied are doubtless, “I [/ove]\npeace; but when | speak they [cry ouf] for war,” or “they break forth\ninto war.”\nEcc. 8:2.-“l counsel thee keep the king’s commandment.”\nIsa. 60:7.-“For your shame ye shall have double.” Here the Ellipsis is\nproperly supplied. (See this passage under other Figures).\nIsa. 66:6.-“A voice of noise (tumult, Ι.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] ) from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that\nrendereth recompense to his enemies”: i.e., a voice of tumult is heard\nfrom the city, a voice sounds forth from the temple, etc.\nJer. 18:14.-“Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from\nthe rock of the field?”\n\nThere is no sense whatever in this rendering, and the R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] is but tittle better: “Shall the snow of\nLebanon fail from the rock of the field?”\n\nThe Ellipsis is not to be supplied by the verb “cometh.” But it\nshould be:\n\n“Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon for the rock of the field?\n\nOr shall the cold flowing waters be forsaken for strange waters?”\nJer. 19:1.-“Go and get (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] buy)\na potter’s earthen vessel and take of the elders of the people, &c.”\nHos. 8:1.-“He shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord:”\nié., as an eagle shall the enemy come against the house of the Lord.\nAmo. 3:11.-“Thus saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah): an adversary\nthere shall be, etc.” So the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nBut “an adversary shall come,” would be better.”\n\nMat. 26:5.-“But they said, not on the feast day,” i.e., Let us not do it on\nthe feast day (so also Mar. 14:2).\nAct. 15:25.-“Certain which went out from us have troubled you with\nwords, subverting your souls, saying, ye must be circumcised, and\nkeep the law,” {6., saying, ye ought to be circumcised, and to keep the\nlaw.\n\nRom. 2:7-10.-There are several ellipses in these verses which may be\nthus supplied.\n\n“To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory\nand honour and immortality [he will give] eternal life. But unto them\nthat are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey\nunrighteousness, [shall come] indignation and wrath, tribulation and\nanguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first and\nalso of the Gentile* [Note: In Deu. 28:53, this is applied to the Jew (cf.\nSept.). “In thy anguish and tribulation wherewith thine enemy shall\nafflict thee.” (A.V., “In the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine\nenemies shall distress thee”). Cf. Isa. 8:22.\n\nWhile in Isa. 13:9, this is applied to the Gentile.\n\nThus these words are applied even in the Old Testament: “to the\nJew first, and also to the Gentile.”] ; but glory, honour, and peace [shall\nbe rendered] to every man that worketh good, to the dew first and also\nto the Gentile.”\nRom. 4:9.-“Cometh this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or\nupon the uncircumcision also?”\n\nLe., “This blessedness, then, [cometh it only] on the circumcision?”\nRom. 6:19.-“For as ye have yielded your members servants to\nuncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your\nmembers servants to righteousness unto holiness.”\n\nLe., “To [work] iniquity”: and “to [work] holiness.”\n\nRom. 11:18.-“Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou\nbearest not the root, but the root thee,” {6., but if thou boast, / te/l thee\n(or know thou) thou bearest not the root, but the root beareth thee.\nRom. 13:11.-“And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to\nawake out of sleep, etc.”\n\nThe Greek is καὶ τοῦτο (kai touto), “and this [/ add or | exhort]\nknowing the reason, that [it is] already the hour [for us] to awake out of\nsleep.”\n1Co. 2:12.-“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the\nSpirit which is of God.”\n\nThere is no verb in this latter clause, and the verb “is” which is\nsupplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] should be in italics. But “which [cometh] from\nGod,” is better; or “is received,” repeated from the previous sentence.\n1Co. 4:20.-“For the kingdom of God {5 not in word but in power.”\nThere is no verb in the whole of this verse; consequently one must be\nsupplied:-“For the kingdom of God [is established or governed] not by\nword (or speech as in verse 19) but by power.”\n\n1Со. 14:33.-“For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as\nin all churches of the saints.” There is no verb in the latter clause,\ntherefore one must be supplied. The word “God” may also be\nrepeated as in the Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :-\n\n“For God is not [a God] of confusion, but of peace, as [He is] in all\nchurches of the saints.” Or, “as in all the churches of the saints [is well\nknown.”\n2Co. 9:14.-“And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the\nexceeding grace of God in you.” The Greek is ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν (ΕρΗ΄ humin)\nupon you, and requires the verb to be supplied, “for the exceeding\ngrace of God [bestowed] upon you.”\n2Co. 12:18.-“I desired Titus [fo go to youl, etc.”\n\nGal. 5:13.-“Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.”\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] supplies “use.” But it might well be “misuse or\nabuse.”\nEph. 4:9.-“Now that he ascended.” The Greek reads as in R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] , “Now this, He ascended.” But the\nEllipsis must be supplied: “Now, this [fact]” or “Now, this [expression],\nHe ascended, what is it unless that he also descended first into the\nlower parts of the earth?”\n\nEph. 5:9.-“For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and\nrighteousness and truth:” i.e., [consists] in these things.\n\nAll the ancient MSS. and critical texts, and the R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] agree in reading φωτός (phdtos) of the light,\ninstead of πνεύματος (pneumatos) of the Spirit, and thus “the fruits of\nthe light” are contrasted with “the unfruitful works of darkness.”\n\nPhp. 3:15.-“Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded:”\ni.e., [desire to be] perfect. There is no verb, and the word “be” ought to\nhave been put in italics.\n\n1Ti. 2:6.-“Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due\ntime.” Here there is no verb in the latter clause. The Greek reads, “the\ntestimony in due times “or in its own seasons. Hence the A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nhas boldly substituted a Verb for the noun “to be testified”; while the\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has rendered it: “the\ntestimony to be borne in its own times.” We may supply the Ellipsis\nmore fully thus: “the testimony [of which, was to be borne by us] in his\nown appointed season.”\n\nThe word “all” must be taken here in the sense of “all” without\ndistinction, because before Christ\'s death the ransom was only for one\nnation-Israel. It cannot be “all” without exception, for in that case all\nwould and must be saved. See under Synecdoche.\n\nPhilem. 6.-“[/ pray] that the communication of thy faith may become\neffectual, etc.”\n\n1Pe. 4:11.-“If any man speak, Jet him speak, as the oracles of God\n[require].\n\n2Pe. 2:3.-“Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not.” There is\nno “now” in the Greek. “Whose judgment [threatened] of old, lingereth\nnot. See Jud. 1:4.\n\n1Jn. 3:20.-“For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,\nand knoweth all things.”\n\nIn the Greek, the word ὅτι (hoti), that, occurs twice, and the\nconstruction is difficult. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] avoids it by translating the\nfirst ὅτι “for,” and ignoring the second occurrence altogether. The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] evades it by adopting for the first\nὅτι the reading (6 τι for ὅτι), which, beyond the Alexandrian Codex,\nhas scarcely any MS. support, and only that of one Textual critic\n(Lachmann). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] connects\nverse 20 with verse 10, and translates “and shall assure our heart\nbefore him, whereinsoever our heart condemn us, because God is\ngreater, &c.” But this English is as difficult as the Greek.\n\nThe difficulty is met by supplying the ellipsis before the second ὅτι,\nand translating it “that,” as it is rendered 613 times in the N.T.:-\n\n“For if our heart condemn us [we know] that God is greater than\nour heart.”\n\n(a) The Verb “to say”\n\nThis is frequently omitted in the original, but is generally supplied in\nitalics in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.]\n\nWhere it is omitted the emphasis is to be placed on what is said\nrather than on the act of saying it.\nGen. 26:7.-“Lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me.”\n1Ki. 20:34.-“Then said Ahab.”\nPsa. 2:2.-“Why do ... the rulers take counsel together against the\nLord, and against his anointed, saying.”\nPsa. 109:5.-The structure of this Psalm shows that the verb saying\nmust be supplied at the end of verse 5.\n\nΑ 1-5. David\'s prayer for himself: and complaint.\n\nВ 6-20. David\'s enemies’ words against him: (ending “that\nspeak evil against my soul.”)\n\nА 21-28-. David\'s prayer for himself: and complaint.\n\nВ -28-31. David’s enemies’ acts against him: (ending “that\ncondemn his soul.”)\n\nHere in B and B we have David’s enemies. In B (6-20) their words\nand in В (-28-31) their acts. So that verses 6-20 are not David’s words\nat all, but the words of David’s enemies, the evil which they speak\nagainst his soul. The evil which they speak is contrasted with the\n“good” which he prays for himself in the next verse (21). “Let them\ncurse,” he says in verse 28, “but bless Thou!” Let them say “let Satan\nstand at his right hand” (verse 6); but he is assured (verse 31) that not\nSatan but Jehovah shall “stand at the right hand of the poor to save\nhim from them that condemn his soul.”\n\nHence in verse 20 David prays, “Let this be the wages* [Note:\nφτμῃ (peullah), wages, as in Lev. 19:13. Isa. 40:10; Isa. 49:4; Isa.\n59:8; Isa. 52:11. Jer. 22:13.] of mine enemies from the Lord, and of\nthem that speak evil against my soul.”\nSo that verse 5 will now read:-\n“And they have rewarded me evil for good,\nAnd hatred for my good will [saying].”\nThen the Psalm goes on (verses 6-19) to describe the “hatred.”\nHaving said in verses 2 and 3 that\n“The mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are\nopened upon me.\nThey have spoken against me with a lying tongue.\nThey compassed me about also with words of hatred,”\nit is only natural to supply the verb saying at the end of verse 5.\nPsa. 144:12 is similar. The structure shows that verses 12 to 15\ncontain the words of the “strange Children,” and not the words of\nDavid.\nА1 1-7. David\'s words (Thanksgiving and Prayer).\nВ1 8. The words of the strange children (vanity and\nfalsehood).\n\nА2 9-11-. David\'s words (Thanksgiving and Prayer).\n\nB2 -11-15-. The words of the strange children (vanity and\nfalsehood).\n\nA3 -15. David’s words. The true conclusion as opposed to the\n\n“vanity.”\n\nThe word say should be put in italics after the word “that” in verse\n12, and then all the many italics inserted in verses 11-15 can be\ndispensed with. It is clearly suggested in verses 8 and 11. So clearly\nthat there is hardly any necessity to use it or repeat it in verse 12. The\npronoun ALLL (asher), who, is clearer than “that.” Lit., “who [say].”\nThen the Psalm (B.11-15-) goes on to give the vanity and the\nfalsehood as to what constitutes the true happiness of any people:-\nWho say\n\n“Our sons are as plants grown up in their youth;\n\nOur daughters are as corner-stones, polished after the\n\nsimilitude of a palace;\n\nOur garners are full, affording all manner of store;\n\nOur sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our\nstreets;\n\nOur oxen are strong to labour.\n\nThere is no breaking in nor going out.\n\nThere is no complaining in our streets.\n\nHappy people that are in such a case!”\nThen comes, in contrast, David\'s true estimate:\n\n“NO! Happy is that people whose God is Jehovah.”\n\nThis is the truth as to real happiness, as is so beautifully declared\nin Psa. 4:6-7 --\n\n“There be many that say, Who will show us good?\n\nLord, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.\n\nThou hast put gladness in my heart,\n\nMore than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.”\nYes, this is the only real “good.” This is the only source of abiding\nhappiness and gladness for any People. It is not the increase of corn\nand wine, but the light of God’s countenance; it is not the store which\nmen put in their garners, but it is the “gladness” which God puts in our\nhearts. The structure of the whole Psalm agrees with this, and indeed\nnecessitates this interpretation.\n\nSo, in Psa. 146:6, happiness is declared to consist in having the\nGod of Jacob for our help, and our hope and help in the LORD our\nGod: for there is “no help” in man (verse 3).\n\nIsa. 5:9.-“In mine ears said the Lord of hosts.”\n\nIsa. 14:8.-“Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of\nLebanon, saying.”\n\nIsa. 18:2.-“That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of\nbulrushes upon the waters, saying.”\n\nIsa. 22:13.-“And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing\nsheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: [saying] Let us eat and drink;\nfor to-morrow we shall die.”\n\nIsa. 24:14-15.-“They shall cry aloud from the sea, [saying],\nWherefore,” etc.\nIsa. 28:9.-“Whom shall he teach knowledge?” etc.\n\nThat is, “Whom [say they] shall he teach knowledge?” This verse\nand the following are the scornful words of “the scornful men”\nmentioned in verse 14. They ridicule the words of the prophet, saying,\n“for it is tsav upon tsav, tsav upon tsav, &c.,\"* [Note: See under\nParonomasia.] not “must be” but “it is.”\n\nThen, in verse 11, the prophet answers “For,” or “Yea, verily, with\nstammerings of lip and another (or foreign) tongue will he speak to this\npeople,” and he tells them why “the word of the Lord was unto them\nprecept upon precept;” viz. (verse 13), that they might fall and be\nbroken.\n\nJer. 9:19.-“For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, [saying], How\nare we spoiled!”\n\nJer. 11:19.-“I knew not that they had devised devices against me,\nsaying.”\n\nJer. 50:5.-“They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,\nsaying.”\n\nLam. 3:41.-“Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the\nheavens, [saying].”\nHos. 14:8.-“Ephraim shall say,” etc.\nAct. 9:6.-“And the Lord said unto him,” etc.\nAct. 10:15.-“And the voice spake unto him again the second time.”\nAct. 14:22.-“Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them\nto continue in the faith, and saying that we must through much\ntribulation enter into the kingdom of God.”\n2Co. 12:16.-“But be it so, | did not burden you: nevertheless [you say\nthat] being crafty, | caught you with guile.”\n\n2. When the Infinitive of the verb is wanting:\n\n(a) After the Hebrew vim γ8ΗΚόΗ able\n\nPsa. 21:11.-“They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not\nable to perform.”\nPsa. 101:5.-“Him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not |\nsuffer,” i.e., | ат not able {ο bear.\nIsa. 1:13.-“The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, |\ncannot away with,” i.e., | am not able {ο endure. See Jer. 44:22.\nPsa. 139:6.-“Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, |\ncannot attain unto it.” Here the Ellipsis is properly supplied: i.e., | am\nnot able fo attain unto it.\nHos. 8:5.-“How long will it be ere they attain to innocency?” i.e., how\nlong ere they are able {ο practise innocency?\n1Со. 3:2.-Ч have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye\nwere not able to bear it,” i.e., to eat, or partake of it, or, to digest it.\n\n(b) After the verb to finish\n1Sa. 16:11.-“Are here all thy children?” Here the Ellipsis is avoided by\na free and idiomatic translation. The Heb. reads, “Have the young men\nfinished?” i.e., “Are the young men finished passing by?” or done\npassing before me?\nMat. 10:23.-“Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son\nof Man be come.” Lit. “Ye will not have finished going over the cities,”\netc., referring to verses 6 and 7.\nMat. 13:53.-“When Jesus had finished these parables,” i.e., when\nJesus had finished speaking these parables.\n(c) When the INFINITIVE is wanting after another verb, personal\nor impersonal\n\nGen. 9:20.-“And Noah began to be an husbandman,” or, “And Noah\nthe husbandman began and planted, etc.”\n1Ki. 7:47.-“And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they\nwere exceeding many,” i.e., and Solomon omitted to weigh, etc.\nPro. 21:5.-“The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness:\nbut of every one that is hasty only to want.”\n\nHere plenteousness is ОеЪШ (méthar) that which is over and\nabove, excess, (from ὕμιι (yahthar) to be superfluous).\n\n“The thoughts of the diligent tend only to excess, and [the\nthoughts] of every one that hasteth [fo get riches tend] only to want.”\nThe Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies the Ellipses\nthus. “But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want’; “hasting to\nwant’ is very obscure, but the “hasting to get riches” tending to want is\nclear.\n\nMar. 15:8.-“And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do\nas he had ever done unto them,” i.e., that he should do.\n\nLuk. 13:33.-“Nevertheless | must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the\nday following,” etc.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “Howbeit | must\ngo on my way.” But the Greek is “Howbeit it behoves me to-day, and\nto-morrow, and the day following, to go on [to work],” i.e., to continue\nworking.\n\nRom. 4:25.-“Who was delivered [to die] for our offences.”\n\n3. When the Verb Substantive is omitted\nThe Hebrew having no verb substantive, this is generally expressed in\nitalics in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] But inasmuch as it is absolutely necessary for\nthe sense in English, the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has\nprinted it in roman type. (See preface to R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] );\nGen. 1:2.-“Darkness was upon the face of the deep.”\nGen. 2:10.-Lit. “And there was a river going out of Eden.”\nGen. 3:6.-“And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,\nand that it was pleasant to the eyes,” etc.\nGen. 4:13.-“My punishment is greater than | can bear.”\nGen. 5:1.-“This is the book of the generations of Adam.”\nNum. 14:9.-“Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the\npeople of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed\nfrom them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.”\nThese are the words of Joshua and Caleb to the people to\nencourage them to go up in spite of the false report of the other spies.\nNote first the marginal rendering of the word “defence.” It is given\n“Heb. shadow,” i.e., “Their shadow is departed.” So in the R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] the word “shadow’ is treated as though it\nwere a figure (Metonymy). The literal meaning of the word is departed\nfrom, as well as the literal rendering of the preceding sentence. This is\nOn мдоре (kee lachmenoo) “for they are our bread.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, i.e., our bread\naptly represents their condition.\nWhat was their “bread”? It was manna. What was the manna like?\nIt was most marvellous bread, for it was so hard that it had to be\nground in mills, or beaten in a mortar (Num. 11:8); and yet its\nconsistency was so peculiar that it melted in the sun! (Exo. 16:21). If it\nwere not gathered every morning before the sun arose and the\nshadows departed, “when the sun waxed hot, it melted”!* [Note:\nMarvellous bread indeed! A standing miracle, both as to the manner in\nwhich it was given, and also as to its consistency. Bread indeed, hard,\nand yet melting like ice in the sun.]\n\nThe wicked spies had just said (Num. 13:31) that Israel could not\ngo up against the people of the land, for they are “stronger than we”:\nthey were strong and hard. No, replies Joshua, it may be they are\nstrong, but so is our bread the manna-so strong that it needs grinding\nand crushing, and yet, when the shadow goes from off it, it melts\naway. Even so is it with them, as the words of Rahab testify (Jos.\n2:11). The two spies whom Joshua afterwards sent heard the very\nsame truth from the lips of Rahab, which he, one of the two faithful\nspies whom Moses had sent, forty years before declared. She tells\nthem:-“As soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,\nneither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of\nyou.”\nThus, while the literal signification of the words gives no sense,\nthey point to the true figure; and then, in turn, the figure explains the\nliteral signification of the words, and the true meaning of the passage.\nSo that we may render it thus:-“Only rebel not ye against Jehovah,\nneither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are like] our bread;\ntheir shadow hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah is with us;\nfear them not,” ᾖ8., as when the shadow turns aside from off our\nbread, it melts away and disappears, so these enemies, hard and\nstrong as they might be, would surely melt away before the Lord God,\nthe Sun and the Shield of His people. In no sense could Jehovah be\nthe shadow or defence of the people of the land against whom Israel\nwas about to fight.\n1Sa. 19:11.-“To-morrow thou shalt be slain.”\n2Ki. 6:33.-“Behold, this evil is of the Lord.”\n2Ch. 3:9.-“And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.”\n\nThe verb is omitted to show that the emphasis is on the “nails” and\ntheir “weight.” And what a wonderful emphasis it is! For in all the\nrequirements for “the house of God,” the fir-trees, the fine gold, the\nprecious stones, the beams, the posts, the walls, etc., are mentioned;\nyet, the “nails” that held all together are not omitted. Though they were\nsmall, yet God used them: though out of sight, they were necessary.\nPsa. 33:4.-“For the word of the Lord is right.”\nPsa. 99:9.-“For the Lord our God is holy.”\n\nIt is worthy of note that there are three Psalms which begin with\nthe words: “The Lord reigneth,” viz., xciii., xcvii., and xcix. They each\nend with a reference to holiness.\n\nPsa. 93:1-5 “Holiness becometh Thine house, O Lord, for ever.”\n\nPsa. 97:1-12 “Give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.”\n\nPsa. 99:1-9 The third Psalm, three times:\n\nVerse 3. “It is holy.”\nVerse 5. “He is holy.”\nVerse 9. “The Lord our God is holy.”\nTo those who have ears to hear, this plainly declares that when the\nLord shall reign, all will be holy; that when His kingdom comes, His\nname will be hallowed on earth as it is in heaven. “In that day shall\nthere be upon the bells (or bridles) of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO\nTHE LORD; and the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls\nbefore the altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be\nHOLINESS unto the Lord of hosts” (Zec. 14:20-21). “Her merchandise\nand her hire shall be holiness to the Lord” (Isa. 23:18).\n\nThe cry of the living creatures (Rev. 4:8, etc.) is “Holy, holy, holy,”\nand their call is for the judgments which will issue in the Lord’s reign,\nwhich is celebrated in these three Psalms. Those who teach that the\nCherubim (or the Cherubs) are the Church fail to see that their chief\nfunction is to call for judgment!\n\nPsa. 119:89.-“For ever, O Lord.” The verb must here be supplied. The\nverb in the parallel line answers to the verb here:-\n\n“For ever [art Thou] O Lord;\n\nThy word is settled in heaven.\n\nThy faithfulness is unto all generations;\n\nThou hast established the earth, and it abideth.”\nIn the first and third lines, we have Jehovah. In the second and\n\nfourth lines, we have what He has settled and established.\n\nEcc. 7:12.-“Wisdom is a defence.”\n\nIsa. 43:25.-Ч, even |, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for\nmine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.”\n\nWe may take this in connection with Psa. 103:14. “For he knoweth\nour frame; he remembereth that we are dust.”\n\nHere the verbs are omitted to throw the emphasis on the persons,\nrather than on the acts. This points us to Jehovah in the former\npassage, and ourselves in the latter-His Deity, and our vanity-and to\ncontrast His thoughts with our thoughts, His ways with our ways. God\nremembers our infirmities; but this is the very thing that man will not\nremember! Man will make no allowance for our infirmities. On the\nother hand, man will remember our sins. Let any one of us fall into sin,\nand many will remember it after many years: but this is what God says\nHe will not remember! “Their sins and their iniquities will | remember\nno more.” He is Jehovah, we are dust! Hence our sins, which man\nremembers, God will forget; but our infirmities, which man forgets,\nGod will remember. Blessed be God!\n\nIsa. 44:6.-“I am the first and | am the last, and beside me there is no\nGod.”\nEze. 34:17.-“And as for you.”\n\nThe Ellipses of this passage may be thus supplied: “And ye, O my\nflock, thus saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah): Behold, | judge\nbetween cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. [/s if] a\nsmall thing to you [goats] to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye\nmust tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to\nhave drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your\nfeet? And [is it a small thing that] my flock [i.e., my sheep] eat [or must\neat] that which ye [goats] have trodden with your feet; and drink that\nwhich ye have fouled with your feet?”\n\nThe contrast is between the sheep and the goats. Sheep never\nbecome goats, and goats never become sheep, either in nature or in\ngrace. The Chief Shepherd knows His sheep here; He separates them\nnow, and will eternally separate them from the goats in the coming\nday, when He shall “save his flock, and judge between cattle and\ncattle” (verses 20, 22, 23).\nThe characteristic of the goat alluded to here, is graphically set\nforth in a paper read before the Victoria Institute, Feb. 1, 1892, by J.W.\nSlater, Esq., F.C.S., F.E.S. He says, “The native flora and fauna of St.\nHelena have been practically extirpated by the goat. These young\nseedlings were browsed down as fast as they sprung up, and when\nthe old giants of the forest decayed there were no successors to take\ntheir place. As a necessary consequence, the insects and birds\ndisappeared in turn. The same horned wretch’-fit type of evil-which, as\nSir Joseph Hooker shows, has ravaged the earth to a greater extent\nthan man has done by war, is now in the very same manner laying\nwaste South Africa. To such an extent has the mischief already been\ncarried, that a troop of the Colonial Cavalry on the march actually\ngave three cheers on meeting a tree!”\n\nHave we not here a fit illustration of Eze. 34:1-31? And may we not\nsee in ecclesiastical affairs around us (through the unfaithfulness of\nthe shepherds) the ravages of the “goats” in treading down and laying\nwaste, and fouling the pastures of the flock of God? The goats have\nturned our churches and chapels into places of amusement and of\nmusical entertainment, where they may have “pleasant afternoons,”\nand “make provision for the flesh”; so much so that the. Lord’s sheep\nare “pushed” and “scattered,” and scarcely know where to find the\n“green pastures” and the “living waters” of the pure Word of God and\nthe Gospel of His grace! Thank God, the Chief Shepherd is coming:\nand, when He comes, though He will scarcely “find faith on the earth”\n(Luk. 18:8), He will “save His flock” and separate them from the goats\nfor ever, and be their One True Shepherd.\n\nLuk. 2:14.-“Glory to God in the highest,” i.e., Glory be to God in the\nhighest.\n\nLuk. 22:21.-\"The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the\ntable.”\n\nJoh. 4:24.-“God is a Spirit.”\n\nSee under Hendiadys and Hyperbaton.\n\nAct. 2:29.-“Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the\npatriarch David.”\n\nHere the verb “speak” is the infinitive: /it., “to speak,” and “let me”\nis the present participle (ἐξόν, exon),* [Note: €??? (exon) occurs only\nthree times, of these the first (Mat. 12:4) has ?? (een), was, after it;\nwhile in the other two places (here, and 2Co. 12:4) it stands alone. In\n2Co. 12:4 it seems plain that we must supply ¢???? (estin), is; and so\nprobably we should do here.] permitted or allowed. So that we must\nsupply the verb substantive (ἔστω, esto), let me be:-“[let me be]\npermitted to speak freely unto you, or / am, or may be, permitted, etc.”\n1Со. 6:13.-“Meats [are] for the belly, and the belly [/s] for meats.”\n1Со. 15:29.-“Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,\nif the dead rise not at all?”\nThis passage has been supposed to refer to a practice which\nobtained even in those apostolic days of persons being baptized on\nbehalf of and for the spiritual benefit of those who were already dead.\nAs this practice thus receives a tacit approval, and yet is destitute of\nany historical evidence as to its existence, apart from this passage,\nvarious methods have been proposed of meeting the difficulty which is\nthus raised. Some have erroneously suggested that “the dead” refers\nto Christ: but they have done so in ignorance of the fact that the word\nis plural, as is clearly shown by the verb “rise.” Others (with\nMacknight) suggest the supply of the words “resurrection of’-“What\nshall they do which are baptized for the [resurrection of] the dead?”\nBut this implies the omission of the very word which is most essential\nto the argument; and would be a form of Ellipsis seldom, if ever, found.\nThere are a multitude of other explanations; but the true solution of the\ndifficulty is (we submit) to be sought in punctuation, and in the correct\nsupply of the Ellipsis.\n\nWe must bear in mind that there is no punctuation in the ancient\nmanuscripts, beyond the greater pauses. All interpunctuation is purely\nhuman in its origin, and we may be thankful that it is so seldom\nnecessary to question its accuracy. We have also to note the structure\nof the whole context, for this, like all other texts, must be interpreted in\nharmony with the scope of the whole passage, and with the design of\nthe whole argument.\nThe following is the structure of 1Co. 15:12-58.* [Note: The first\neleven verses are constructed as follows:-\nD 1-. The apostle’s declaration.\nЕ -1, 2. The Gospel he preached.\nР 3-. The apostle’s declaration.\nЕ 3-11. The Gospel he received.]\nΑ 12. The difficulty stated (as to the fact). “How?”\nВ 13-32.

If Christ not risen.\nConsequences:\nOur preaching vain.\nYour faith vain.\nWe false witnesses.\nο 16. If no resurrection: Consequence-then Christ is not\nrisen.\nα 17, 18. If Christ not risen.\nConsequences:\nYour faith vain.\nYe yet in sins.\nThe dead perished.\nThe structure of “A” and “B” (verses 35-57). The difficulty stated.\nA е 35. Question: How are the dead raised up?\nf 395. Question: With what body do they come?\nB # 36-49. Answer to “f.”\ne 50-57. Answer to “e.”\nThe structure therefore of this chapter shows that verses 20-28\n(“a”) are placed, practically, in a parenthesis, so that this 29th verse\nreads on from the 19th verse, and continues the argument thus:-“17. If\nChrist be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 18.\nThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 19. If in\nthis life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.\n29. Else what shall they do which are being baptized?”* [Note: Alford\n(who arrives at a very different conclusion) points out that\nοἱ βαπιζόµενοι (hoi baptizomenci) is the present participle and not the\npast, i.e., those who are being baptized. He observes: “The distinction\nis important as affecting the interpretation.”]\n\nBut here comes in the matter of punctuation. In. Rom. 8:34 we\nhave a very similar construction, which, if we treat it as 1Co. 15:29 is\ntreated in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n, would read thus, “Who is he that condemneth Christ that died?” But\nthe question is made to end at the word “condemneth,” and the\nEllipsis of the verb substantive is supplied thus:-“Who is he that\ncondemneth? /t is Christ that died” (or better, “/s it Christ who died?”\nSee below). Now if we treat 1Co. 15:29 in the same manner, it will\nread, “What shall they do which are being baptized? /t is on behalf of\nthe dead if the dead rise not at all!”\nFrom Rom. 6:1-23 we learn that our circumcision is in Christ\'s\ndeath, our baptism is in Christ\'s burial. “Buried with Him by the\nbaptism of Him, (i.e., by His baptism-unto-death)’; and if He is not\nraised, we cannot be raised, Rom. 6:4. (See above, pages 18, 19).\n“Buried with Him in the baptism of him,” i.e., His baptism (Col.\n2:11-12).\n\nTherefore if Christ be not raised, we are not raised in Him, and our\nbaptism is for the dead.\n\nWhenever we have the word νεκρός (nekros), dead, with the\narticle (as it is here in 1Co. 15:29), it always denotes dead bodies,\ncorpses. (See Gen. 23:3-6; Gen. 23:8; Gen. 23:13; Gen. 23:15. Deu.\n28:26. Jer. 12:33. Eze. 37:19. Luk. 24:5.) On the contrary, when it is\nwithout the article it denotes the persons who are dead, dead people.\n(See Deu. 14:1. Mat. 22:33. Mar. 9:10. Luk. 16:30-31; Luk. 24:46. Joh.\n20:9. Act. 10:41; Act. 26:23. Rom. 6:13; Rom. 10:7; Rom. 11:15. Heb.\n11:19; Heb. 13:20).\n\nSo that this is an additional argument why, if Christ be not raised,\nand we are buried with Him, then baptism is in the interest of those\nwho are to remain dead corpses, and not of risen ones, raised with\nChrist.\nThis is the force of the word ὑπέρ (hyper). Like the English “for,” it\ndenotes the object of interest, not merely the subject, and ranges from\nmere reference to actual substitution, e.g., 2Co. 8:23, “Whether any\nenquire about Titus”; Mat. 5:44, “Pray for those who persecute you”;\nMar. 9:40, “He who is not against us is for us”; 2Co. 1:6, “Whether we\nbe afflicted, it is for your consolation”; Philem. 13, “That he might\nminister to me instead of thee.”* [Note: See also Rom. 9:27. 20ο.\n1:11; 2Co. 8:23-24. 2Th. 2:1. Col. 1:7.]\n\nIf Christ be not raised, well may those who are being baptized into\nChrist\'s burial be asked, “What shall they do?” Truly, “Е is for the\ndead.” For they will remain dead, as corpses. In this life they “die\ndaily” (verse 31); in death they perish (verse 18); and are thus “of all\nmen most miserable” (verse 19).\n“What shall they do who are being baptized? /t is for the dead if\nthe dead rise not at all!” It is to remain dead, as corpses, without hope\nof resurrection.\n\nThus, the expression, “baptized for the dead,” vanishes from the\nScripture, and is banished from theology; for the assumed practice is\ngathered only from this passage, and is unknown to history apart from\nit.\n1Co. 15:48.-“As is the earthy [man, Adam] such [shall be] also they\nthat are earthy; and as is the heavenly [man, the Lord] such [shall be]\nthey also that are heavenly.”\n\nThis is clear from the verse that follows:-“And as we have borne\nthe image of the earthy [man, Adam] we shall also bear the image of\nthe heavenly [man, the Lord].” See Php. 3:21.\n\n2Co. 11:22.-“Are they Hebrews? So am,” etc.\n\nEph. 3:1.-“For this cause | Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you\nGentiles,” {6., “I Paul [am] the prisoner,” etc.\n\nPhp. 4:16.-“For even [when / was] in Thessalonica ye sent once and\nagain unto my necessity.”\n2Ti. 3:16.-“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is\nprofitable.”t [Note: See this passage also under the figures of\nAsyndeton and Paregmenon.]\n\nWith this we may take eight other passages, where we have the\nsame construction: viz., Rom. 7:12. 1Co. 11:30. 2Co. 10:10. 1Ti. 1:15;\n1Ti. 2:3; 1Ti. 4:4; 1Ti. 4:9. and Heb. 4:13.\n\nThese nine passages may be taken together, and considered in\ntheir bearing on the translation of 2Ti. 3:16 in the Revised Version,\nwhich is as follows:-\n\n“Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable,” etc.\n\nIn each of these passages we have the very same Greek\nconstruction, and four of them are in the Epistles to Timothy. The A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] translates all these nine passages in precisely the same way,\nand on the same principles. But the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] translates eight of them in one way ({6., like the A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ),\nwhile it renders one on quite a different principle.\n\nHere are the passages, and the rendering as in the Authorized\nVersion:-\nRom. 7:12.\n\nἡ ἐντολὴ The commandment\nis\n\nayia holy\n\nkal and\n\nбикайа just.\n1Co. 11:30.\nπολλοϊ many\nare\n\nἀσθενεῖς weak\nkal and\nἄῤῥωστοι sickly.\n2Co. 10:10.\nἐπιστολαί his letters\nare\n\nβαρεῖαι weighty\nkal and\n\nioxupai powerful.\n1Ti. 1:15; 1Ti. 4:9.\nπιστὸς faithful\n\nis\n\nὁ λόγος the saying\nkal and\nπάσης ἁποδοχῆς ἄξιος worthy of all acceptation.\n(Ti. 2:3.\n\nτοῦτο this\n\nis\n\nκαλόν good\n\nkal and\n\nἀπόδεκτον acceptable.\n\n1Ti. 4:4.\n\nπᾶν κῄσµα Θεου Every creature of God\nis\n\nκαλόν good\n\nkal and\nοὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον nothing to be refused.\n2Ti. 3:16.\n\nπᾶσα γραφὴ All Scripture\n\nis\n\nΘεόπνευστος given by inspiration of God\nkal and\n\nὠφέλιμος is profitable.\n\nHeb. 4:13.\n\nπάντα All things\n\nare\n\nγυμνὰ naked\n\nkal and\nτετραχηλισµένα Opened.\n\nNow the case stands thus. The Revisers have translated eight of\nthese passages, which we have cited, on the same principles as the\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , ie., supplying in italics the verb substantive “is” and\n“are” respectively, and taking the copulative kai, “and,” as joining\ntogether the two predicates. But when the Revisers come to the ninth\npassage (2Ti. 3:16), they separate the two conjoined predicates,\nmaking the first a part of the subject, and then are obliged to translate\nthe kai in the sense of “also,” when there is nothing antecedent to it.\nThus:-\n\n“Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable.”\nNow, if the Revisers had translated the other eight passages in the\nsame way, the renderings would have been consistent, whatever else\nthey might not have been.\n\nRom. 7:12 would have been-\n\n“The holy commandment is also just.”\n1Co. 11:30 would have been-\n\n“Many weak ones are also sickly.”\n2Co. 10:10 would have been-\n\n“His weighty letters are also powerful.”\n\n1Ti. 1:15; 1Ti. 4:9 would have been-\n\n“The faithful saying is also worthy of all acceptation.”\n1Ti. 2:3 would have been-\n\n“This good thing is also acceptable.”\n1Ti. 4:4 would have been-\n“Every good creature of God {5 also nothing to be refused.”\n\nHeb. 4:13 would have been-\n\n“All naked things are also opened,” etc.\n\nBut the Revisers do not translate them thus! And the fact that they\nrender the whole of these eight passages as in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ and\nsingle out 2Ti. 3:16 for different treatment, forbids us to accept the\ninconsistent rendering, and deprives it of all authority. Without\ninquiring as to what the motives of the Revisers may have been, we\nare justified in regretting that this should be the passage singled out\nfor this inconsistent and exceptional treatment, reducing it to a mere\nplatitude. It is only fair to add that the correct rendering of the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] is given in the margin.\n\nPhilem. 11.-“Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now [is]\nprofitable to thee and to me.”\n4. When the Participle is wanting\nNum. 24:19.-” Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is more literal:-“And\nout of Jacob shall one have dominion.”\n\nThe Heb. is simply:-“And one shall rule (or have dominion) out of\nJacob.”\n\nThe Ellipsis of the participle being supplied, it reads:-“And one\nshall rule [being born] out of Jacob.”\n1Sa. 15:7.-“And Saul smote the Amalekites [dwelling] from Havilah\nunto Shur.”\n\nThis refers to the region occupied by the Amalekites, and not to\nthe people smitten, as is clear from chap. 30.\nIsa. 57:8.-“Thou hast discovered thyself to another than me,” i.e.,\n“thou hast discovered thyself, departing from me,” oabi (meittee).\nEze. 11:11.-‘This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the\nflesh in the midst thereof; but | will judge you [scattered] in the border\nof Israel.”\nMar. 7:4.-“And [on coming] from the market, they eat not except they\nwash.”\nMar. 7:17.-“And when he was entered into the house [getting away]\nfrom the people.”\nAct. 13:20.-“And after that he gave unto them judges about the space\nof 450 years.” Lit., “After these things [were done],” i.e., after the\ndivision of the land by Joshua.* [Note: For the question as to the\nChronology involved in this difficulty, see Number in Scripture, by the\nsame author and publisher, page 5.]\n2Th. 1:9.-“Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [driven\nout] from the presence of the Lord.”\nHeb. 2:3.-“Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was\nconfirmed unto us by them that heard him,” i.e., “which at the first\nbegan to be spoken by the Lord, and, [being brought] unto us by them\nthat heard him, was confirmed,” etc.\n\nIll. When Certain Connected Words are omitted in the same\n\nMember of a Passage\nThis particular form of Ellipsis has a distinct name, BRACHYLOGIA\n(BpaxuAoyia from βραχύς, brachus, short, and λόγος, logos,\ndiscourse), English, Bra-chyl-o-gy. Or from the Latin,\nBRE VILOQUENCE, it means brevity of speech or writing, and is\nused of an Ellipsis, in which words are omitted chiefly for the sake of\nbrevity; which words may easily be supplied from the nature of the\nsubject.\n\nGen. 25:32.-“And Esau said, Behold, | am at the point to die; and what\nprofit shall this birthright do to me?” There must be supplied, the\nthought, if not the words:-“I will sell it.” So with the next verse. “And\nJacob said, Swear to me this day [that thou wilt sell it me]; and he\nsware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.”\n\nGen. 45:12.-“And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother\nBenjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.” Lit., it is,\n“because my mouth σὐοφή, kee phee) is speaking unto you.” If\nwe supply the Ellipsis, we may retain this literal rendering.\n\nJoseph had been speaking of his glory (verse 8): but, on the\nprinciple of Pro. 27:2 : “Let another man praise thee, and not thine\nown mouth,” he breaks off and says, “Now, behold, your eyes are\nseeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin; because my own mouth\nis speaking unto you [/ cannot speak of all my glory], but ye shall\ndeclare to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all that ye have seen,”\ni.e., They were to describe what he could not well say of himself.\n\n2Ki. 19:9.-“And when he had heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,\nBehold, he is come out to fight against thee: [he turned his army\nagainst him; and, having conquered him, he returned to Jerusalem,\nand] he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah.”\n\n2Ki. 22:18.-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As touching the words\nwhich thou hast heard.”\n\nSo the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] but without italics.\nBut surely the sense is:-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The words\nwhich thou (Josiah) hast heard [shall surely come to pass, buf]\nbecause thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself,” etc.\n... ‘thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes\nshall not see all the evil which | will bring upon this place.”\n1Ch. 18:10.-“He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his\nwelfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against\nHadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and\nwith him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies “and he had\nwith him.” But the Ellipsis is to be supplied from 2Sa. 8:10, thus, “And\nall manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass were in his hand”\n(ήτο Πὔε).\nEze. 47:13.-“Joseph shall have two portions,” i.e., shall inherit.\nMat. 21:22.-“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,\nye shall receive,” i.e., add “if it be His will.” Compare Mat. 26:39-44;\nJos. 5:14-15; 1Jn. 5:14-15. This is the one abiding condition of all real\nprayer, and the Ellipsis must be thus supplied wherever it is found.\nIn Mar. 5:1-43 we have by way of illustration three prayers-\n1. In verses 12, 13. “The devils besought him,” and “Jesus gave\nthem leave.”\n2. In verse 17. The Gadarenes “began to pray him to depart out\nof their coasts.” And Jesus left them.\n3. In verses 18, 19. “He that had been possessed with the devil\nprayed him that he might be with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered\nhim not.”\n“No!” is an answer to prayer | and often, very often, a most\ngracious and loving answer too. No greater calamity could come upon\nus than for God to answer “Yes” to all our ignorant requests. Better to\nhave our prayers refused with this man who had been the subject of\nHis grace and love and power, than to have them answered with\nDevils and Gadarenes.\n\nMat. 25:9.-“But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not\nenough for us and you;” i.e., “But the wise answered, By no means,\nfor look, there will not be enough, &c., or we cannot give to you, lest,\n&с.”\n\nMar. 14:49.-“But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.” The Greek is, “But\nthat the Scriptures may be fulfilled.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, “But this is done that\nthe Scriptures should be fulfilled.” (Compare Mat. 26:56.)\n\nLuk. 7:43.-“Simon answered and said, | suppose that he to whom he\nforgave most [will love him mosf].”\n\nJoh. 2:18.-“What sign showest thou unto us [that thou art the\nMessiah], seeing that thou doest these things?” As in Jdg. 6:17,\nGideon says, “Show me a sign that thou [art Jehovah that] talkest with\nme.”\nJoh. 7:38.-“He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of\nhis belly shall flow rivers of living water.”\n\nThe difficulties of this verse are great, as may be seen by a\nreference to the commentators. It will be noted that a comparison is\nsuggested by the word καθώς (kathds), like as, and that there is an\nEllipsis which must be supplied. Bengel suggests “as the Scripture\nhath said so it shall be,” or “so shall it be.” But something more is\nevidently required. Is there not a reference to the Haphtarah, i.e., the\nportion selected (from the Prophets) as the lesson to be read on the\nfirst day of the Feast of Tabernacles, which was Zec. 14:1-21?* [Note:\nThe portion from the Law (Act. 13:15) read in conjunction with this was\nLev. 22:26-33; Lev. 23:1-44; with Num. 29:12-16.] The Lord was not\npresent then, for it was not until “the midst of the feast” that He went\nup (verse 14). But in “the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus\nstood and cried,” with evident reference to the Scripture which had\nbeen read, “He that believeth on me (as the Scripture hath said\n[concerning Jerusalem: so shall it be]) out of his heart rivers of living\nwater shall flow.” What the Scripture had said concerning Jerusalem in\nZec. 14:8 was this:-“And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall\ngo out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of\nthem toward the hinder sea,” &c. To this agree the words of the\nprophecy in Eze. 47:1-11. These prophecies shall yet be literally\nfulfilled with regard to Jerusalem: and what will then actually take place\nillustrates what takes place now in the experience of every one who\nbelieves in Jesus. Even as those rivers will flow forth from Jerusalem\nin that day, so now the Holy Spirit, in all His wondrous powers, and\ngifts, and graces, flows forth from the inward parts-the new nature of\nthe believer.\n\nJoh. 13:18.-“I speak not of you all: | know whom | have chosen: but [/\nhave done this] that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth\nbread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.” Compare verses\n26-30.\nJoh. 15:25.-“But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled\nthat is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.” The\nabbreviated expression emphasizes the statement to which we are\nthus hastened on. And our attention is called to the fact that δωρεάν\n(абгеап) here rendered “without a cause” is in Rom. 3:24 rendered\n“freely.”-“Being justified freely by his grace”: /.е., there was no more\ncause why we should be “justified” than there was why Jesus should\nbe “hated”!\n\nJoh. 15:27.-“Ye have been with me from the beginning [and are still\nwith me].” Compare 16:4, and see 1Jn. 3:8 below.\n\nRom. 9:16.-Here the reference is to Esau and Jacob, spoken of in\nverses 10-13, and to the history as recorded in Gen. 27:3-4.\n\n“So then [election is] not of him who willeth [as /заас wished to\nbless Esau according to “the will of the flesh’* [Note: As Jacob was\nasked to bless Ephraim and Manasseh according to “the will of man”\n(Joseph) (Gen. 48:7-14). Both cases are instanced in Heb. 11:20-21\nas acts of “Faith,” i.e., faith’s exercise of gifts contrary to “the will of the\nflesh,” as in the case of Isaac; and contrary to “the will of man” in the\ncase of Jacob.] ], nor of him that runneth [as Esau ran for venison that\nhis father might eat, and bless him], but of God who showeth mercy.”\n1Co. 9:4.-“Have we not power to eat and to drink [at the expense of\nour converts or of the Church]?” Without this there is no sequence in\nthe apostle’s argument. Or we may supply [without working with our\nown hands], see verses 6 and 7.\n20ο. 5:3.-“If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.”\n\nHere the blessed hope of Resurrection is described as being\nclothed upon with the heavenly body. This is the subject which\ncommences at 2Co. 4:14. In chap. 5:3 the kai is ignored in both A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] The Greek is, “If\nindeed BEING CLOTHED also, we shall not be found naked [as some\namong you say].” There were some among the Corinthians who said\n“there is no resurrection of the dead” (1Co. 15:12; 1Co. 15:35), and\nhere those assertions are thus referred to.\nGal. 2:9.-“They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of\nfellowship; that we unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision,\n[should carry the apostolic message and decrees].”\nEph. 4:29.-Here the word εἰ (ei) if is omitted in the translation both in\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] Not\nobserving the Ellipsis, the word “if? was omitted to make sense.\n\nWith the “if” retained, the Ellipsis is properly supplied thus:-\n“Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but, if\nany [speech be] good to the use of edifying, [/et it be spoken] that it\nmay minister grace unto the hearers.”\n\nPhp. 4:11.-“I have learned in whatsoever state | am, therewith to be\ncontent.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads “therein to be\ncontent,” without italics. But what is he to be content with? Surely not\ncontent with the circumstances, but with the will of God. So that the\nverse will read, “I have learned, in whatsoever state | am, to be\ncontent with [the will of Goa].”\n1Jn. 3:8.-“The devil sinneth from the beginning [and still sinneth].”\n\nIV. When a Whole Clause is omitted in a Connected Passage\n\n1. When the first member of a clause is omitted\nMat. 16:7.-“And they reasoned among themselves, saying, /t is\nbecause we have taken no bread.”\nHere the first member of the latter clause is wanting. It is supplied\nin the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] by the words “It is.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , not seeing this Ellipsis, has boldly omitted the oti\n(hoti) because, and_ translated:-“And they reasoned among\nthemselves, saying, We took no bread” (giving the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in the\nmargin).\n\nThe Ellipsis of the first member is properly filled up thus:-“And they\nreasoned among themselves, saying [Jesus spoke thus, verse 6],\nbecause we have taken no bread.”\n\nSee further under Hypocatastasis.\n\nMar. 3:30.-“Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.” Here the\nfirst clause is omitted:-“[Jesus said this unto them], because they said,\nHe hath an unclean spirit.”\n\nLuk. 9:13.-“He said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said,\nWe have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go\nand buy meat for all this people.”\n\nThere is something wanting here, which may be thus\nsupplied:-“We have no more than five loaves and two fishes;\n[therefore we are not able to give to them to eat] except we should go\nand buy meat for all this people.”\n\nJoh. 5:7.-“The impotent man answered him, Sir, [/ am indeed willing,\nbut], | have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the\npool,” etc.\n\n2Th. 2:3.-“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall\nnot come, except there come a falling away first.” (Lit., the apostasy.)\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] fills up the Ellipsis of the\nprior member, by the words “it will not be,” which is weak and tame\ncompared with the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nWhat is referred to is the day of the Lord,* [Note: Not “the day of\nChrist,” as in A.V. The R.V. and the Ancient mss. and Critical Texts\nread correctly “the day of the Lord.”] mentioned in the preceding\nverse. “Let no man deceive you by any means: for [the day of the Lord\nshall not come] except there come the falling away first:” i.e., the great\napostasy, which is the subject of many prophecies, must precede the\nday of the Lord. But it does not precede the day of Christ. Hence the\nsaints in Thessalonica might well be troubled if the day of the Lord had\nset in, and they had not been previously gathered together to meet the\nLord in the air in the day of Christ, as had been promised (1Th.\n4:16-17; 2Th. 2:1).¢ [Note: See Four Prophetic Periods, by the same\nauthor and publisher.]\n\nThis is not the popular teaching, but it is the truth of God. Popular\ntheology is very different. It says, “That day cannot come until the\nworld’s conversion comes.” The Scripture says it cannot come until\nthe apostasy shall have come. Popular theology says the world is not\ngood enough yet for Christ to come. The Scripture teaches that the\nworld is not yet bad enough! The Thessalonian saints believed their\nteachers, and are an example for all time for holiness of walk and for\nmissionary zeal. People to-day believe their teachers, and all men see\ntheir works!\n\n2. The Ellipsis of a latter clause, called Anantapodoton, i.e.,\n\nwithout apodosis*\n\n[Note: Apodosis, Greek a???????, a giving back again: hence, it is\nthe consequent clause. The former clause is called the Protasis\n(22222222, to stretch before).]\n\nIt is a hypothetical proposition without the consequent clause.\nGen. 30:27.-“And Laban said unto him, | pray thee, if | have found\nfavour in thine eyes [remain with me: for] | have learned by experience\nthat the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.”\n2Sa. 2:27.-“And Joab said [to Abner], As God liveth, unless thou hadst\nspoken [the words which gave the provocation (see verse 14)], surely\nthen in the morning the people had gone up (marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] gone away) every one from following his brother.”\n2Sa. 5:6-8.-The Ellipsis here involves a retranslation of this difficult\npassage:-“And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, unto the\nJebusites, the inhabitants of the land: Which spake unto David,\nsaying,t [Note: Both the A.V. and the Π.Ν. transpose the following two\nsentences.] Thou shalt not come in hither, for (or but, nn aH, kee\neem, see Psa. 1:3-4; ‘for, Pro. 23:18; Lam. 5:22) the blind and lame\nshall drive thee away (so Coverdale) by saying (МаОШ, /aimér,\nsaying, margin), David shall not come in hither. Nevertheless, David\ntook the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. And David\nsaid on that day, Whosoever getteth up by the Tsinnor,t [Note:\nOunew (batsinnor) in, or by the Tsinnor, which was an\nunderground watercourse, recently discovered by Sir Charles Warren.\nSee his Recovery of Jerusalem, pp. 107, 109, 124.] and smiteth the\nJebusites, and the lame and the blind, who hate David’s soul (Π.Ν.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin); he shall be chief or\ncaptain, because they (the blind and the lame) had said, He shall not\ncome into the house (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] margin),” or citadel.\n\nThe Ellipsis is supplied from 1Ch. 11:6; and thus, with one or two\nsimple emendations, the whole passage is made clear.\n\nIt would seem that the citadel was so strong that the Jebusites put\ntheir blind and lame there, who defended it by merely crying out,\n“David shall not come in hither.”\n\nMat. 6:25.-“Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\n[and if God vouchsafes the greater, how much more that which is\nless].”\n\nMat. 8:9.-“For | am a man under authority, having soldiers under me:\nand | say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and\nhe cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it [how much\nmore art Thou, who art God, able to command, or to speak the word\nonly that my servant may recover).”\n\nMar. 11:32.-“But if we shall say, Of men: [what will happen to us?] for,\nthey feared the people.” Or we may supply, “it will not be wise.”\nLuk. 2:21.-“And when eight days were accomplished for the\ncircumcising of the child [then they circumcised him, and] his name\nwas called JESUS.”\n\nJoh. 3:2.-“Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for\nno man can do these miracles which thou doest, except God be with\nhim: [therefore am | come to thee, that thou mayest teach me the way\nof salvation].”\n\nJoh. 6:62.-“What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where\nhe was before?”\n\nHere the Apodosis is entirely wanting. The Greek reads simply “If\nthen ye should see the Son of man ascending up where he was\nbefore?” The thought is the same as in Joh. 3:12 : “If | have told you\nearthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if | tell you of\nheavenly things?” So that the apodosis may be supplied thus, “will ye\nbelieve then?” or, “ye will not be offended then,” i.e., ye will marvel\nthen not at My doctrine but at your own unbelief of it. Compare 8:28\nand 3:13. (But see further under the figure of Aposiopesis).\nRom. 9:22-24.-Here we have a remarkable anantapodoton. The\nconclusion of the argument is omitted. It begins with “if (verse 22),\nand the apodosis must be supplied at the end of verse 24 from verse\n20, i.e., if God chooses to do this or that “who art thou that repliest\nagainst God?” What have you to say?\n\nOr, indeed, we may treat it as the Ellipsis of a prior member, in\nwhich case verse 22 would commence “[what reply hast thou to\nmake], if God, willing to show his wrath,” etc.\n\nJam. 2:13.-“For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath\nshowed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment [to him that\nhath showed mercy].”\n\n2Pe. 2:4.-The apodosis is wanting here, but it is difficult to supply it\nwithout breaking the argument; which is, “If God spared not the angels\nthat sinned,” neither will he spare the false prophets and teachers,\nmentioned in verse 1.\n\nIt is deferred till verse 12, where we have it:-they “shall utterly\nperish in their own corruption.”\n\n3. When the Comparison is wanting. This is a kind of\nanantapodoton\nRom. 7:3.-In verses 2 and 3 the hypothesis is given in which the\nhusband dies, while in verse 4 the fact to be illustrated is the case in\nwhich the wife dies. Death ending the power of the marriage-law in\neach case.\n\nAt the end of verse 3, therefore, the other hypothesis must be\nsupplied (mentally if not actually):-\n\n“If her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is\nno adulteress, though she be married to another man [and | need not\nsay that if she be dead, she is, of course, free from that law].\nWherefore, my brethren, ye also have died to the law through the\nbody of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who is\nraised from the dead,” {6., God’s people have died in Christ; and, on\nthe other side of death, have risen with Christ, and are united to Him.\nThus being dead with Christ, the Law has no longer any dominion\nover them, and they are free to be united to another, “being dead to\nthat wherein we were held” (verse 6, margin, and, R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] ). Compare the following Scriptures on this\nimportant doctrine:- Rom. 8:2; Rom. 6:1-11; Gal. 2:19; Gal. 5:18; Gal.\n6:14; Col. 2:14; Col. 3:3; 1Pe. 2:24. This figure comes under the head\nof Rhetoric, and is then called Enthymema (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\n1Ti. 1:3-4.-“As | besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when | went\ninto Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no\nother doctrine, Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,\nwhich minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith\n[so ! repeat my charge, that thou remain at Ephesus, etc.]”\n2Ti. 2:20.-“In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of\nsilver, but also of wood and of earth, and, some to honour; and some\nto dishonour: [so in the great house of the church there are not only\nthe elect saints, which are the vessels of honour, but there are the\nimpious and reprobate, who are the vessels of dishonour].” Therefore\nthe admonition follows, in verse 21, to purge ourselves from these;\ni.e., not from the vessels of gold and silver, or wood and earth, but\nfrom persons. Still less does it say we are to purge the persons or the\nassembly! Each one is to “purge himself,” not the others.\n\nWe now come to the second great division.\n\nB. Relative Ellipsis:\n\nWhere the omitted word must be supplied from the words actually\nrelated to it and employed in the context itself.\n|. Where the omitted Word is supplied from a COGNATE Word\noccurring in the Immediate Context\n1. Where the Noun is suggested by the Verb\nLev. 4:2.-‘If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the\ncommandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be\ndone.”\n\nHere the verb “shall sin” supplies the noun “sins,” i.e., “concerning\nsins which ought not to be done.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] evades the difficulty\nby a freer translation. But the correct supply of the Ellipsis enables us\nto retain the literal translation.\n\nNum. 11:14.-“I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is\ntoo heavy for me.”\n\nHere the noun is latent in the verb, and is naturally supplied by it\nthus:-“I am not able to bear the burden of all this people alone,\nbecause it is too heavy for me.” The word “it” does not refer to the\nPeople, but to the burden of them.\n\nIn verse 17 it is translated fully.\n2Ki. 17:14.-“Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their\nnecks, like to the neck of their fathers,” i.e., like to the hardness of the\nnecks of their fathers.\nPsa. 13:3 (4).-“Lighten mine eyes, lest | sleep the death,” {6., the\nsleep of death.\nPsa. 76:11.-“Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God,” i.e., pay your\nvows.\nPsa. 107:41.-“And maketh him families like a flock.”\n\nLit., maketh like a flock the families.\n\nThe two parallel lines are thus completed by supplying the\nEllipsis:-\n\n“Yet setteth he the poor on high from (or, after) affliction,\n\nAnd maketh like a flock the families [of the afflicted].”\nHos. 9:4.-“They shall not offer wine to the Lord,” i.e., wine offerings.\nAs in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.]\nGal. 4:24.-“Which things are an allegory: for these [two women] are\nthe two covenants; the one, indeed, from the mount Sinai, which\nbringeth forth [children] into bondage, which is Hagar.” The apodosis\nor conclusion is suspended till verse 26. “But Jerusalem which is\nabove is the free [woman], who is the mother of us all.” In verse 25, it\nmust be noted that the word “this” is the article τό, which is neuter,\nwhile “Hagar” is feminine. Τό, therefore, must agree with some neuter\nword, which must be supplied, such as ὄνομα (onoma) name:-“For\nthis [name] Hagar is (or, denotes) Mount Sinai in Arabia.” It is a fact\nthat in Arabia the word Hagar (which means a stone) is the name for\nMount Sinai.\n2. Where the Verb is to be supplied from the Noun\n\n1Sa. 13:8.-“And he tarried seven days, according to the time that\nSamuel [had appointed].”\n1Ch. 17:18.-“What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy\nservant?” i.e., the honour put upon thy servant.\nPsa. 94:10.-“He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he\nthat teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?”\n\nCompare verse 9, where we have similar questions.\nHos. 1:2.-“Go, take thee a wife of whoredoms and children of\nwhoredoms.”\n\nThe sense, as we see from verses 3, 6, and 8, must be “and\n[bege?] children,” etc.\nMic. 7:3.-“The prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward.”\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] supplies the Ellipsis by repeating the previous\nverb. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies it with the\nverb “is ready,” i.e., “the judge is ready for a reward.”\n\nBut the verb is latent in the noun (“judge”) and is to be supplied\nfrom it, thus:-\n\n“The prince asketh, and the judge judgeth for a reward.”\n\nThe subject of the former sentence must be supplied from the\nlatter, and then the two lines will read thus:-\n\n“The prince asketh for [a reward],\nAnd the judge [judgeth] for a reward.”\nRom. 12:6-8.-“Having then gifts differing according to the grace given\nto us, whether prophecy, /et us prophesy according to the proportion\nof the faith [given or dealt to us, verse 3].” The verbs must also be\nsupplied in the following, exhortations:-“Or ministry, [/et us be diligent]\nin the ministry: or he that teacheth, [/et him be faithful] in teaching; or\nhe who exhorteth, [/et him employ himself] in exhortation: he Who\ndistributeth, [/et him distribute] with simplicity; he who presideth, [εί\nhim preside] with care; he that showeth mercy, [/et him show if] with\ncheerfulness.”\n\nIn the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,\nsome are supplied and some are not.\n\nRom. 13:7.-“Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute\nis due, etc.”\n\nHere the verb {ο be due is latent in the noun dues.\n1Co. 1:26.-“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise\nmen after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.”\n\nHere the thought or subject is the “calling’-the act of calling, i.e.,\nnot the persons who are called, but the persons who call. The\nfollowing verses go on to explain the manner in which God calls: viz.,\nby choosing the weak and the base to confound the wise and the\nmighty. So in like manner He had chosen weak instruments like Paul,\nApollos and Cephas to call the saints in Corinth, and to produce such\nwondrous results, in order “that no flesh should glory in His presence.”\nThe Ellipsis would in this case be better supplied thus:-“Not many\nwise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble call you.”\n2Co. 5:17.-“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.”\nHere the verb substantive is supplied twice, but the verb created\nmust be supplied from the noun “creature”:-“If any man be in Christ,\n[he is created] a new creature.”\nOr else there is only one Ellipsis, and the sentence reads on, thus:\n“If any man be in Christ a new creation, old things have passed away;\nbehold, all things are become new.”\nEph. 3:16.-‘[Praying] that he would grant you,” from “bowing my\nknees” in verse 14.\nIl. Where the omitted Word is to be supplied from a CONTRARY\nWord\nGen. 33:10.-“And Jacob [refused and] said, etc.”\nThis word is latent in the contrary words which follow.\n\nGen. 33:15.-“And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the\nfolk that are with me. And he [Jacob] said, What needeth it? [Thou\nshalt not leave any],” etc.\n\nGen. 49:4.-“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.”\n\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]\n, ‘Bubbling over as water, thou shalt not have the excellency.”\n\nThe word rendered “unstable” is φβλς (pachaz), to bubble up and\noverflow, to flow down like water. (So Sam. and Syr.). The Ellipsis is\nsupplied from the contrary words, “Flowing down like water [it shall\npass away), thou shalt not have the excellency.”\n\nThis follows on verse 3. “Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might,\nand the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the\nexcellency of power, with rapidity, like water, [all this shall pass away],\nthou shalt not have the excellency!”\n\nAnd so it came to pass. See 1Ch. 5:1.\n\nJdg. 5:6.-Here, because the Ellipsis has not been observed, liberties\nhave been taken in the translation. The Heb. is literally “In the days of\nJael the high-ways ceased” (as in verse 7).\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nboth render, “The high-ways were unoccupied.” The R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] tries to preserve the correctness of\ntranslation by giving in the margin “the caravans ceased.”\n\nBut the Ellipsis when supplied by the contrary words which follow\nmakes all clear:-“In the days of Jael, the highways ceased [fo be safe],\nand the travellers walked through by-ways.”\n\nPsa. 7:11.-“God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the\nwicked every day.”\nPsa. 65:8.-“Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the\nevening to rejoice.”\n\nThis does not mean the outgoings of the evening as well as the\nmorning. The contrary word must be supplied, viz., “[the incomings or\nreturn] of the evening.”\n\nPsa. 66:20.-“Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer,\nnor his mercy from me.” This is not “my prayer from me,” but “my\nprayer [from himself].”\n\nPsa. 84:10.-“For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand\n[elsewhere, or in any other place].”\nPro. 19:1.-“Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [the\nrich, that is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.”\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] has supplied “he that is.” It is necessary merely\nto define the person as rich to complete the contrast which is clearly\nimplied.\n\nPro. 24:17-18.-“Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine\nheart be glad when he stumbleth: lest the Lord see it, and it displease\nhim, and he turn away his wrath from him [to thee].”\n\nWithout the supply of this Ellipsis “to thee,” there is no sense in the\nwords.\n\nPro. 28:16.-“The prince that lacketh understanding [and] also a great\noppressor [shall cut off his days], but he that hateth covetousness,\nshall prolong his days.”\n\nJer. 18:15.-“My people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense\nto vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways [so that\nthey forsake] the ancient paths,” etc.\n\nDan. 3:15.-Here the Ellipsis is so patent that it is supplied. “Now if ye\nbe ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,\nsackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down\nand worship the image which | have made; [well and good].” Compare\nLuk. 13:9.\n\nLuk. 13:9.-“And if it bear fruit, wel/; and if not, then, after that thou\nshalt cut it down.”\n\nHere the omitted verb is suggested by the contrary verb that is\ngiven. Thus: “If it bear fruit [hou shalt leave it to stand, or shalt not cut\nit down], and if not, after that, thou shalt cut it down.”\n\nSee further under the figure of Aposiopesis.\n\nRom. 6:17.-“But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but\nye have obeyed,” etc.\n\nHere the word δέ (de), but, in the latter clause implies and points\nus to the word μέν (men) which is omitted in the former clause. The\ntwo go together in a sentence of this character, and the employment of\nthe one reveals the omission of the other. It should be rendered:-“But\nGod be thanked that [a/though] ye were the servants of sin, yet ye\nhave obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered\nunto you.”\nThis is clearly the sense, for we are not to thank God that we were\nthe servants of sin, but that, though we were, we are so no longer.*\n[Note: For the importance of this word μέν (men), although, compare\n1Ре. 4:6, where both the A.V. and Π.Ν. ignore it, though it is there in\nthe Greek, thus translating the words:-“For this cause was the gospel\npreached to them that are dead also, that they might be judged\naccording to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.”\nSurely, it cannot be that the gospel was preached in order that men\nmight be judged! And it is unaccountable why the A.V. and R.V. should\nboth altogether ignore the important word μέν (men), although, and\nleave it untranslated!\n\nThey have both created an Ellipsis in the English, though there is\nnone in the Greek, which reads iva κριθῶσι μέν (hina krithosi men), “in\norder that, though they might be condemned according to the will of\nmena as to the flesh, yet they might live (ζῶσι δὲ, 2651 de) according\nto the will of God, as to the spirit.” That is to say, the gospel was\npreached to those who had since died, not “that they might be judged”\nthus, but “that THOUGH they might be judged.” (See a pamphlet on\nThe Spirits in Prison, by the same author and publisher.)]\n1Co. 7:19.-“Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,\nbut the keeping of the commandments of God [is everything],” i.e.,\nalone avails.\n2Co. 8:14.-“But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance\nmay be a supply for their want, that [at another time] their abundance\nalso may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality.”\n1Ti. 4:3.-“Forbidding to marry [and commanding] to abstain from\nmeats.” (See under Zeugma.)\nIll. Where the omitted Word is to be supplied from ANALOGOUS,\nor RELATED Words\n\nGen. 50:23.-“The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were\nbrought up upon Joseph’s knees.” Margin, borne. R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] , born.\n\nBut the Ellipsis of relation is:-“[and educated] at Joseph\'s knees.”\nExo. 13:15.-“Therefore | sacrifice to the Lord all [beasts],” etc.\nLev. 21:4.-“But he being a chief man [a priest] among his people, shall\nnot defile himself [for his wife] to profane himself.”\n\nSee verse 14; and Eze. 24:16-17.\nDeu. 15:12.-“And if thy brother, [or thy sister], an Hebrew man, or an\nHebrew woman, be sold unto thee,” etc.\nPsa. 142:4.-Ί looked on my right hand, and beheld [on my left hana.”\nIsa. 30:17.-“One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the\nrebuke of five shall ye [all] flee.”\n\nIsa. 38:12.-“I have cut off as a weaver my life,” i.e., | have cut off my\nlife as a weaver [his thread].\n\nMat. 3:4.-“And a leathern girdle [was bound] about his loins.” In Joh.\n7:39, the verb given is rightly supplied in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “For\nthe Holy Spirit was not yet given.”\n\nRom. 14:21.-“It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any\nthing whereby thy brother stumbleth,” ᾖθ., nor to do any thing\nwhereby, etc.\n\nThe point is not merely abstaining from the use of anything that\nother people abuse, but from that which is a cause of stumbling to the\nweak conscience of the brother in Christ, who thought it wrong to eat\nor drink that which has been offered to an idol.\n\nRom. 16:16.-“Salute one another with an holy kiss.”\nHere, the fact that ἀλλήλους (alleelous) is masculine, and the\nundoubted and overwhelming testimony of the Primitive Church,\nnecessitate an Ellipsis; which must certainly be understood, if not\nactually supplied. It was, and is, contrary to all Eastern usage for\nwomen (who were always covered, 1Co. 11:5) and men to kiss each\nother indiscriminately. The Ellipsis understood is:-“Salute one another\n[men and women respectively] with a holy kiss.”\n\nThe Apostolical Constitutions (Cent. Ill.) say:-“Let the men salute\none another (masc.), and the women one another (fem.), with a kiss.”\n\nIn this sense are to be understood also 1Co. 16:20; 2Co. 13:12;\n1Th. 5:26; 1Pe. 5:14.* [Note: For an exhaustive treatment of the whole\nsubject, see a work, entitled Salute One Another, by the Rev. Jas.\nNeil, M.A. Lond.: Simpkin and Marshall.]\n\nIV. Where the omitted Word is contained in another Word, the\nOne combining the two Significations\nThis has been called Metalepsis: but this is hardly correct; for\nMetalepsis (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ) is a compound Metonomy, and а\nMetonomy has to do only with nouns. It has also been called\nSyntheton, or Synthesis (Latin, Compositio), which signifies the\nplacing of two things together. (See under the Figure of Metonymy). It\nhas also a Latin name: “Concisa Locutio,” i.e., a concise form of\nspeech, or abbreviated expression.\n\nIt is also called Constructio Praegnans, when the verb thus derives\nan additional force.\n\nGen. 12:15.-“And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.”\n\nHere the figure is translated, for МЧЗ (laqach) signifies to catch,\nor capture. (Gen. 14:12. Num. 21:25. Deu. 3:14; Deu. 29:7. 1Sa.\n19:14; 1Sa. 19:20. Isa. 52:5. Jer. 48:46). And here the two senses are\ncombined (take, in the sense of catch, and take, in the sense of /ead),\nto take possession of, and lead into, i.e., “The woman was taken [and\nbrought] into Pharaoh’s house.”\n\nSee for a similar use, seized, or caught and led, or taken and\n\nbrought, etc., Gen. 15:9-10. Exo. 18:2; Exo. 25:2; Exo. 27:20. Num.\n19:2. Est. 2:16.\nGen. 43:33.-“And the men marvelled one at another.” They did not\nmarvel one at another, but, marvelling at what Joseph did, they looked\none at another. The two senses are contained in the one verb,\nthus:-“And the men marvelled [and looked] one at another.”\nIn verse 34, the two senses are translated both in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “and he took and sent\nmesses unto them from before him.” For this use of the verb puja\n(nahsah) to take, see also Exo. 18:12; Exo. 25:2; Exo. 28:20, etc.\n\nExo. 23:18; Exo. 34:25.-Here the Hebrew *63 (zavach) to sacrifice,\nor slay, is not literally translated, but the two senses, s/ay and pour out\n(the blood) are combined in the one word “offer.”\n\nThe Heb. TM (al) is also in consequence translated with, instead\n\nof upon. The result is that there is no sense in the translation. The\nfilling up of the Ellipsis preserves the literal signification of the other\nwords as well as the sense of the verse, thus:-“Thou shalt not slay\n[and pour out] the blood of my sacrifice upon leavened bread.”\nLev. 17:3.-“What man soever there be of the house of Israel that\nkilleth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the\ncamp, and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation ... blood shall be imputed unto that man ... that man\nshall be cut off from among his people.”\nThis appears to be quite at variance with Deu. 12:15; Deu. 12:21,\nwhich expressly declares, “Thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy\ngates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.”\n\nThe difficulty is at once removed by supplying the second sense\nwhich is included in the same word, “that killeth [in sacrifice].”\n\nNum. 25:1.-Here, through not seeing the Ellipsis, AM (el) which\nmeans fo, is translated with.\n\n“And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of\nMoab,” i.e., they “began to commit whoredom [and to join themselves]\nto the daughters of Moab.”\n\nJos. 8:29.-“Joshua commanded that they should raise thereon a great\nheap of stones that remaineth unto this day.”\n\nHere, as well as in 10:27, the Ellipsis is supplied.\n2Ch. 32:1.-“And thought to win them for himself.”-\n\nHere MOUTH amie (I\'vikam eylayo) means (as given in the\nmargin) to break them up, but this being “for himself,” conveyed no\nsense; so the translation of the verb, which means “break up,” was\nmodified to “win,” in order to agree with the preposition “for.” But the\ncorrect supply of the Ellipsis makes the meaning clear, and enables us\nto retain the literal sense of the verb:-He “encamped against the\nfenced cities, and thought to break them up [and annex them] to\nhimself,” or “thought to rend them [from the kingdom of Judah, and\nannex them] to himself.”\nEzr. 2:62.-Here the figure is translated. The Heb., as given in the\nmargin, reads literally, “Therefore they were polluted from the\npriesthood.” This is translated, “Therefore were they, as polluted, put\nfrom the priesthood.” But a more correct translation of the figure would\nbe: “Therefore they were polluted [and put] from the priesthood.”\nPsa. 21:12.-We have already noted the Ellipsis of the accusative in\nthis verse, “thine arrows.” Now we have the Ellipsis, in the same\nverse, of the second signification of the verb:-“When thou shalt make\nready thine arrows upon thy bowstrings [and shoot them] against their\nface.”\nPsa. 22:21.-“Thou hast heard me [and delivered me], from the horns\nof the unicorns.”\n\nSo Psa. 118:5, where the Ellipsis is correctly supplied. See also\nHeb. verse 7, below.\nPsa. 55:18.-“He hath delivered my soul in peace.” R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] : “He hath redeemed my soul in peace.”\n\nThe sense is obtained by supplying the Ellipsis-‘He hath\nredeemed my soul [and set if] in peace.”\n\nPsa. 63:8.-“My soul followeth hard after thee.”\n\nHere to get the sense, the Heb. r6ug (dahvgah), which means to\ncleave, to stick (see Gen. 2:24. Deu. 28:60. Psa. 119:31. Lam. 4:4), is\ntranslated followeth hard, in order to combine it with ЭЗШИК,\n(achareyach) after thee. “My soul followeth hard after thee.” The\nsupply of the Ellipsis makes the sense clear and retains the literal\nmeaning of the words, thus:-“My soul cleaveth to [and followeth] after\nthee.”\n\nPsa. 66:14.-The Heb. is:-“Which my lips have opened.” See margin.\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] translates freely, “Which my lips have uttered.” But the\nsense is:-“Which (vows) my lips have opened [and vowed].”\n\nPsa. 68:18.-“Thou hast received gifts for men.” The Heb. is:-“Thou\nhast received gifts among men,” ᾖ6., “Thou hast received [and given]\ngifts among men”; compare Eph. 4:8.\n\nPsa. 73:27.-“Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from\nthee.”\n\nTo make sense we must read:-“Thou hast destroyed all them that\ngo a whoring, [departing] from thee,” i.e., “Thou hast destroyed all\nthem that practise idolatry, departing from thee.”\nPsa. 89:39.-Here the Ellipsis is supplied. “Thou hast profaned his\ncrown [by Casting if] to the ground.”\n\nPsa. 104:22.-“The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and\nlay them down in their dens.” The Heb. is:-“And unto their dens\n(eamOoTepbh) they lie down,” i.e., “The sun ariseth, they gather\nthemselves together, [depart, and] lay themselves down in their dens.”\nPro. 25:22.-The Heb. reads:-“For coals of fire thou shalt receive upon\nhis head,” i.e., “for coals of fire thou Shalt receive [and place] upon his\nhead.”\n\nThe verb ЗЪД (chathah) means to take hold of, to seize, spoken\nonce of a person, Isa. 52:5 (7), and elsewhere always of taking up fire\nor burning coals. See Isa. 30:14. Pro. 6:27. 1.е., the coals of fire which\nthine enemy casts at thee, thou shalt take them and put them upon his\nhead: he will thus get what he intended for thee.\n\nThe “burning coals” are put by Metonymy (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] )\nfor cruel words and hard speeches (see Pro. 16:27; Pro. 26:23).\n\nPsa. 140:9-10. But if thou doest good to him who uses cruel words\nof you, that will burn him as coals of fire.\nMat. 4:5.-“Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy city.”\nΠαραλαμβάνω (paralamban6é) means to take and bring with one’s self,\nto join one’s self. There is no equivalent for “up.” The double sense of\nthe verse must be supplied in the Ellipsis:-“Then the Devil taketh him\nwith himself [and leadeth] him,” etc. So verse 8 and 27:27. The sense\nis sometimes completed by a second verb, Mat. 2:13; Mat. 2:20. Joh.\n19:16. Act. 23:18.\nMat. 5:23.-“Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there\nrememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee”; {6., “if thou\nbring thy gift [even thy sacrifice] to the altar.” An offering was the only\ngift that could be brought to an altar. In Lev. 2:1-2, the Septuagint\ntranslates, “If a soul bring a gift, a sacrifice, to the Lord, his gift shall\nbe,” etc., and thus supplies the explanatory words. To apply these\nwords to the placing money on the Lord’s Table is a perverse use of\nlanguage.\nLuk. 4:1-2.-“And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from\nJordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days\ntempted of the devil.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] connects the forty days with the temptation: but\nwe learn from Mat. 4:3 that it was not till after the forty days that the\ntempter came to Him, when He was hungry. The words are elliptical,\nand are a concisa locutio, i.e., an abbreviated expression, in order that\nour thought may dwell on the fact of the /eading, rather than on the\nfact of His being there.\n\nThe Greek is:-“He was being led by the Spirit into the wilderness,\n[and was in the wilderness] forty days.”\nLuk. 4:38.-“And he arose out of the synagogue,” i.e., “And rising up\n[he departed] out* [Note: The ancient reading was ἀγὸ, from,\nsupported by the Critical Texts of Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, and\nWestcott and Hort. It was altered later by some copyist who did not\nsee the force of the figure, so as to make it agree better with the single\nverb employed.] of the synagogue, and entered into the house of\nSimon.” By this figure our attention is directed to the fact which is\nimportant, viz., His rising up, and thus preventing any comment on the\nmiracle; rather than to the mere act of going out of the synagogue.\nLuk. 18:14.- tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather\nthan the other.”\nThe Greek reads, “This man went down to his house justified than\nthe other,” but the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies the disjunction\ncontained in the comparative ἤ (ee), when following a positive\nassertion. The thought lies in the Heb. use of the word ОП (min), Psa.\n118:8-9 : “It is better to trust in the Lord than [i.e., and пой to put\nconfidence in man. /t is better to trust in the Lord than [i.e., and пой to\nput confidence in princes.” So Jon. 4:3. “Now, O Lord, take, | beseech\nthee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than [i.e., and пой to\nlive.”\n\nSo in the N.T., Heb. 11:25 : “Choosing rather to suffer affliction with\nthe People of God, than [i.e., and пой to enjoy the pleasures of sin for\n8 season.”\n\nSo here the doctrine is that the Publican was justified and not the\nPharisee. Not that the Pharisee was justified a little, and the Publican\nwas justified a little more! The parable is wholly concerning\njustification (verse 9), and not a parable about the nature of prayer.\nThe manner of the prayer is merely the vehicle for the illustration of\nthe truth.* [Note: Ignorance of the doctrine of justification, it may have\nbeen, or oversight as to the point of the parable, that gave rise to the\ndifficulties presented by the Text, which was altered and glossed in\nvarious ways in order to make sense. The Textus Receptus has\nἢ ἐκεῖνος, the mss. APQ, &c. have й 74? €?717??, with T.Tr. marg.\n(i.e., “This man went down to his house justified ... or was it then the\nother, &c.”). The mss. BLa have 22ῤ €?712??, with L.Tr.WH.AIf. (i.e.,\npassing over the other).]\n\nLuk. 19:44.-“And shall lay thee even with the ground.” ἐδαφίζειν\n(edaphizein) signifies both {ο level to the ground, and to dash to the\nground. In this last sense it occurs in Psa. 137:9. Hos. 10:14; LXX.\n[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\nLuk. 20:9.-“A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to\nhusbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time,” i.e., “he\nwent into a far country, [and remained there] a long time”; or, we may\nsupply, “and was absent for a long time.”\n\nLuk. 21:38.-“And all the people came early in the morning to him in\nthe temple, for to hear him.”\n\nBut ὀρθρίζω (orthriz6) does not mean to come early, but {ο rise up\nearly, and the sense is:-“And all the people rising early in the morning,\n[came] to him in the temple.”\n\nJoh. 1:23.-“He said, | am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,”\netc.: i.e., “Il [am he of whom it is written] the voice of one crying in the\nwilderness.”\nJoh. 6:21.-“Then they willingly received him into the ship.” Here the\nfigure is hidden by a free translation. The Greek is:-“They were willing,\nthen, to receive him into the ship, [and they did receive him].”\nAct. 7:9.-“And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into\nEgypt,” i.e., “And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph [and\nsent him away] into Egypt.\n\nἈποδίδωμι (apodidémi) does not mean merely fo sell, but to put\naway by giving over, whether for money or for any other return.\nAct. 20:30.-“Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking\nperverse things, to draw away disciples after them,” i.e., “speaking\nperverse things [and seeking] to draw away.”\nAct. 23:24.-“And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and\nbring him safe unto Felix the governor.” The Greek is, ΙΗ.,:- διασώζω\n(dias6z6) to save through,” i.e., “and keep him in safety [and bring\nhim] unto Felix.”\nHere, by the omission of the verb {ο bring, which is required by the\npreposition, our attention is called to the fact which is of greater\nimportance, viz., the preservation of Paul from his enemies.\n\nGal. 5:4.-“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you\nare justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.”\n\nThe Greek ἶς:-κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ (kateergeetheete apo\ntou Christou); and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\ntranslates it:-“Ye are severed from Christ,” and puts in the margin,\nGreek “brought to nought.” But we may take the Greek literally, if we\nput the margin in the Text and supply the Ellipsis correctly:-\n\n“Ye are made void [and cut off] from Christ.”\n\nEph. 4:8.-“When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive\nand, [receiving] gifts, gave them to men.” See Psa. 68:18 above.\n\n2Ti. 1:10.-“And hath brought life and immortality to light through the\ngospel.”\n\nHere, following the order of the Greek, we may read:-“And brought\nto light, [and procured for us] life and immortality through the gospel.”\nBy the Figure of Hendiadys (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), that which is\nprocured is immortal life, showing us that the emphasis is on the word\n“immortal.”\n2Ti. 2:26.-“And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of\nthe devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.”\n\nHere both the figure and the sense are lost by defective\ntranslation. The margin tells us that the words “recover themselves”\nare used to render the Greek “awake,” i.e., “lest they may awake [and\nbe delivered] out of the snare of the devil.”\n\nThe structure of this Scripture makes the whole passage clear:-\n\nSubversion.\nΑ 14. The aim of the enemy “Subversion” (καταστροφῇ).\nВ — 15. The workman (ἐργάτης).\n©С 16. Exhortation. “Shun.”\nD 17, 18-. Illustration. “Canker.”\nЕ  -18. Effect on others. “Overthrown.”\nE 19.

The aim of the enemy. “Opposition” (ἀντιδιατιθέμενοι).\nThen by expanding this last member A, we see the meaning of\nverses -25, 26:-\nA. The aim of the enemy.\nА а -25-. “Lest God should give them repentance”\nb — -25. “Unto (εἰς) the knowledge of the truth,”\nа — 26-. “And lest, being taken alive by him, [by God, as in “а”]\nthey may awake [and be delivered] from the devil\'s snare”\nЬ -26. “Unto (εἰς) his [6οα”5] will (i.e., to do the will of\nGod).”\nHere in “a” and “a” we have the action of God in delivering, while in\n“b” and “b” we have the object for which the captive is delivered.\n2Ti. 4:18.-“And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will\npreserve me unto his heavenly kingdom:” i.e., “preserve me, [and\nbring mej.” Thus fixing our thought rather on the wondrous\npreservation than on the act of bringing.\nHeb. 5:3.-“And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also\nfor himself, to offer [sacrifices] for sins.”\nHeb. 5:7.-“And was heard [and delivered] from his fear.” ἁπὸ τῆς\nεὐλαβείας (apo tees eulabeias). (Only here and Heb. 12:28). See Psa.\n22:21, above.\nHeb. 9:16-17.-“For where a testament is, there must also of necessity\nbe the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are\ndead: otherwise it is of no strength at all whilst the testator liveth.”\n\nIt is clear that it is a “covenant” to which these words refer, and not\na testamentary document. The reference to the “first” covenant at\nSinai mentioned in the verses which immediately follow, decides this\nfor us. See Exo. 24:5-8.\nAnd the mention also of the sprinkling of the blood shows that\nsacrifices are referred to.\n\nThe word translated “testator” is the participle:-dia8éyevoc\n(diathemenos), and means appointed.* [Note: Participle of 2222322222\n(diatitheemi), to appoint (566 Luk. 22:29). “And | appoint unto you a\nkingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.” Act. 3:25 : “The\ncovenant which God made with our fathers.” Heb. 8:10 : “This is the\ncovenant which | will make with the house of Israel after those days,\nsaith the Lord.” So also Heb. 10:16. These are the only places where\nthe verb occurs, except this passage.] Its use shows that the sacrifice\nby which the covenant was made is really contained in the word.\n\nAnd the word διαθήκη (diatheekee) everywhere means covenant.\n\nSo that, in accordance with these Scriptures and facts, we may\ntranslate verses 16-18, as follows:-\n\n“For where a covenant is, there must also of necessity be the\ndeath of him (or that) which makes [the sacrifice]. For a covenant is of\nforce over* [Note: ἐπί means over, as marking the ground or\nfoundation of the action. See Mat. 24:47. Luk. 12:44; Luk. 15:7 (7), 10;\n19:41; 23:38. Act. 8:2. 1Th. 3:7. Rev. 11:10; Rev. 18:11. It is\ntranslated, “upon” and “on,” etc., many times; but “after” only here and\nLuk. 1:59.] dead [victims or sacrifices]; otherwise it is never held to be\nof force while he who is the appointed [sacrifice] is alive. Where-upon\nneither the first [covenant] was dedicated without blood,” etc.\nHeb. 10:23.-“Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,”\ni.e., “Having our hearts sprinkled [and so being delivered] from an evil\nconscience.”\n1Pe. 3:20.-“Were saved by water,” i.e, “Were preserved [and\ndelivered] by water.”\nRev. 13:3.-“And all the world wondered after the beast.” ὁπίσω (opis6)\nis an adverb of place or time, and means back, behind, after (see Rev.\n1:10; Rev. 12:15). It cannot, therefore, be taken in connection simply\nWith wondered. But the following is the sense:-\n\n“And all the world wondered [and followed] after the beast.”\nRev. 20:2.-“And bound him a thousand years,” i.e., “And bound him\n[and kept him bound] a thousand years.”\n\nC. The Ellipsis of Repetition:\n\nWhere the omitted word or words is, or are to be supplied out of the\npreceding or following clause, in order to complete the sense.\nThis Ellipsis is either simple or complex.\n\nSimple, when anything is to be repeated separately, either out of\nwhat precedes or follows.\n\nComplex, when two things are to be repeated; one out of a\npreceding clause into the following clause; and at the same time\nanother out of the following into the preceding clause.\n\n|. Simple\n1. Where the Omission is to be supplied by REPEATING a word or\nwords out of the Preceding Clause\n\n(a) Nouns and Pronouns\nExo. 12:4.-“Let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it,”\nie., the lamb from verse 3.\n1Ki. 1:6.-“And [Haggith] bare him after Absalom.”\n2Ki. 3:25.-“Only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof.”\n\nThe Heb. reads (see margin):-“Until he left the stones thereof in\nKir-haraseth.”\nThe Ellipsis is to be supplied from verse 24. “Until in Kir-haraseth\n[only] they left the stones thereof [fo the Moabites].”\nPsa. 12:6, (7).-“The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried\nin a furnace of earth, purified seven times.”\nHere there is an important Ellipsis. № has been a great difficulty\nwith many to think that the Lord’s words should require purifying,\nespecially after the declaration in the first part of the verse, that they\nare “pure.” What increases the difficulty is the fact that the word for\nearth is ALUIX (eretz), the earth: i.e., the dry land or the world as\ncreated, as in Gen. 1:1 : “In the beginning God created the heaven\nand the earth” (ALLIX, επείζ). It is generally taken as though it were\nused of a crucible made of earth or clay; but in this case it would be\nаГОД (adamah), ground, soil, clay; and not eretz, the whole earth;\nMoreover, the Lamed prefixed (М) means fo or pertaining to. It is the\nsign of the dative case and not of the genitive. The Revisers note this\nand render it:-“As silver tried in a furnace on the earth,” as though it\nwas important for us to note that it is not in or under the earth! But this\ndoes not touch the real difficulty. This is removed only by correctly\nsupplying the Ellipsis, and repeating the noun “words” from the\nbeginning of the verse.\n\nThen, all is clear, and we not only may, but must then take the rest\nof the words in their literal sense. Thus:-“The words of the Lord are\npure words, as silver tried in a furnace; [words] of the earth: (or\npertaining to the earth), purified seven times.”\nThat is to say the words in which Jehovah has been pleased to\nmake His revelation, are not the words of angels (1Co. 13:1), nor the\n“unspeakable words of Paradise” (2Co. 12:4), but they were words\npertaining to man in this world-human words-but refined and purified\nas Silver. Hence, in taking human language, there are many words\nwhich the Holy Spirit has not chosen, and which cannot be found in\nthe Scriptures:\n\nSome are exalted to an altogether higher meaning as\n\nἀρετή (aretee), as man had used it, meant merrily excellence\nof any kind, manhood, nobility, valour, prowess. But, in the\nScriptures, it is used in the higher sense of glory (Hab. 3:3),\npraise (58. 42:8; Isa. 42:12; Isa. 43:21; Isa. 53:7). And 5ο\nin the New Testament, Php. 4:8; 1Pe. 2:9; 2Pe. 1:3; 2Pe.\n1:5.\n\nἦθος (eethos) was only the haunt of an animal, but it became\ncustom, morals, character.\n\nSome are used in a totally different sense from that in which they\nhad ever been used before.\n\nχορηγέω (спогеедс) was simply to furnish or lead a chorus,\nhut\nit was changed {ο furnish or supply. 1Pe. 4:11 : “My God\n\nshall supply all your need.”\nεὐαγγέλιον (euangelion) was merely the dispatch containing\n\nthe news, but it was used in the new sense of the gospel of\n\nGod.\nἐκκλησία (ekkleesia) was used by the Greeks of any assembly,\n\nbut especially of citizens, or as we should say of a\n\nselection from them, “burgesses.” The word means an\n\nassembly of those called out, an elect assembly.\n\nHence it is used in the Septuagint of Israel as called out\nfrom and as being an election from the nations.\n\nThen, it was used of the congregation worshipping at the\nTabernacle as distinguished from the rest of the people.\n\nIn this sense it is used in the Old Testament, the Gospels,\nand partly in the Acts. But in the Pauline Epistles the Holy\nSpirit uses the word and exalts it to a far higher meaning; viz.,\nof the special election from both Jews and Gentiles, forming\nthem as members of Christ’s Mystical Body into a new ecclesia\nor assembly. This is a sense in which it had never before been\nused.* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nσωτηρία (séteeria) was merely preservation or deliverance\nfrom danger, but in the Scriptures it is “the salvation of\nGod.”\nπαράκλητος (paracleetos) was merely the legal assistant or\nhelper. In the New Testament there is one Paracleetos\nwithin us that we may not Sin (Joh. 14:16; Joh. 14:26; Joh.\n15:26; Joh. 16:7); and another Paracleetos with the Father\nif we do sin (1Jn. 2:1).\n\nσκάνδαλον (skandalon) was used only of the trigger of a trap\nto catch animals; but in the New Testament it is used in a\nnew and moral sense, of that which causes any one to be\ncaught or made to trip.\n\nOther words were coined by the Holy Spirit Himself, and cannot be\nfound in any human writings.\n\nσκανδαλίζω (skandaliz6) is a new word altogether. It is never\nused in Classical Greek, it means {ο cause to stumble or\nfall, to give cause of offence.\n\nἐπιούσιος (epiousios) is a word used only by our Lord (Mat.\n6:11 and Luk. 11:3) in the Lord’s Prayer, where it is\nrendered “daily.”\nHence the difficulty in interpreting it, as there is no usage to\n\nhelp us. It is a question, therefore, of etymology. It is the\npreposition ἐπὶ (epi), upon, prefixed to the participle of a verb.\nBut what verb? It cannot be the participle of the verb εἰμί\n(eimi), to be, for its participle is οὖσα (ousa), and the\ncombination of otica with ἐπ] would be ἐποῦσα. It must be εἶμι\n(eimi), to go or come, for its participle is ἰοῦσα (iousa), and the\ncombination of ἰοῦσα with ἐτή will be ἐπιοῦσα, as used by our\nLord. The word means, therefore, coming upon or going upon,\nand would refer either to bread for our going or journeying\nupon, or to the bread coming or descending upon us from\nheaven, as the manna descended and came down upon Israel\n(Joh. 6:32-33).\n\nHence it combines the two ideas of heavenly and daily,\ninasmuch as the manna not only came down from heaven, but\ndid so every day, and on the strength of this they journeyed. It\nis a word therefore of great fulness of meaning.\n\nThat the Ellipsis exists in Psa. 12:6 (which verse we are\nconsidering), and may be thus supplied, is shown further from the\nstructure of the Psalm:-\n\nΑ 1. Decrease of good.\n\nВ а _ 2.Man’s words (Falsehood).\nЬ — 3, 4. Their end: “cut off.”\n6 5-. Oppression.\nр -5-. Sighing.\nр -5-. | will arise (for sighing).\n©С -5.1 will deliver (from oppression).\nВ а 6. Jehovah\'s words (Truth).\nЬ — 7. Their end: (preserved).\n\nΑ 8. Increase of bad.\n\nHere in B, Jehovah’s words are placed in contrast with man’s\nwords in B: in a and a, their character respectively: and in b and b\ntheir end.\n\nFinally, we may expand a (verse 6) as follows:-\n\na ο The words of Jehovah are pure words.\n\n@ — As silver tried in a furnace:\nс [Words] pertaining to the earth.\nа Purified seven times.\n\nHere in c and c we have “words,” and in d and d we have the\npurifying of the silver.\n\nPsa. 68:18.-“Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity\ncaptive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also,\nthat the Lord God might dwell among them,” i.e., among or with those\nrebels who have been taken captives.\n\nEcc. 12:11.-‘The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails\nfastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one\nshepherd.”\n\nHere, instead of repeating “the words” from the first clause, the\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] inserts the word “by,” thus producing incoherence in the\npassage. The structure shows us at once how the Ellipsis should be\nfilled up.\n\nа — The words of the wise\n\nbare as goads,\nbandas tent-pegs well fixed,\n\nа are [the words] of the masters of the assemblies.\n\nHere, in a and a, we have “words,” and in b and b, what they are\ncompared to.\nIn “a” we have the words of those which act like goads, inciting to\naction, or probing the conscience; while in a we have the words of\nthose who are the leaders of assemblies, propounding firmly\nestablished principles and settled teaching. “Both of these (not\n“which”) are given by the same shepherd.”\n\nThat is, as a chief shepherd gives to one servant a goad for his\nuse, and to another a stake, or “tent-peg,” to fix firmly in the ground,\nso the God of all wisdom, by the Chief Shepherd in glory, gives to His\nservants “words,” different in their tendency and action, but conducing\nto the same end, showing the one source from which the various gifts\nare received. He gives to some of His under-shepherds “words” which\nact as goads; while He gives to others “words” which “stablish,\nstrengthen and settle.”\n\nIsa. 40:13.-“Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his\ncounsellor hath taught him?”\n\nHere the Ellipsis is arbitrarily supplied by the word “being,” which\nnecessitates a departure from the Heb., which is given in the margin,\n“made him understand.”\n\nThe Ellipsis is correctly supplied thus:-“Who hath directed the\nSpirit of the Lord; or [who] as His counsellor hath made him to\nunderstand?”\n\nAmo. 3:12.-“As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two\nlegs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out\nthat dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a\ncouch,” i.e., “and [in the corner ой a couch.”\n\nMal. 2:14.-“Yet ye say, Wherefore?” i.e., from verse 13, wherefore\n[does He not regard our offering, etc.]?\n\nAct. 7:15-16.-“So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our\nfathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre\nthat Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the\nfather of Sychem.”\n\nHere the article τοῦ (tou), of the, rendered “the father,” should be\név (en), in, according to Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and\nthe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nThere must have been three purchases altogether, of which two\nare recorded in Genesis, and one in Act. 7:1-60\n\n(1) According to Act. 7:16, Abraham bought a sepulchre from the\nsons of Hamor.\n\nThere is no record of this purchase in Genesis. But Stephen, “full\nof the Holy Ghost,” supplies the information. It was purchased of\nHamor, the son of Shechem, for “a sum of money.” Shechem was the\nplace where God first appeared to Abraham in Canaan (Gen. 12:6),\nand where he first built an altar (verse 7). Here it was that (according\nto Act. 7:16) he bought “a sepulchre.”\n\nThe original Shechem must have been an important person to\nhave given his name to a place; and it was of his son that Abraham\nbought it.\n\n(2) According to Gen. 23:1-20, Abraham purchased a field with\ntrees in it and round it; and a cave called Machpelah at the end of it. It\nwas situated at Hebron (Mamre), and was purchased of Ephron the\nHittite, the son of Zohar, for 400 shekels of silver. Here Abraham\nburied Sarah, and here he himself was buried. Here also were buried\nIsaac, Rebekah and Jacob (Gen. 49:29-32; Gen. 50:13).\n\n(3) Jacob’s purchase in Gen. 33:19, was years afterward, of\nanother Hamor, another descendant of the former Shechem. What\nJacob bought was “a parcel of a field,” of Hamor, a Hivite, perhaps the\nvery field which surrounded the “sepulchre” which Abraham had\nbefore bought of an ancestor of this Hamor. Jacob gave 100 pieces of\nmoney (or lambs, margin) for it. Here Joseph was buried (Jos. 24:32),\nand here Jacob’s sons were “carried over,” or transferred, as Joseph\nwas.\nNow Act. 7:15 speaks of two parties, as well as of three\npurchases:-“he” ({6., Jacob), and “our fathers.” In verse 16 the verb is\nplural and must necessarily refer not to “he” (Jacob), who was buried\nin Machpelah, but to “our fathers.” They were carried over and laid in\nthe sepulchre that Abraham bought, not of “Ephron the Hittite” (Gen.\n23:1-20), but of Hamor the Hivite.\n\nIn the abbreviated rehearsal of facts well known to all to whom\nStephen spoke, and who would gladly have caught at the least slip, if\nhe had made one, Stephen condensed the history, and presented it\nelliptically thus:-\n\n“So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers, and\n[our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre:-\n[he, i.e., Jacob] in that which (ᾧ, Πο\" [Note: Griesbach, Lachmann,\nTischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Wordsworth, Westcott and Hort, read ᾧ\n(6) in that which, instead of 6 (Πο) which.] ) Abraham bought for a\nsum of money, [and they in that which was bought] from the sons of\nHamor in Sychem.”\n\nIt is probable that the rest of the “fathers” who died in Egypt were\ngathered to both of these burial places, for Josephus says (Ant. lib.\n2.4) that they were buried at Hebron; while Jerome (Ep. ad\nPammach.) declares that in his day their sepulchres were at\nShechem, and were visited by strangers.\n\nRom. 6:5.-“For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his\ndeath, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.” Here it is,\n“We shall be raised [in the likeness] of his resurrection also.” (See\nabove, pages 18, 19).\n\nRom. 12:11.-“Not slothful in business.” Lit., “not slothful in earnest\ncare [i.e., earnest care for others (from verse 10).”\n\n1Со. 2:11.-“For what man knoweth the things of a man?” /е., the\n[deep] things (or depths), from verse 10-the secret thoughts and\npurposes of the spirit of man. “So the [deep] things (or depths) of God,\nknoweth no man but the Spirit of God.”\n\n1Со. 2:13.-“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s\nwisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing\nspiritual things with spiritual:”\nHere we have, first, to repeat in the second clause the expression\n“in the words” from the first clause:-“Not in the words which man’s\nwisdom teacheth, but [in the words] which the Holy Ghost teacheth.”\nThis prepares the way for the supply of the important Ellipses of the\nlast sentence. The two adjectives “spiritual” (one neuter accusative\nplural and the other masculine dative plural) must have nouns which\nthey respectively qualify, and the question is, What are these nouns to\nbe? The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] suggests “things” (which ought to have been in\nitalics). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] suggests, in the\nmargin, two different nouns:-‘interpreting spiritual things to spiritual\nmen.” Much depends on the meaning of the verb συγκρίνω (sunkrind)\nwhich occurs only here, and in 2Co. 10:12, in the New Testament. Its\netymological meaning is clear, being a compound of κρίνω (krind), to\nseparate or sift (hence, to judge) and σύν (sun), together with, so that\nit means literally to separate or take to pieces and then to put\ntogether. When we do this with things, we compare them by judging\nthem, or we judge them by comparing them; hence, συγκρίνω\n(sunkrino), is translated “compare” in 2Co. 10:12, and is used of the\nfoolishness of those who “measuring themselves by themselves, and\ncomparing themselves among themselves, are not wise” (margin,\n“understand # not”). Here the force of the idea of judging is clearly\nseen. So also the verb is used in Wis. 7:29, where wisdom “being\ncompared with the light is found before it.” In Wis. 15:18 :-“They\nworshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being\ncompared together, some are worse than others.”\n\nIn 1Ma. 10:71, the idea of judging is very clear, being translated\n“try.” Apollonius says to Jonathan, “Now therefore, if thou trustest in\nthine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let\nus try the matter together;” i.e., let us judge or determine the matter\ntogether.\n\nIn Gen. 40:8; Gen. 40:16; Gen. 40:22; Gen. 41:12; Gen. 41:15, itis\nused for Cpbu (pahthar), to open, hence, to interpret; and in Dan.\n5:13; Dan. 5:17 for the Chald. Φμμίι (p’shar), to explain, interpret;\nalso in Num. 15:34 for Φμιῃῃ (pahrash), to separate or divide, hence\n(in Pual), to declare distinctly.* [Note: See also Neh. 8:8, “distinctly,”\nand Ezr. 4:18, “plainly.”]\n\n“And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what\nshould be done to him” (i.e., to the man who had gathered\nsticks on the Sabbath).\n\nHence, for these are all the occurrences of the verb συγκρίνω\n(sunkrin6é), the general meaning of the verb is to communicate\ndistinctly so as to expound or interpret or make anything clear and\nplain: i.e., to separate or take anything to pieces and put it together\nagain so as to make its nature or construction known. This meaning-to\nmake known or declare-thus seems to combine all the various ideas\nincluded in the verb. For we cannot become known to ourselves by\nmeasuring ourselves with others (2Co. 10:12). Hence the dreams\nwere interpreted or made known (Gen. 40:8, etc.), and it was not\nmade known what was to be done to the Sabbath-breaker (Num.\n15:34). This meaning, too, agrees with 1Co. 2:13, where it is used in\nconnection with persons.\n\nSome propose to supply the Ellipsis with the word “words” from the\nformer part of the verse. But though it is true, in fact, that the apostle\ndeclared spiritual things with spiritual words, it is not in harmony with\nwhat is said in the larger context here.\nIn verse 1 he explains that when he came to them he could not\ndeclare unto them “the mystery of God.” For so the words must be\nread, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , and all the\ncritical Greek Texts.* [Note: 2222232223 (musteerion), mystery, and not\n3:68: (marturion), testimony.]\n\nHe was obliged to confine his teaching to truths connected with\n“Christ crucified,” and could not go on to those glorious truths\nconnected with Christ risen (as in Eph. and Col.) Howbeit (he adds)\nwe do “teach wisdom among them that are initiated” (verse 5), even\nthe mystery (verse 6) which had been hidden, but which God had now\nrevealed (verse 10) to him and to the Church through him: viz., the\nhitherto profound and absolute secret of the Body of Christ, consisting\nof Christ the glorious Head in heaven, and His people the members of\nthat body here upon earth; Jews and Gentiles forming “one new man”\nin Christ.\n\nBut these Corinthians (when he went to them) were all taken up\nwith their own “Bodies.” One said, “I am of Paul”; and another, “I am of\nApollos.” How, then, could they be prepared to hear, and be initiated\ninto, the wondrous secret concerning the One Body?\n\nNo! These “spiritual things” could be declared and made known\nonly (verse 13) to “spiritual persons,” and the apostle says (3:1-6): “I\ncould not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.”\n\nThis, then, is evidently the scope of the whole context, and it\nshows us that to receive these “spiritual things” we must be “spiritual\npersons”: members of the One Body of Christ, rather than of one of\nthe many “bodies” of men. Then we shall be prepared to learn the\n“deep things of God,” which Were afterwards taught to these\nCorinthian saints by epistle in 1Co. 12:1-31+ [Note: See further on this\nsubject in a pamphlet on The Mystery, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n1Co. 4:4.-“For | know nothing by myself, yet am | not hereby justified.”\n\nLe., “For | am not conscious to myself of any [unfaithful, from verse\n2] thing, yet | am not justified by this; but he that judgeth me is the\nLord,” and He is able to bring all such hidden and secret things to\nlight. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “against\nmyself.”\n2Co. 3:16.-“Nevertheless when [their heart, from verse 15] shall turn\nto the Lord, the veil shall be taken away [from : i.e., “is taken away”\n(R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ), for it is the present tense,\nand is very emphatic because it explains why their heart shall turn to\nthe Lord! We might almost read it “When the veil is taken away from\n[their heart], it shall turn to the Lord.” See Mal. 4:6.\n2Co. 6:16.-“And what agreement hath the temple of God with [the\ntemple of] idols?”\n\n2Co. 11:14-15.-“And no marvel; for Satan himself transformeth himself\ninto an angel of light. Therefore it is no great [marvel] if his ministers\nalso transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end\nshall be according to their works:” whatever may be their present\nappearance or “reward.”\n\nThis is the most dangerous of all Satan’s “devices.” (1) He goes\nabout as “a roaring lion” (1Pe. 5:8), and we know that we must flee\nfrom him. (2) He beguiles through his subtilty, as “the old serpent”\n(2Co. 11:3), and there is great fear, lest we be “corrupted.” But (3),\nmost dangerous of all, he transforms himself into “an angel of light.”\nHere it is that God’s servants are deceived and “join affinity” with\nAhabs and Jezebels to “do (so-called) good”!\nEph. 3:17-19.-“That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye\nbeing rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with\nall saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to\nknow the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be\nfilled with all the fulness of God.”\n\nWe following the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nrendering and supplying the Ellipsis from the preceding clause:-\n\n“That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that\n(iva) ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to\napprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height\nand depth [of love is] even (τε) to know the love of Christ which\npasseth knowledge,” etc.\n\nWe are to be rooted as a tree, in love; we are to be founded as a\nbuilding in love; but we can never know what it is in all its length and\nbreadth and height and depth until we know Christ\'s love for us, for\nthat surpasses all knowledge.\n\nBengel beautifully explains the four terms: the “length” extending\nthrough all ages from everlasting to everlasting; the “breadth”\nextending to people from all nations; the “height” to which no man can\nreach or attain, and from which no creature can pluck us; its “depth,”\nso deep that it cannot be fathomed or exhausted. (see on this verse\nabove, page 18.)\n1Ti. 1:16.-“Howbeit, for this cause | obtained mercy that in me first\nJesus Christ might show forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them\nwhich should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.”\nHere πρῶτος (prétos), translated “first,” is the same word which is\ntranslated “chief in the preceding verse. If We retain this rendering,\nwe may also supply the Ellipsis from the same context, thus:-“That in\nme the chief [of sinners], Jesus Christ might show forth all long\nsuffering.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders “that in me\nas chief,” etc.\nHeb. 2:11.-“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified\nare all [sons] of one [father]: for which cause he is not ashamed to call\nthem brethren.”\nHeb. 7:4.-“Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even\nthe patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.”\n\nThere is here no word for “man” in the Greek, and we may better\nsupply the word “priest” from verse 3. “Now consider how great this\n[priest] was.”\nTit. 3:8.-“This is a faithful saying, and these things | will that thou\naffirm constantly.” The Greek reads, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , “concerning these.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] supply “things.” But we may repeat the\nword “heirs” from the preceding verse:-“That being justified by his\ngrace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\nThis is a faithful saying, and concerning these [heirs] | will that thou\naffirm constantly (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,\nconfidently), that they which have believed in God might be careful to\nmaintain good works.”\n\n1Jn. 2:2.-“He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but\nalso for the sins of the whole world.”\n\nThe words here are correctly repeated from the preceding clause.\nThe contrast is between “ours” and “the world.” A very emphatic word\nis here used for “ours,” not the genitive case of the ordinary pronoun\nἡμῶν (heemén) “our,” which is used in the first clause, but a special\npossessive pronoun, which is very emphatic, ἡμετέρος (heemeteros),\nour own. It is used of that which is peculiarly ours as distinct from that\nwhich belongs to others, e.g.:-\nAct. 2:11. We do hear them speak in our tongues.\n\nAct. 24:6. According to our law.\n\nAct. 26:5. Sect of our religion.\n\nRom. 15:4. Were written for our learning.\n\n2Ti. 4:15. He hath greatly withstood our words.\n\nTit. 3:14. And let ours also learn.\n\n4Jn. 1:3. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and his\nSon, Jesus Christ.\n\nSo that “our sins” refers to the writer and his People, as Jews, as\ndistinct from the rest of the world. Before this, propitiation was only for\nthe sins of Israel; but now, and henceforth, Christ\'s propitiation was for\nall without distinction, “out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,\nand nation”: not for all without exception, for then all must be saved,\nwhich is not the case.\n\nSee further on this verse under Synecdoche.\n\n(b) Where the omitted Verb is to be repeated from a preceding\nclause\nGen. 1:30.-The verb “/ have given” is correctly repeated in the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] from verse 29.\nGen. 4:24.-“If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy\nand sevenfold,” i.e., “Lamech [shall be avenged] seventy and\nsevenfold.”\n\nThis is spoken with reference to what is stated in the preceding\nverse, which is very obscure both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it “I have slain,”\nand margin “/ would slay,” while the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] renders it “I have slain a man for wounding me,” etc., and\nmargin “/ will slay.” But we must note that these words of Lamech\nwere called forth by the fact that through his son, who was “an\ninstructor of every artificer in brass and iron,” Lamech was in\npossession of superior weapons.\n\nThis is the earliest form of poetry in the Bible. It is significant that it\nshould be in praise of that violence which was soon to overspread the\nearth. It is in praise of the new weapons of war which Lamech had\nnow obtained; and so proud is he of his newly-acquired power, that if\nanyone injured him he declares that he would be so avenged that he\nwould outdo Jehovah in His punishment of Cain. See further for the\npoetical form, under Parallelism.\n\nDeu. 1:4.-“And Og, the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth [he\n(i.e., Moses) slew] in Edrei.” See Num. 21:33. Deu. 3:1.\n\n1К!. 20:34.-“Then said Ahab.” The verb must be repeated from the\npreceding clause.\n\nPsa. 1:5.-“Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, and\nsinners [shall not stand] in the congregation of the righteous.”\n\nThus, the blessing of the righteous is, that they do not stand\namong “sinners” (verse 1) now; and the punishment of the ungodly will\nbe that they shall not stand among the righteous in the judgment\n(verse 5).\n\nPsa. 45:3.-“Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, О most mighty: [gird\nthyself] with thy glory and thy majesty.”\n\nPsa. 126:4.-“Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the\nsouth.”\n\nThere must be a figure employed here, as the grammatical\nconstruction is not complete. There is neither subject nor verb in the\nsecond clause, as will be apparent if we set them forth, thus:-\nSubject.\nVerb.\nObject.\nО Lord as...\nturn again ...\nour captivity, the streams of the south.\n\nConsequently, it is clear that a figure is employed, and that this\nfigure is Ellipsis.\n\nThe correct supply of the Ellipsis will enable us to give a literal\ntranslation of the other words. The comparison employed shows us\nthat the verb required in the second sentence must be repeated from\nthe first.\n“Turn again our captivity, О Lord, as [thou turnest] the streams in\nthe south.” But this does not yield the whole sense, unless we see the\ncorrect and literal meaning of the words.\n\nThe word “streams” is aqbunH (apheekeem). It is from the root\nαφή (aphak) to put a force, constraint or restraint upon (Gen. 43:30;\nGen. 45:1. Est. 5:19).\n\nIt is the proper name for a narrow and practically inaccessible\nwater-course, either natural (in a gorge, or underground); or artificial\n(in an aqueduct), in which the water is forced, restrained, and turned\nabout by its strong barriers in various directions. It occurs eighteen\ntimes.* [Note:\n\n2Sa. 22:16. “The channels of the sea appeared.”\n\nJob. 6:15. “As the stream of brooks they pass away.”\n\nJob. 12:21. “He weakeneth the strength of the mighty” (i.e., the\napheekeem).\n\nJob. 40:18. “His [Behemoth’s] bones are as strong pieces of brass”\n(i.e., like apheekeem or aqueducts of brass).\nJob. 41:15. “His [Leviathan’s] scales are his pride” (marg., strong\npieces of shields).\n\nPsa. 18:15. “Then the channels of waters were seen.”\n\nPsa. 42:1. “As the hart panteth (marg., brayeth) after the water-\nbrooks:” i.e., the apheekeem. So also Joe. 1:20.\n\nPsa. 126:4. “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the\nsouth.”\n\nSong Son. 5:12. “His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers\nof waters” (1.6., inhabiting the rocky cliffs of the apheekeem).\n\nIsa. 8:7. “He [the king of Assyria] shall come up over all his\nchannels’ (i.e., over the rocky barriers of the apheekeem).\n\nEze. 6:3. “Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the\nhills, to the rivers, and to the valleys” (1.6., to the gorges and the\nvalleys, answering to the mountains and hills of the first line). So also\n36:4, 6.\n\nEze. 31:12. “His boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land.”\n\nEze. 32:6. “The rivers shall be full of thee.”\nEze. 34:13. “And feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the\nrivers.”\n\nEze. 35:8. “And in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with\nthe [sword.”\n\nJoe. 3:18. “All the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters.”] Six\ntimes with the word “sea” or “waters.” Thus in Psa. 42:1 and Joe. 1:20,\nthe hart is pictured TMOacbnynOonH (al apheekai mayim),\nover (not “for,” see Gen. 1:2, “darkness was upon the face of the\ndeep”; 1:20, “fowl that may fly above the earth,” etc.), above the\napheekai mayim. The hart hears the rushing of the waters far below in\ntheir rocky bed, and she “crieth out” (ТШВ (arag) to cry, to long for,\nonly here and Joe. 1:20) for the waters she cannot reach.\n\nThen as to the word rendered “south” ΦΡ6, Negeb). This is the\nproper name of a certain district in Canaan. It was “south” relatively to\nCanaan, but not absolutely. This is clear from Gen. 12:9, where we\nread, “Abram journeyed [from Bethel] going on still toward the south”\n(ΠΡΒΘΠ, the Negeb). Afterwards we read (13:1): “And Abram went\nup (north) out of Egypt ... into the south” (ΠΡΒΘΠ, the Negeb).t\n[Note: It is still more clear from Deu. 1:7, where we have four distinct\ntopographical names:-‘in the plain (ie., in ARABAH, the Jordan\nValley), in the hills (1.6., the HILL COUNTRY of Judah), and in the vale\n(i.e., in SHEPHELAH, the plain of Philistia), in the south” (i.e., in the\nNEGEB, the region south of the hill country of Judah).\n\nFor other passages, see Num. 13:17; Num. 13:29; Num. 21:1.\nDeu. 34:3. Jos. 10:40 : Jos. 12:8; Jos. 15:21. Jdg. 1:1-36 : 1Sa. 30:1.\nJer. 17:6.\n\nNoting these words, several passages are greatly elucidated, such\nas Jer. 32:44; Jer. 33:13. Zec. 7:7. Gen. 13:1, etc.]\nThe Negeb is intersected by deep and rocky gorges, or wadis,\ncalled “apheekeem.” Springs and wells are almost unknown in that\nregion.\n\nWe Can now take the literal signification of these words, and\nsupply the Ellipsis by repeating the verb of the first clause, in the\nsecond, and thus learn the meaning of the passage:-“Turn again our\ncaptivity, О Lord, as [thou turnest] the apheekeem in the Negeb,” i.e.,\nas those rushing waters are turned hither and thither by their mighty,\nrocky barriers, so Thou canst put forth Thy might, and restrain the\nviolence of our enemies, and turn us again (as the rocky cliffs and\nwalls turn about the apheekeem) into our own land.\n\nPro. 10:23.-“It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of\nunderstanding, hath wisdom,” i.e., “It is as sport to a fool to do\nmischief, but [fo exercise] wisdom [is as sport] to a man of\nunderstanding.”\n\nPro. 17:21.-“He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow,” i.e.,\nbegetteth him to his sorrow.\n\n1К!. 14:14.-“The Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel who shall\ncut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now,” i.e., “but\nwhat [do | say]? even now [has he raised him up]:” for Baasha, who\nwas to cut off the house of Jeroboam, had even then been born.\nChap. 15:27, etc. See under Aposiopesis.\n\n2Ki. 9:27.-“And Jehu ... said, Smite him also in the chariot, and they\ndid so,” i.e., “And [they smote him] at the going up to Gur.”\n\n1Ch. 2:23.-“All these belonged to the sons of Machir, the father of\nGilead.”\n\nHere the Ellipsis is arbitrarily supplied in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] by\nintroducing a new word into the text. The verb “took” must be repeated\nfrom the preceding clause, and not the verb “belonged” brought in\nfrom nowhere:-“And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair,\nfrom them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even threescore cities.\nAll these [fook] the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.”\n\nNeh. 5:4.-“There were also that said, We have borrowed money for\nthe king’s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.”\n\nHere the words “we have mortgaged’ must be repeated from verse\n3. Thus:-“There were also some that said, We have borrowed money\nfor the king’s tribute, [we have mortgaged] our lands and vineyards.”\nEcc. 10:1.-Here the Ellipsis is supplied by the words “so doth.” But it is\nbetter to repeat the verb, thus:-“As dead flies cause the ointment of\nthe apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so a little folly [causeth]\nhim that is in reputation for wisdom and honour [fo send forth an\noffensive odour).”\n\nIsa. 8:19-20.-“And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that\nhave familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:\nshould not a people seek unto their God? for [should] the living [seek\nunto] to the dead? To the Law and to the Testimony: if they speak not\naccording to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”\n\nAmo. 6:12.-“Shall horses run upon a rock? will one plow there with\noxen?” i.e., “Shall horses run upon a rock? will a husbandman plow [a\nrock] with oxen?”\n\nMar. 12:5.-“And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many\nothers [whom he sent, and they used them shametully, from verse 4],\nbeating some, and killing some.”\n\nMar. 14:29.-“Although all shall be offended, yet will not | [be\noffended].”\n\nLuk. 22:37.-“For | say unto you, that this that is written must yet be\naccomplished in me, And he was reckoned amongst the\ntransgressors: for the things [written] concerning me have an end.”\nThis was the last prophecy written of Him which was to be fulfilled\nbefore His betrayal, so He now abrogated a precept, necessary at the\npresentation of Himself, but no longer necessary now that He had\nbeen rejected, and was about to die. Now, therefore, they might not\nonly carry a sword, but buy one. So that He was only “reckoned” by\nman among the transgressors.\n\nJoh. 15:4.-“No more can ye, except ye abide in me,” {6., “No more\ncan ye [bear fruit] except ye abide in me” (see above, pages 12, 13).\nRom. 1:12.-‘That is, that | may be comforted together with you.” The\nverse begins in the Greek, τοῦτο δέ ἐστι (touto de esti), but this is. The\nverse reads, “But this [imparting to you some spiritual giff] is (or\nmeans) our being jointly comforted by our mutual faith.” He refers to\nhis desire to see these saints in Rome, and the verb is repeated from\nverse 11, “For | long to see you.”\n\nRom. 7:24-25.-“O wretched man that | am! who shall deliver me from\nthe body of this death? | thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”\n\nThe sense in this last clause is manifestly incomplete as an\nanswer to the previous question. Following the most approved\nreading, instead of “I thank God,” we take the more ancient words,\n“Thanks be to God,” [Note: Through not noticing the Ellipsis, attempts\nhave been made from the earliest times to get sense by altering the\ntext. The T.R. has 2ὐ222222ῶ 2ῷ 22ῷ, with Griesbach, Scholz, and A\nК L P a. But 222322 ?@ 22ῷ Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf,\nTregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort, and R.V. Also the Vatican ms.\nOthers read, “But thanks be to God,” and others, “It is the grace of\nGod” (DE), and others, “It is the grace of the Lord” (FG).] and repeat\nthe words from verse 24, thus:-“Who shall deliver me from the body of\nthis death? Thanks be to God, [He will deliver me] through Jesus\nChrist our Lord.”\n\nThe deliverance here desired is from the conflict between the old\nnature and the new, the flesh and the spirit.t [Note: It is to be noted\nthat “spirit” with a small “s” is one of the names given to the new\nnature which is implanted in every believer who is born again of the\nHoly Spirit; and this term “spirit” is to be distinguished from the Person\nof the Holy Spirit, from the context as well as from the absence of the\narticle. Even in Rom. 8:1-15, the Person of the Holy Spirit is not\nmentioned. Not until verse 16, “spirit of God” in 8:9 and 14 is divine\nspirit, 1.е., “divine nature” (2Pe. 1:4), “spirit of Christ” (8:9) is Pueuma-\nChristou, Christ-Spirit, another term for the new nature. So, “spirit of\nadoption” (verse 15) is “sonship-spirit,” and “the spirit of Him” (verse\n11) is “the new nature [given by] Him who raised up,” &c.]\n\nBut as the flesh is bound up with this “body of death,” i.e., this\ndying body, this mortal body, there is no deliverance except either\nthrough death and resurrection, or through that “change” which shall\ntake place at the coming of Christ.\n\nThe old heart is not changed or taken away, but a new heart is\ngiven, and these two are contrary the one to the other. They remain\ntogether, and must remain until God shall “deliver” us from the burden\nof this sinful flesh-this mortal body-by a glorious resurrection like unto\nChrist\'s. This deliverance is further described in 8:11 and 23; and it is\n“through Jesus” that our mortal bodies shall be raised again. See 1Th.\n4:14, διὰ Ἰησοῦ (dia leesou), “by means of Jesus,” and 1Th. 5:9 : “God\nhath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation ({6., full\ndeliverance from this body of sin and death) by (i.e., by means of, or\nthrough) our Lord Jesus Christ.”\nSee this passage under the Figures of Metonymy, Hypallage,\nEcphonesis, and Erotesis.\nRom. 8:19-21 may be explained thus:-\nExpectation.\nΑ 19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the\nmanifestation of the sons of God.\n\nThe Reason.\n\nВ 20-. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not\nwillingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the\nsame:\n\nExpectation.\nА -20. [Waiteth, | say (from verse 19)] in hope,\n\nThe Reason.\n\nΒ 21. Because the creature itself shall be delivered from the\nbondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the\nchildren of God.\n\nHere, A, corresponding with A, shows us that we are to repeat in\nthe latter member, A, the verb used in the former, A; the subject of\neach member being the same.\nRom. 8:33.-“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? /t is\nGod that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? /t is Christ that died.”\n\nWe have to remember that, while only the greater pauses are\nindicated in the ancient manuscripts, there is no authority for the minor\ninterpunctuation. This can generally be accurately gathered by the\ndevout student of the context. Here it is probable that the questions\nought to be repeated:-“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s\nelect? [Shall] God who justifieth [them]? Who is he that condemneth\n[them]? [/s if] Christ who died [for them]? Yea, rather; that is risen\nagain, etc.”\n1Co. 4:15.-“For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet\nhave ye not many fathers.”\n\nHere the verb “ye have’ is correctly repeated in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n1Co. 15:23.-“But every man [shall be made alive (from verse 22)] in\nhis own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at\nhis coming. Then the end,” i.e., not “then cometh the end,” for τὸ τέλος\n(to telos) is used of the last company of a body of soldiers.* [Note:\nHom. ΙΙ. 7, 380; 10, 470, etc.] τὸ τέλος (to telos) is the end: but of\nwhat, or what end, can be determined only by the context. Here the\nsubject is the various bodies τάγματα (tagmata) ranks, i.e., every man\nin his own proper band. Of these bands or ranks Christ is first; then\nthey that are Christ’s at His coming; then the last of these bands at the\nend of the thousand years (Rev. 20:5), when Christ shall deliver up the\nkingdom.\n\nThe second of these is not the resurrection foretold in 1Th. 4:16,\nas the privilege of those who are “in Christ,” but the “first” of the two\nresurrections referred to in the Old Testament, the Gospels, and the\nApocalypse.\n2Co. 1:6.-“And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation.”\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] supplies the verb substantive. It is better to\nrepeat the verb “[we are afflicted] for your consolation.”\n2Co. 3:11.-“For if that which is done away was glorious, much more\nthat which remaineth is glorious.”\n\nHere the two words διὰ δόξης (dia doxees), by means of glory, and\nἐν ббёл (en doxee), in glory, are both translated by the same word,\n“glorious,” while the verb substantive (“was” and “is”) is thus\nnecessarily, though incorrectly, supplied. The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] renders the verse, “For if that which passeth away\n(margin, is being done away) was with glory, much more that which\nremaineth is in glory.”\n\nBut, if we repeat the verbs already used by the Holy Spirit, we can\ntake the Greek literally:-“For if that which is done away [is done away]\nby glory (see verse 10), much more that which remaineth, [remaineth]\nin glory.”\n2Co. 12:2.-“Such an one [/ knew] caught up, etc.”\n\nThe verb ἁρπάζω (harpaz6) does not necessarily mean that the\ncatching is “up,” but rather “away.” In Mat. 11:12. Joh. 6:15. Act. 23:10\nit is rendered take by force. In Mat. 13:19. Act. 8:39 it is catch away. In\nJoh. 10:12 it is rendered “catch”; in Joh. 10:28-29, it is “pluck”; while in\nJud. 1:23 it is pull.\n\nSee also Eze. 8:3. Rev. 1:10. “Such an one [/ knew] caught away:”\nand this either with reference to place or time, i.e., caught away to\nsome present place (Act. 8:39-40), or to a vision of some future time\n(as in Eze. 8:3. Rev. 1:10; Rev. 4:2, etc.).\n\nGal. 2:7.-“The gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me,\nas the gospel of the circumcision was [committed] unto Peter.”\n\nGal. 5:17.-“For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit\nagainst the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other, so that\nye cannot do the things that ye would.”\n\nHere the word ἐπιθυμέω (epithumed) is connected with κατά\n(kata), against, i.e., to desire that which is against, or contrary to. The\nsame verb is used both of the flesh and of the spirit ({6., the new\nnature), and the Ellipsis of the verb with reference to the latter enables\nit to be used in its bad sense with regard to the flesh and in a good\nsense with regard to the spirit:-“For the flesh desires that which is\nagainst the spirit, and the spirit desires that which is against the flesh;\nand these desires are contrary to one another, so that ye cannot do\nthe things that ye would,” {Θ., so that your new nature is hindered\nofttimes in doing those good things that ye would, and, thank God,\nyour old nature is also hindered from doing the things which it lusts\nafter.\n\nEph. 1:13.-“In whom ye also trusted.” Here the verb is repeated from\nverse 12: but it seems rather that another verb should be repeated,\nfrom verse 11: “In whom ye also were allotted as God’s own\ninheritance,” for it is the inheritance which is the subject of the context\nand not the matter of trusting.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] neither sees, nor\nsupplies the Ellipsis, treating it as an Anacoluthon (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee] ).\n\nEph. 4:22.-We must repeat from verse 17, “[/ say also] that ye put off\nconcerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt\naccording to the deceitful lusts.”\n\n1Th. 2:11.-“Ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged\nevery one of you, as a father doth his children.”\n\nHere all three verbs are to be understood, /е., “as a father\n[exhorteth, and comforteth, and chargeth] his children.” (See under\nPolysyndeton).\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] better preserves the\norder of the Greek, supplying and treating the Ellipsis as absolute. “As\nye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own\nchildren, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, etc.”\n1Th. 4:14.-“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so\nthem also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”\n\nΠ.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :-“Even so them also that\nare fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”\n\nThe two clauses of this verse, as they are thus translated, are so\ninconsequent that the passage has been a source of difficulty to many,\nand is practically unintelligible. When this is the case we must ask\nwhether there is a figure employed, and, if so, what it is. Here it can be\nonly the figure Ellipsis. But what are the omitted words, which if\nsupplied will cause the passage to yield sense as to teaching, and\ncompleteness as to structure?\nBefore we can answer this question we must institute an enquiry\ninto the usage of the word translated “even:” as this is the key that will\nopen this lock, besides explaining and throwing light on many other\npassages. The word “even” here is καί (kai), and καί (ka/) is the\nordinary conjunction, and, which has two distinct senses, (1) and, (2)\nalso or even. It is the latter of these with which we are now concerned.\nIt is a matter of great importance that we should always know what is\nthe word which it emphasizes. In the Greek, this is never in doubt.*\n[Note: Nor is it in the Hebrew, as the @ is always joined to and forms\npart of the word with which it is connected.] But in English literature,\nincluding both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] ‚ its usage is very inconsistent and defective. In the Greek, kai,\nwhen it means also, is always placed immediately before the word\nwhich it emphasizes; while in English usage it may be placed either\nbefore or after the word. When we add to this that both in the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] it is often\ndissociated altogether from this word, the confusion and ambiguity can\nbe imagined.\n\nThe word kai is used in the sense of also some 636 times in the\nNew Testament.t [Note: See a pamphlet on the usage of the word\n“Also” in the New Testament, by the same author and publisher.]\n\nIn 258 of these it is placed (in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) after the word.\n\nIn 275 it is placed before the word, or in connection with another\nword to which it does not belong.\n\nIn 60 places it is not translated at all.\n\nIn 43 places it is rendered even, and placed before the word.\n\nSometimes the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] agree in this, and sometimes they differ.\n\nNow, remembering that the English word “also” must immediately\nfollow the word which it emphasizes, we ask what is that word here\n(1Th. 4:14)? As the Greek stands, it reads, “If we believe that Jesus\ndied and rose again, even so them which sleep in Jesus, GOD also\nwill bring with him.” But this yields no intelligible meaning. The hope\nthat is mentioned in the second clause cannot be conditioned on our\nbelief of the fact stated in the former clause.\n\nBut notice, before we proceed, that the preposition διά (dia), when\nit governs the genitive case, as it does here, denotes agency, and is\nrendered “by” 235 times, “through” 87 times, etc.; but “in” only 8 times.\nSee its use in the very next chapter (1Th. 5:9), “We are appointed to\nobtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ” (διὰ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ\nΧριστοῦ); Rom. 7:25, “1 thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord” (διὰ\nἸησοῦ Χριστοῦ); Rom. 5:9, “We shall be saved from wrath through\nhim” (δι ’ αὐτοῦ). No wonder therefore that the Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] , while translating it here “in Jesus,” says in\nthe margin, “Greek, through,” and adds the alternative rendering, “Will\nGod through Jesus bring.”\n\nThe one thought and subject is Resurrection, as the great and\nblessed hope of the Lord’s people. The three clauses are perfectly\nbalanced, as will be seen in the following structure of verse 14:-\n\nа If we believe (Belief)\n\nb that Jesus died (Death)\nс and rose again, (Resurrection)\n\nа — п №е manner [we believe] also (Belief)\n\nЬ — That them which are asleep (Death)\nο will God (by Jesus) bring with Him [from the dead].\n(Resurrection).\n\nHere in a and a we have the statement of our belief, in b and b we\nhave death (in b the death of Jesus, and in b the death of His saints),\nwhile in c and c we have resurrection (in c the resurrection of Jesus by\nGod, and in c the resurrection of His people by God), but in an\nexplanatory parenthesis it is explained that the Lord Jesus will be the\nagent, as the context goes on to show (see Joh. 5:21; Joh. 11:25;\nJoh. 11:43). It was God who brought Jesus from the dead (Heb.\n13:20). In like manner will He-by Jesus-bring His people from the\ndead.\n\nHence, we must repeat the verb “we believe” from the first clause:\n“If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, in like manner [we\nbelieve] also that God will, through Jesus, bring, with Him, them that\nare fallen asleep.”\n\nThis is the scope of the passage, which immediately goes on to\nexplain how this will be accomplished. We have the same hope\npresented in the same manner in Rom. 6:5; Rom. 8:11. 2Co. 4:14,\nviz., that Resurrection and Advent are the only hope of mourning\nsaints.\n\nHeb. 3:15.-“While it is said, To-day, etc.” (So R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ). The Greek is “ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι, Σήµερον,” “in (or by)\nits being said, To-day.”\n\nThe simplest solution of this confessedly difficult passage is to\nrepeat the exhortation from verse 13: “[As ye are exhorted] by the\nsaying, To-day, etc.”\n\nHeb. 4:7.-“Again [seeing] he limiteth,” from verse 6.\n\nHeb. 4:10.-“For he that hath entered into his rest, he himself also hath\nrested from his works, as God [rested] from his.”\n\nHeb. 7:8.-“And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth\nthem, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.”\n\nThe reference is clearly to Melchisedec, and it is not testified of\nhim that he now liveth. In Psa. 110:4 it is testified of Christ, “Thou art a\npriest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.” That which marked “the\norder of Melchisedec” as being different from “the order of Aaron” was\nthe fact that the days of Aaron’s order of priesthood began at 30 years\nof age, and ended at the age of 50 years, whereas the days of\nMelchisedec’s had neither such a beginning nor such a limitation: his\npriesthood had “neither beginning of days nor end of life,” but he\nremained a priest continually, ie., all his life (7:3). εἰς τὸ διηνεκές (eis\nto dieenekes) means for a continuance, the duration being determined\nby the nature of the context.\nIn chap. 7:1 it must mean that Melchisedec remained a priest all\nhis life; in chap. 10:1 it must mean that the sacrifices were continually\noffered until the end of the Mosaic dispensation; in 10:12 it means that\nthe one sacrifice of Christ is efficacious in perpetuity (or, with\nMacknight, that Christ offered only one sacrifice during His whole life);\nwhile in chap. 10:14 it means that the perfection arising from this\nsacrifice is limited only by the life of those who are sanctified.\nHence, here in 7:8 the Ellipsis may be thus supplied:-“And here\nmen that die receive tithes; but there [a man received them] of whom it\nis testified that he lived [a priest all his life.]’* [Note: The present tense\nis here (as is often the case) put (by the figure of Enallage (q.v.), or\n“Exchange’) for the preterite as in Act. 9:26), not believing that he is a\ndisciple (1.6., was); Heb. 7:3, he remaineth (i.e., remained); Mar. 5:15,\nthey come and see (1.6., came and saw); Joh. 1:29, John seeth (i.e.,\nsaw), Joh. 1:46, Philip findeth and saith (1.Θ., found and said); Joh.\n9:13, they bring him (1.Θ., they brought), etc., etc. In all such cases the\nfigure of Enallage marks the action which is thus emphasized.]\n\nAs Melchisedec was a priest all the days of his life, and his was a\nmortal life; so Christ was a Priest after the same order; and therefore,\nas His life is eternal, and has no limit, His priesthood (unlike that of\nAaron’s) must also be without limit, and He is “a priest for ever.”\n\nHeb. 12:25.-“See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they\nescaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall\nnot we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.”\nHere the words are correctly repeated from what precedes.\n\n2Pe. 1:19.-“We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto\nye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark\nplace, until the day dawn, and the day star arise; [taking heed, | say] in\nyour hearts.”\n\nIt cannot be that we are to take heed until we are illuminated by\nGod’s Spirit, or until we are converted! but that we are to take heed to\nthe word of prophecy in our hearts; for it is like a light shining in a dark\nplace. A light is for our eyes to see, and for our feet to use, but the\nprophetic word is for our hearts to be exercised with. This is contrary\nto popular theology. This word declares that the world is the “dark\nplace,” and prophecy is the only light we have in it, to which we do\nwell that we take heed. Popular theology says that prophecy is the\n“dark place,” and we “do well” to avoid it!\n1Jn. 3:10.-“Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not [born] of God,”\nfrom verse 9. So also verse 12, “Not as Cain, who was [born] of that\nwicked one.” Also verse 19, “We know that we are [born] of the truth.”\n2Jn. 1:2.-“[Loving you] for the truth’s sake,” from verse 1.\n2Jn. 1:12.-“Having many things to write unto you, | would not write\nwith paper and ink.”\n\nRev. 19:10.-“And | fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,\nSee thou do it not,” i.e., “See [thou worship me] not.”\n(c) Where an omitted Particle is to be repeated from the\npreceding clause\n(i.) Negatives\n\nThe negative is frequently omitted; and is generally supplied in the\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nDeu. 33:6.-“Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.”\n1Sa. 2:3.-“Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come\nout of your mouth.”\n1К!. 2:9.-“Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise\nman, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar\nhead bring thou down to the grave with blood.”\nThis has been a favourite text with “those that oppose themselves”\n(2Ti. 2:25). Misunderstanding the phrase, where David is called “a\nman after God’s own heart” (as though it referred to David’s character,\ninstead of to David’s calling, being chosen by God and not, as Saul\nwas, by man), infidels have pointed to 1Ki. 2:9 to show David’s\nfaithless and bloodthirsty character! But if, as in so many other cases,\nwe repeat the negative from the preceding clause, there is no such\ndifficulty: “but his hoar head bring thou [nof] down to the grave with\nblood.”\n\nTrue, Solomon did put Shimei to death, but this was for quite\nanother reason, and as Solomon said, Shimei’s blood was upon his\nown head (verse 37).\n\nThus the passage is brought into agreement with David’s oath to\nShimei, which is repeated in immediate connection with this verse\n(verse 8 from 2Sa. 19:23).\n\nPsa. 9:18.-“For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the\nexpectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.”\n\nHere the negative is supplied by the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in italics.\n\nPsa. 38:1.-“O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: and chasten me [nof]\nin thy hot displeasure.”\nPsa. 75:5.-“Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.”\n\nHere the negative is supplied, as it is in many passages.\nPro. 25:27.-ЧЁ is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search\ntheir own glory is not glory.”\nIsa. 38:18.-“For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate\nthee.”\n\nIt is open to question whether\nGen. 2:6 is one of these cases. The three verses 4-6 describe the\ncondition of the earth before the creation of man (verse 7), and before\nthe plants and herbs of the field grew. (Compare verses 4 and 9).\nThen three negative reasons are given why these did not grow:-(1)\n“For (rin) the Lord God had not (Ма) caused it to rain upon the\nearth, (2) апа (©) there was a man nowhere (ane) to till the ground,\n(3) and (68) [no] mist went up to water the whole face of the ground.”\n\n(ii.) Interrogatives\nМОД (lammah). Why?\nPsa. 2:1-2.-“Why do the heathen rage, and [why do] the people\nimagine a vain thing? [Why do] the kings of the earth set themselves,\nand [why do] the rulers take counsel together?”\n\nPsa. 10:1.-Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] repeats it: “Why (МОД) standest\nthou afar off, О Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?”\n\nЛОД (kammah). How oft?\n\nJob. 21:17.-“How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft\ncometh their destruction upon them!” Here the words “how off’ are\ncorrectly repeated in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] But why not repeat them also\nin the following sentences, instead of supplying the word “God,” and\ntranslate thus: “[How off] He distributeth sorrows in His anger! [How\noff] are they as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm\ncarrieth away! [How off] God layeth up calamity for his (i.e., the wicked\nman’s) children.* [Note: The R.V., missing the proper Ellipsis,\narbitrarily introduces the words “Ye say, God layeth up iniquity for his\nchildren,” taking the words as the words of the wicked man instead of\nthe children!] He recompenseth him and he shall know it; his eyes\nshall see his destruction, and he shall drink the wrath of the Almighty.”\nайк (eykh). How?\nPsa. 73:19.-“How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!\nthey are utterly consumed with terrors.” But it is better to repeat the\nword “how”:-“How are they utterly consumed with terror!”\nайлд (eykah). How!\n\nAn exclamation of pain and grief “How!” This gives its title to the\nbook of Lamentations in the Hebrew Canont [Note: The title in the\nEnglish Version is from the Latin Vulgate. See The Names and Order\nof the Books of the Old Testament, by the same author and publisher.]\n“Eykah.”\n\nThree prophets use this word of Israel:-Moses uses it of Israel in\nhis glory and pride (Deu. 1:12): Isaiah, of Jerusalem in her dissipation\n(Isa. 1:21): and Jeremiah, of Jerusalem in her desolation (Lam. 1:1,\netc.).\n\nHence, the word very frequently occurs in the book of\n\nLamentations; and its Ellipsis or omission is frequently to be supplied\nby repetition. In many cases this is done in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] Note,\nfor example:-\nLam. 1:1-2.-“How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how\nis she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and\nprincess among the provinces, how is she become tributary! 2. [How]\nshe weepeth sore in the night,” etc. 3. [How] is Judah gone into\ncaptivity ... 4. [How] the ways of Zion do mourn.”\nSee also 2:1, 2, etc.; 4:1, 4, 8, 10.\nОД (mah). How!\nJoe. 1:18.-“How (Ο/1) do the beasts groan! [How] are the herds of\ncattle perplexed!”\nTrOog (ad-meh). How long?\nPsa. 4:3.-“O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into\nshame? how long will ye love vanity?”\n\nHere the interrogative is repeated, but why not repeat it again\ninstead of supplying the word “and’? Thus:-“[How Jong] will ye seek\nafter leasing?”\n\nPsa. 89:46.-“How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? [How\nlong, Lord] shall thy wrath burn like fire?”\n\nTrOobn (ad-mahthai). How long?\nPsa. 94:3-4.-“Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the\nwicked triumph? How long shall they utter and speak hard things?\n[How long] shall all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?”\n(d) Where the omission of Connected Words is to be supplied by\nrepeating them out of a preceding clause\n\nThis form of Ellipsis, though it is very clear, is not always supplied in\n\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\n\nBible, 1611.]\n\nNum. 26:3-4.-“And Moses ... spake ... saying, Take the sum of the\n\npeople, from twenty years old and upward,” which words are correctly\n\nrepeated from verse 2.\n\nJos. 24:19.-“And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the\n\nLord: for he is an holy God,” etc.\n\nThe words must be supplied from verses 14-16: see also verses\n20, 23. Thus:-“Ye cannot serve the Lord [unless ye put away your\nidols], for he is a holy God,” etc.\n\nPsa. 84:3.-“Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a\nnest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O\nLord of hosts, my King and my God.”\nThere is evidently a figure here: for in what way could birds build\nnests and lay young in the altars of God? The one was covered over\nwith brazen plates, with fires perpetually burning and sacrifices\ncontinually being offered upon it; the other was overlaid with gold, and\nwas within the Holy Place! The question therefore is, What is the kind\nof figure here? It is the figure of Ellipsis, which the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have made worse by\ninserting the word “even” (the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in italic type, the R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] in Roman). It must be correctly supplied\nby repeating the words from the preceding clause: “so hath my soul\nfound thy altars, О Lord of hosts,” i.e., as the birds find, and love, and\nuse their house, so / find and love Thy house, my King and my God.\n\nIf we observe the structure of the passage,* [Note: See Key to the\nPsalms, p. 79. Edited by the same author.] we see how this supply of\nthe Ellipsis is necessitated:-\n\nа — 1. How amiable are thy tabernacles, О Lord of hosts!\n\nb 2. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the\nLord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\nο 3. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house,\nс — апа the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay\nher young,\nЬ even thine altars, О Lord of hosts, my King and my God.\nа — 4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still\npraising thee. Selah.\nThis structure at once puts c and c practically in a parenthesis, and\nb and b may be read on literally and connectedly without a break, and\nwithout any apparent Ellipsis; thus:-\nb 2. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the\nLord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God,\nЬ even thine altars, О Lord of hosts, my King and my God.\nBut Ь read after ο must have the Ellipsis supplied:-“The sparrow\nhath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself ... [so have /\nfound] thine altars, O Lord of hosts.”\nPro. 21:1.-“The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of\nwater: he turneth it whithersoever he will.”\nHere the second sentence is manifestly incomplete. There is a\nsubject, but there is no verb, and no object, as will be seen if we\npresent it in this way:-\nSubject. Verb. Object.\n\nThe King’s heart as the rivers of water\nis ..\n\nin the hand of the Lord. ...\n\nIt is clear from this that we have to supply both the verb and the\npredicate in the latter sentence. What they are to be will be seen more\nclearly when we translate the other words more correctly.\n\nThe expression “rivers of water” is in the Hebrew CbMBNOONH\n(palgey mayim). Palgey means divisions of, and is the plural construct\nof Φμβ (palag), to divide.t [Note: cbMB (palag), to divide, occurs\nonly in Gen. 10:25. 1Ch. 1:19. “In his days was the earth divided.” Job.\n38:25, “Who hath divided a watercourse,” and Psa. 55:9. “Destroy\ntheir tongues and divide them.”] The name of the Patriarch Peleg (i.e.,\ndivision) was so called “because in his days was the earth divided”\n(Gen. 10:25). The term palgey mayim* [Note: The word is used of any\nvery small artificial channel. The following are all the occurrences:-\n\nJob. 29:6. The rock poured me out rivers of oil.\n\nPsa. 1:3. Like a tree planted by the rivers of water.\n\nPsa. 46:4. A river the streams whereof shall make glad.\n\nPsa. 65:9. Enrichest it with the river of God.\n\nPsa. 119:136. Rivers of waters run down mine eyes.\nPro. 5:16. (And) rivers of waters in the streets.\n\nIsa. 30:25. Rivers and streams of waters.\n\nIsa. 32:2. As rivers of water in a dry place.\n\nLam. 3:48. Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water.] is the\ntechnical term for the little channels, or gullies, of water which divide\nthe Eastern garden into small squares of about 12 feet each, for\npurposes of irrigation. Hence the word is used for any little channel by\nwhich the water is distributed or divided, especially the channels which\ndivide-up a garden. It is used also of the trickling of tears. In Psa. 1:3,\nthe man who meditates in the law of God is like a tree planted by the\npalgey mayim, i.e., in a garden, where it will have a sure supply of\nwater and the constant care of the gardener! Not left out in the plain to\nshift for itself; to thrive if it gets water, and to die if it does not!\n\nThese little channels were filled by the gardener with water from\nthe spring, or well, or fountain, which every Eastern garden must\npossess; and then the water was sent first into one channel, then into\nanother, by the simple movement of his foot: “the land whither thou\ngoest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt from whence ye\ncame out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot,\nas a garden of herbs” (Deu. 11:10). The gardener did not deign to use\na tool, or to stoop down and use his hands. By simply moving the foot\nhe dammed up one little stream, or by a similar movement he\nreleased the water in another.\n\nNow we are able to supply the Ellipsis correctly in this verse:-\n\n“The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the palgey mayim\n[are in the hand of the gardener): He turneth it whithersoever He will.”\n\nTo an Eastern mind this would be perfectly clear without the supply\nof the Ellipsis. Just as in England the expression, “A coach and four” is\nperfectly clear, and the supply of the Ellipsis “horses” is wholly\nunnecessary. But an Esquimaux or a South Sea Islander, or an Arab,\nwould ask, “A coach and four what?” It would be unintelligible to him,\nwhile with us it needs no explanation.\n\nSo when we learn and understand the customs and peculiarities of\nthe East we can often supply the Ellipsis from such knowledge, as\nEasterns would supply it naturally.\n\nThe teaching of the passage then is that just as the little channels\nof water in a garden are turned about by the gardener by the simple\nmovement of his foot, so the king’s heart is as easily turned about by\nthe Lord, “whithersoever He wills.”\nOh how full of comfort for ourselves, for our friends, for our\nchildren, to know this, and to be assured of it! “On that night could not\nthe king sleep” (Est. 6:1). A sleepless night! The king’s heart turned-\nthe law of the Medes and Persians reversed-and Israel delivered. Oh\nhow simple! Let us never again limit His almighty power-for it is\nalmighty power that is required to turn the heart of man. We know how\ndifficult it is to convince even a friend on the simplest matter of fact.\nBut let us remember that the heart of even an Eastern despot is as\neasily turned by the Lord’s mighty hand as the palgai mayim are\nturned by the simple movement of a gardener’s foot.\n\nJob. 3:23.-“Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom\nGod hath hedged in?”\nHere the words, “why is light given,” are correctly repeated from\nverse 20. This expression about giving light is similar to that of “seeing\nthe sun” (6:5, and 7:5). Both are idioms (α.ν. [Note: Which 5εε.] ) for\nliving or being alive, as is clear from verses 20, 21. “Wherefore is light\ngiven,” i.e., why is life prolonged, in the case of those who are in\nmisery and long for death?\n\nThe latter part of the verse may be cleared by noting that the word\n“hid,” as applied to “a way,” differs from that in Psa. 2:12. In Psa. 2:12\naor (avad) is to lose a way which is already known. Here, it is СЪШ\n(sathar) which implies that the way is not known at all. It hides itself. In\nthis case God has hidden it and it cannot be found.\n\nWhat good is life, Job complains, to a man if God has completely\ncovered up the way? The word СЛК (sakak), rendered “hedged in,”\nrefers to the way, not to the man, and means, not “hedged in,” but\ncovered up (see 38:8). It is not the same word as 1:10 (which is μίθκ\n(sook), to hedge in), nor as 19:8, as indicated in the margin (which is\nBFLL (gadar) to fence up).\n\nEcc. 7:11-12 has evidently given some trouble, as is clear from the\nitalics in Text and margin both of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.]\n\n“Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to\nthem that see the sun.” Margin, “as good as an inheritance, yea, better\ntoo.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads:-“Wisdom is as\ngood as an inheritance: yea, more excellent is it for them that see the\nsun.” Margin, “is good together with an inheritance: and profitable unto\nthem,” etc.\n\nWe must take TH (im), with, in its idea of accompaniment, in\ncommon with, i.e., like or as (see Gen. 18:23; Gen. 18:25. Job.\n3:14-15; Job. 9:26; Job. 21:8; Job. 40:15. Psa. 73:5; Psa. 73:25; Psa.\n143:7. Ecc. 2:16), and translate:-\n\n“Wisdom is good, as an inheritance is good, and more excellent to\nthem that see the sun” (i.e., for living men, see above under Job.\n3:23). For to be in (6; b, which is ignored by A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) the shelter (LIM, tze/, Gen.\n19:8; Num. 14:9; Psa. 17:9) of wisdom [is more excellent than to be]\nunder the shelter (6) of money; and the advantage of wisdom is that\nwisdom preserveth the life of them that possess it.”\n\nThat is to say, briefly, wisdom is good: and money is good, but\n\nwisdom has this advantage over money; it can preserve life, while an\ninheritance or money cannot.\nZec. 14:18.-The verse reads in the Hebrew (see margin):-“And if the\nfamily of Egypt go not up, and come not, not upon them there shall be\nthe plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up\nto keep the feast of tabernacles.”\nHere, there is evidently a figure: because, read with verse 17,\nthere is not only no sense, but quite an opposite sense to that which is\nclearly intended. Our duty is to ask, What is the figure? For we are not\nat liberty to suggest an alteration of the Text, or to make even a free\ntranslation of it. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] resorts\nto the easy method of suggesting in the margin: “The text is probably\ncorrupt.” This is a very common practice of commentators! It never\nseems to enter their heads that the difficulty lies with themselves. It\nwould have been more becoming to have said, “Our understandings\nare probably at fault’! The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\narbitrarily inserts words, as does the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , and even then\nboth Versions fail to make sense.\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] says: “That have no rain” (marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] ‚ “upon whom there is ποῦ).\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “Neither shail it be\nupon them” (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , “shall there not be upon them\nthe plague?’ etc.).\n\nThe Ellipsis is Correctly and simply supplied by repeating “there\nshall be no rain” from the preceding clause: which, describing\nmillennial days, says:-\n\n“Whoso will not come up of а/ the families of the earth unto\nJerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them\nshall be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not,\nnot upon them [shall there be no гат];* [Note: Because Egypt has no\nrain, as it is, and is therefore thus excepted here.] there shall be the\nplague, [aforesaid, verse 12] wherewith the Lord will smite the\nheathen that come not up to the feast of tabernacles.”\n\nMat. 2:10.-“When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding\ngreat joy:” i.e., “When they saw the star [standing over where the\nyoung child was], they rejoiced.” The words are to be repeated from\nverse 9.\n\nMat. 13:32.-“Which indeed is the least of all seeds [which a man takes\nand sows in a field];” from verse 31; i.e., not the least, absolutely, but\nrelatively, as to those seeds which are usually sown in the field.\n\nMar. 5:23.-“And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth\nat the point of death: / pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that\nshe may be healed.”\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] adds: “/ pray thee,” but it is better to repeat the\nverb from the beginning of the verse, and then we may take the other\nwords literally:-“! beseech thee earnestly that having come thou\nwouldest lay on her thy hands,” etc.\n\nJoh. 1:18.-“No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten\nSon, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.” Here\nthe sense is to be completed by repeating the words from the\npreceding clause, thus: “No man hath seen God at any time; the only\nbegotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath [seen God,\nand] declared [the Father].”\n\nJoh. 9:3.-Here the Ellipsis is to be supplied from verse 2. “Neither\nhath this man sinned, nor his parents [that he should be born blind]:\nbut that the works of God should be made manifest in him.” See below\n(page 107).\n\nRom. 4:12.-“And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the\ncircumcision,” etc.\nHere the words are to be repeated from the preceding\nclause:-“And the father of the circumcision [that righteousness might\nbe imputed] to them who are not of the circumcision only, but also\nwalk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had\nbeing yet uncircumcised.”\n\nRom. 5:3.-“And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also,” i.e., “And\nnot only do we [rejoice in hope of the glory of God], but we glory also\nin tribulations.”* [Note: In the Greek the emphasis is on the verb\n“glory.” “We GLORY also in tribulations,” i.e., we not only have them\nlike all other people, but by grace we are able to glory in them. For the\nusage of the word “also” see page 90.]\n\nRom. 5:11.-“And not only so:” i.e., “And not only [are we saved from\nwrath through him], but we alsot [Note: In the Greek the emphasis is\non the word “joy.” “We JOY also in God.” See a pamphlet on the\nbiblical usage of the word Also, by the same author and publisher.]\njoy in God [as our God] through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we\nhave now received the reconciliation.”\n\nIt is at this point that the great doctrinal portion of Romans divides\ninto two portions. It runs from 1:16 to 8:39. Up to 5:11 the subject is\n“sins”: from verse 12 it is “sin.” Up to this point the subject is the\nproducts of the old nature: from this point it is the old nature itself. Up\nto 5:11 it is the fruits of the old tree: from 5:12 it is the old tree itself. Up\nto this point we are considered as “in the flesh”: from this point we are\nconsidered as “not in the flesh,” but the flesh is in us. [Note: See\nfurther, on this, a series of articles in Things to Come commencing\nSeptember, 1898.]\n\nRom. 7:7.-“What shall we say then? [that] the law [ἱ5] sin? God forbid!\nNay, | had not known sin but by (or through) the law; for | had not\nknown lust [fo be sin] except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\nBut [/ say that] (from verse 7) sin taking occasion by the\ncommandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence (or\ndesire). For without the law sin [is] dead.”\n\nRom. 8:23.-“And not only they,” i.e., “And not only [every creature\ngroaneth], but ourselves also,” etc.\n\nRom. 9:10.-“And not only this,” i.e., “And not only [was there that\nlimitation of the promise to this son], but when Rebecca also had\nconceived [twins] by one, even by our father Isaac ... it was said unto\nher, The elder shall serve the younger.”\n\nRom. 10:8.-“But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy\nmouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach [is\nnigh thee].”\n\n1Co. 15:42.-“So also is the resurrection of the dead.” Here instead of\nusing the verb substantive we must repeat the words from verses 37\nand 41, and then we can preserve the proper emphasis shown by the\nposition of kai “also”:-“So the RESURRECTION also of the dead [is\nwith a different body.” This preserves the harmony of the whole\nargument.\n\n2Co. 8:19.-“And not that only,” i.e., “And not only [is his praise\nthroughout all the churches], but he was chosen* [Note: In the Greek\nthe emphasis is on the word “chosen”:-“CHOSEN also.”] also of the\nchurches to travel with us with this grace (or gift),” etc.\nCol. 3:4.-“When Christ, who is our life, shall appear.” It is a question\nwhether this Ellipsis should be supplied (as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) by the verb substantive, or\nwhether the words should be repeated from the preceding verse,\n“When Christ, [with whom] our life [is hid], shall appear, then shall ye\nalso appear with him in glory.” Many ancient MSS., with Lachmann\n(margin), Tischendorf, Tregelles, R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] margin, read “your life.”\n\n2Ti. 1:7.-“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power,\nand of love, and of a sound mind.”\n\nHere, by way of contrast, the words are to be repeated in the\nsecond clause: “but [God hath given to us the spirit] of power, and of\nlove, and of a sound mind.”\n\nMore properly it should be “a” spirit, not “the spirit,” and the fact\nthat a noun is used (by the figure of Enallage, q.v. [Note: Which see_] )\ninstead of an adjective, shows us that the emphasis is to be placed on\nthe adjective. “a COWARDLY spirit,” πνεῦμα δειλίας (рпеита deilias);\nδειλίας (deilias), means timidity, fearfulness, cowardice, and always in\na bad sense (see the verb δειλιάω (deiliad), Joh. 14:27. The adjective,\nMat. 8:26. Mar. 4:40. Rev. 21:8).\n1Jn. 2:19.-Here the Ellipsis is correctly supplied in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “they\nwent out.”\n1Jn. 5:15.-“And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask\n[according to his will], we know that we have the petitions that we\ndesired of him.”\n\nHere the words, “according to His will,” are to be supplied from the\npreceding verse.\n2. Where the omitted word is to be supplied out of a Succeeding\n\nClause\n\nJos. 3:3.-“When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God,\nand the priests the Levites bearing it [going before], then ye shall\nremove from your place, and go after it.”\n\nHere the words “going before” are necessitated, and are to be\nsupplied from the words that follow-“go after.”\nJdg. 16:13-14.-“If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the\nweb, [and fastenest them with a pin in the beam (from verse 14), then\nshall | be weak and be as another man (from verses 7 and 11)]: and\nshe fastened it with the pin, etc.” The Arabic and Vulgate Versions\nsupply these words to complete the sense. See Appendix C.\nHomeeoteleuton, where it is shown that this is not really an Ellipsis,\nbut an ancient omission on the part of some scribe.\n1Sa. 16:7.-“The Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance,\nor on the height of his stature; because | have refused him: for the\nLORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward\nappearance (Heb. on the eyes), but the Lord looketh on the heart.”\nHere the verb “seeth” is correctly repeated from the succeeding\nclause. It is not necessary to repeat “the Lord,” though it is true, and\ngreatly beautifies the English. It may be simply “for it is not as man\nseeth,” or, “for / see not as man seeth,” which comes to the same\nthing.\n1К!. 3:12.-“Lo, | have given thee a wise and understanding heart; so\nthat there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any\narise like unto thee,” i.e., among the kings, which words follow in verse\n13. See also 10:23.\n1К!. 14:15.-“For the Lord shall smite Israel, [shaking him] as a reed is\nshaken in the water.”\n1Ch. 4:7.-“And the sons of Helah were, Zereth, and Jezoar, and\nEthnan, [and Coz]”: supply from verse 8.\nSo, at the end of verse 13 supply “Meonotha/’ from verse 14.\nAlso, in chap. vi., at end of verse 27, supply “Samuel his son“from\nverse 28.* [Note: In this verse there is a strange confusion. Samuel’s\nor Shemue\'\'s firstborn was Joel, see verse 33. Vashni (CLU6LU) is\nnot a proper name, but means “the second.” And the verse reads,\n“And the sons of Samuel, the firstborn [Joel, verse 33], the second\nAbiah.” See 1Sa. 8:2, and see also above, page 5.]\n\nIn chap. vii. at end of verse 18 supply “and Shemidah” from verse\n19.\n\nIn chap. viii. at end of verse 7 add “and Shaharaim” from verse 8.\n\nIn chap. xxv. at end of verse 3 add “and Shime/’ from verse 17,\nwhere he is named. In verse 3 only five out of the six are named. In\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] Shimei’s\nname is supplied in the margin.\n\nNeh. 5:2.-“For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,\n[being] many, [are mortgaged],” supply from verses 3, 4, 5.\n\nJob. 20:17.-Here the word “floods” means, as in the margin and R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , streaming or flowing, and\nbelongs to the word “brooks.” But it must be repeated also before the\nword rivers, thus:-“He shall not see the flowing rivers, the flowing\nbrooks of honey and butter.”\nJob. 38:19.-The Ellipsis is to be supplied thus:-“Where is the way [to\nthe place where] light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the\nplace thereof?”\nPsa. 35:16.-“With hypocritical mockers in feasts,” i.e., repeating the\nlatter words of the former sentence.\n“With hypocrites [at feasts], mocking at the feast,” i.e., like\nparasites who, for the sake of their belly, flatter others.\nPro. 13:1.-“A wise son heareth his father’s instruction: but a scorner\nheareth not rebuke.” Here the Ellipsis is plain, and is correctly supplied\nin the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.]\nIsa. 19:11.-“How say ye unto [the wise] Pharaoh, | am the son of the\nwise?” etc.\nIsa. 31:5.-“As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.”\nHere the word “birds” is feminine. It refers therefore to female\nbirds, and to maternal love: “As mother-birds fluttering (see Deu.\n32:11), or as fluttering birds [defend their young (from the next clause)]\nso will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.”\n\nOne of the words for defend is ФСеЗ, (pahsék), from CDE3\n(pasak), Passover. cbe3 (pasak) means primarily to halt (see Isa.\n35:6. Lev. 21:18. 2Sa. 4:4). So 1Ki. 18:21, “How long halt ye\n(cpe3in) between two opinions?” Heb., as birds hop backwards and\nforwards on two boughs. Hence in Exo. 12:13, it is not “when | see the\nblood, | will pass over you;” but, it is cbc3bn ТМЛН, “I will halt or\nstop at you, and the plague shall not be upon you,” i.e., Jehovah will\nstop or halt at (TIM) the door and not suffer the destroyer to enter. So\nthe precious blood of Christ stops the hand of justice, and is a perfect\ndefence to the sinner who is sheltered by it.\n\nHab. 2:3.-“For the vision [is deferred] for an appointed time,” which\nword is clearly implied in the following sentence. See also Mal. 1:10.\nLuk. 1:17.-“And [the hearts of the] disobedient to the wisdom of the\njust.”\n\nLuk. 22:36.-The Greek reads, “He that hath not, let him sell his\ngarment and buy a sword.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] boldly, correctly,\nand idiomatically supplies the Ellipsis in the first member from the\nfollowing sentence:-“He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment\nand buy one” (see on Luk. 22:37 above).\nJoh. 6:32.-“Moses gave you not that bread from heaven,” i.e., “that\n[true] bread,” from the succeeding clause: “But my Father giveth you\nthe true bread from heaven.”\n\nJoh. 6:35.-I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never\nhunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” The exquisite\nEnglish of this can never be improved. As an idiomatic version it is\nperfect. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] in attempting a\nmore literal translation is very lame: “not hunger” and “never thirst.” If\nwe are to be literal, we must supply the Ellipsis by repeating the word\nπώποτε (pépote), at any time, from the end of the verse. Both\nVersions practically ignore it by including it in the word “never.”\n\n“He that cometh to me shall in no wise hunger [at any time]; and\nhe that believeth on me shall in no wise thirst at any time,” ie.,\n“never,” as expressed thus in both sentences in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nIt is very instructive to note that the negative here is most\nemphatic, a doubled negative, which signifies, by no means, in no\nwise, in no case; and it is very solemn to notice that whenever it was\nused by man, man was never able to make good his asseveration,\ne.g., Peter, in Mat. 16:22, said, “This shall not be unto thee,” but it\nwas. Again in 26:35 he said, “Yet will | not deny thee,” and in Mar.\n14:31, “I will not deny thee in any wise,” but Peter did deny the Lord\nJesus! His enemies, in Joh. 11:56, declared, “He will not come to the\nfeast,” but He did! Peter, in Joh. 13:8, declared, “Thou shalt never\nwash my feet,” but Jesus did! Thomas, in Joh. 20:25, declared, “I will\nnot believe,” but he did, and that without fulfilling his condition!* [Note:\nIn all this we have a solemn warning to let our yea be yea, and our\nnay nay (Mat. 5:37).] On the other hand, how sure, how true, how\ncertain are the declarations of the Lord Jesus when made with this\nsame positiveness. Among others note:-\n\nMat. 5:18. “One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the\nlaw till all be fulfilled.”\n\nMat. 5:20. “Except your righteousness exceed the\nrighteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no\ncase enter into the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nLuk. 22:34. “The cock shall not crow this day.” Joh. 13:38.\n\nJoh. 6:37. “Him that cometh unto me, | will in no wise cast out,”\nié., no never, no never cast out.\n\nHeb. 8:12. “Their sins and their iniquities will | remember no\nmore,” {6., in no wise will | remember any more.\nHeb. 13:5. “I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.”\n\n1Pe. 2:6. “He that believeth on him shall not be confounded.”*\n[Note: For other examples see Joh. 4:14; Joh. 8:12; Joh.\n10:28. Rom. 4:8. 1Th. 4:15; 1Th. 5:3. Heb. 10:17. 2Pe.\n1:10. Rev. 3:12, etc.\n\nAll these are the immutable promises and purposes of the\nliving God, and though we are to “cease from man, whose\nbreath is in his nostrils,” the word of the Lord endureth for\never. See further under the figure called Repeated\nNegation, below.]\n\nJoh. 9:2.-“And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,\nthis man [that he is blind], or his parents, that he was born blind?”\n(See above, page 101).\n\nJoh. 12:25.-“He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his\nlife in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.”\n\nHere two expressions are to be repeated from the latter clause, in\nthe former:-“He that loveth his life [in this world] shall lose it [unto\neternity.”\n\nAct. 2:3.-“And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of\nfire, and it sat upon each of them,” i.e., the Holy Spirit, as is clear from\nthe next verse.\nThe verse may be rendered:-“And there appeared unto them,\ndistributed, tongues like as of fire; and he [the Holy Ghost] sat (or\ndwelt) upon each of them.” The tongues were not divided into two\nparts, as suggested by the popular term “cloven tongues,” but they\nwere divided, or distributed, among the Twelve.\n\nAct. 7:59.-“And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying,\nLord Jesus, receive my spirit.”\n\nThe Greek reads, “calling upon and saying.” There is evidently an\nEllipsis after the verb “calling upon,” which the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nsupplies with the word “God.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] supplies the word “Lord.”\n\nThe meaning is clear, that Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost\naddressed his prayer to Christ, and his words were “Lord Jesus,\nreceive my spirit.”. Both words must therefore be repeated\nthus:-“calling upon the Lord Jesus and saying [Lord Jesus] receive my\nspirit.” By this Ellipsis the emphasis is thrown on the act of invocation\nand shows that this act of prayer was addressed to the Lord Jesus,\nie., Lord, who art Jesus: or, Jesus who art the Lord.\n\nWhere two substantives are placed together in the same gender,\nnumber and case, the latter is in apposition to, and is explanatory of\nthe former; or, there is an Ellipsis of the words of explanation, “that is\nto say,” or “that is.” Sometimes this is supplied by the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nsometimes it is not. See Deu. 22:8, “a damsel that is a virgin.” Jdg.\n11:1, margin, “a woman an harlot.” Gen. 13:8, margin, “men brethren.”\nNum. 32:14, “an increase of sinful men,” the Hebrew reads:-“an\nincrease of men who are sinners.” Mat. 18:23, “a certain King”; Greek,\n“a man that is a King,” as in 20:1, where the Ellipsis is supplied, “a\nman that is an householder.” Luk. 2:15, margin, 24:19, “a prophet”;\nGreek, “a man that is a prophet.” Act. 2:29, “men and brethren”;\nGreek, “Men who are brethren,” and verse 22, “men of Israel”; Greek,\n“men who are Israelites.” So here, Act. 7:59, “Lord, who art Jesus”-\ncompare Rev. 22:20.\nRom. 2:12.-“For as many as have sinned without law, shall perish also\nwithout [being judged by] law: and as many as have sinned in the law\n(or under law) shall be judged by the law.”\nRom. 2:28-29 is an elliptical passage in the Greek, which the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] covers by a free translation.\n\nAdhering to the order and literal meaning of the words in the\noriginal, we must translate and supply as follows:-\n“For not he that [is a Jew] outwardly, is a Jew, neither that which [is\ncircumcision] outwardly in the flesh, is circumcision; but he that [/s a\nJew] inwardly, is a dew, and circumcision of heart in the spirit and not\nin the letter [is circumcision].”\n\nRom. 4:13.-This verse is translated very freely in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nFollowing the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , we may\nsupply the Ellipsis from the end of the verse, which it has missed:-“For\nnot through [righteousness of] law was the promise [made] to\nAbraham, or to his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, but\nthrough righteousness of faith.”\nRom. 5:16.-“Also not as [the judgment or sentence came] through one\nthat sinned [/s] the free gift: for the judgment (κρῖμα) [was] after one\n[transgression] unto condemnation (κατάκριµα); but the free gift is\nafter many offences unto δικαίωµα ({8., a righteous acquittal).” (See\nbelow, page 111).\nN.B.-It is not δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee) which is the attribute of\nrighteousness; nor is it δικαίωσις (dikaidsis) which is the act of the\nJudge in justifying; but it is δικαίωµα (dikaiéma) which is the outcome\nof the act, the just thing done.\n1Co. 1:26-27.-“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many\nwise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,\nbut God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the\nwise,” etc.\n\nHere the words “are called” are repeated from the preceding\nclause, but “are chosen,” i.e., to confound, etc., might be supplied\nfrom the succeeding clause. (See above page 58).\n1Co. 5:4-5.-we must supply in verse 4 the verb “to deliver” from verse\n5-\n\nπο deliver] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye, and my\nspirit, being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus\nChrist), to deliver [/ say] such an one unto Satan for the destruction of\nthe flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.”\n1Co. 6:12.-“All [meats (from verse 13)] are lawful unto me [fo еай, but\nall are not profitable; (see 10:33) all [meats] are lawful for me [fo еай,\nbut | will not be brought under the power of any [теай. Compare\n10:23.\n1Со. 14:22.-“But prophesying [is for a sign (from previous sentence)]\nnot for them that believe not, but for them which believe.”\n1Со. 15:47.-“The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man, the\nLord from heaven, [is heavenly (from verse 48).” See above on Act.\n7:59, as to these two nouns, “the second man [who is] the Lord.”\n2Co. 5:10.-“That every one may receive the things done in his body,\naccording to that he hath done, whether good or bad.”\n\nHere the verb “done” is correctly supplied from the succeeding\nclause.\nEph. 2:1.-There is evidently an Ellipsis in this verse; which has been\nvariously supplied by translators; the usual mode being to Supply the\nwords from a succeeding clause (verse 5) as in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So in\nthe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ‚ “did he quicken.” But it 15\nworth consideration whether it may not be supplied from 1:19, 20, “the\nexceeding greatness of his power to us-ward, who believe, according\nto the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when\nhe raised him from the dead ... and you [when you were raised in\nHim, and quickened with Him] were dead in trespasses and sins,” etc.\nIt may also be supplied by repeating the verb from 1:23, “Which is\nhis body, the fulness of him which filleth all [his saints] with all [spiritual\ngifts]. And you [hath he thus filled] who were dead in trespasses and\nsins “(chap. 2:1): καὶ ὑμᾶς ὄντας, “and you when ye were,” must be\ncompared with verse 5, καὶ ὄντας ἡμᾶς, “and we when we were.” This\npoints to the use of the verb “quickened” in each case.\n\nPhp. 3:13.-“Brethren, | count not myself to have apprehended [the\nprize (from verse Ί4)]: but this one thing / do, forgetting those things\nwhich are behind [me], and reaching forth unto those things which are\nbefore [me], etc.”\n\n2Ti. 1:5.-“When | call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in\nthee.”\n\nThere is no verb in the Greek, and the words that is should have\nbeen placed in italics. The Greek reads, “Taking remembrance of the\nunfeigned faith [dwelling in thee (from the succeeding clause)], which\ndwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and | am\npersuaded that [it dwelleth] in thee also.” Here it is repeated from the\npreceding clause.\nTit. 2:2.-“That the aged men be sober, grave, etc.” Supply the verb\n“exhort’ from verse 6 here, and also in verses 4 and 9:-“[Exhort] that\nthe aged men be sober, etc.”\nHeb. 8:1.-“We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand\nof the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,” {6., “such a high priest\n[as became us]” (from 7:26).\nIl. Complex: Where both Clauses are Involved\n\nAn abbreviated form of expression, in which an Ellipsis in the first of\ntwo members has to be supplied from the second, and at the same\ntime an Ellipsis in the second member has to be supplied from the\nfirst.\n\nSimple Ellipsis puts one member, and leaves the other to be\ninferred.\n\nComplex Ellipsis puts two members, and implies two others, and\nthese two are interchanged. Hence this figure has been called\n“Semiduplex Oratio,” i.e., semi-double discourse.\n1. Where single words are involved\nPro. 10:1.-“A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son {5 the\nheaviness of his mother.”\n\nHere the word “father” in the former clause is to be understood in\nthe latter; and the word “mother” in the latter clause is to be\nunderstood in the former. For a wise son is a joy to a mother as well\nas to a father, and a foolish son is a heaviness to a father as well as to\na mother.\n\nSee also chaps. 15:20; 17:25; 23:24; 30:17.\n\nMat. 23:29.-“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\nbecause ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the\nsepulchres of the righteous.”\n\nHere the word “build” refers also to the “sepulchres” of the latter\nclause; and the word “garnish” refers also to the word “tombs” of the\nformer clause.\n\nLe., ye not only build the tombs of the prophets, but ye garnish\nthem: ye not only garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, but ye build\nthem.\nRom. 5:16.-“And not as it was by one that sinned so {5 the gift: for the\njudgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many\noffences unto justification.”\n\nThere is evidently an Ellipsis here, as is shown by the italics\nemployed in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] But the question is, Is the omission correctly supplied? We\nsubmit the following, treating the first clause as a complex Ellipsis:-\n\n“And not, as [the judgment came] by one that sinned, [does] the\nfree gift [come by one who was righteous]: for the judgment [was\ndeath] after one [offence] to condemnation, but the free gift [is pardon]\nafter many offences, unto justification;” i.e., Adam brought the\njudgment of death by one sin, Christ by bearing that judgment,\nbrought life and pardon for many sins. (See above, page 108).\n\nRom. 10:10.-“With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and\nwith the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”\n\nHere “righteousness” is to be understood in the latter clause, as\nwell as “salvation”; and “salvation” is to be understood in the former\nclause, as well as “righteousness.” Moreover “confession” must be\nmade with the heart as well as with the mouth; and righteousness\nincludes salvation. The full completion of the sense is:-“With the heart\nman believeth unto righteousness [and salvation] and with [the heart\nand] the mouth confession is made unto [righteousness and]\nsalvation.”\n\n2. Where Sentences are involved\nPsa. 1:6.-“For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way\nof the ungodly shall perish.”\nIn the former sentence we have the cause, in the latter the effect.\nBut both effect and cause are latent in each statement: “The Lord\nknoweth the way of the righteous [and it shall not perish], but [the Lord\nknoweth] the way of the ungodly [and if] shall perish.”\n\nPsa. 42:8.-“The Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime\nand in the night his song shall be with me.”\n\nHere the Ellipsis is insufficiently supplied by the words, “shall be.”\nThe Ellipsis is complex, and to be understood thus:-The Lord will\ncommand his loving kindness [and his song with me] in the daytime,\nand in the night also [he will command his loving kindness and] his\nsong.\n\nIsa. 32:3.-“And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, [and they\nshall see]: and the ears of them that hear shall [not be dull, buf]\nhearken.”\n\nJoh. 5:21.-“For like as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth\nthem; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.”\n\nHere the Ellipsis is treated as being Simple, instead of Complex,\nand is supplied by the word “them.” But the words “raiseth up the\ndead” in the former clause are latent in the latter, while the words\n“whom he will” in the latter clause are latent in the former, thus:-\n“For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [whom he\nwill]; even so the Son [raiseth up the dead, and] quickeneth whom he\nwill].”\n\nOr according to the Greek, “So THE SON also.”\n\nJoh. 8:28.-“I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, |\nspeak these things;” i.e., “Of myself | do nothing [nor speak]; but |\nspeak these things as the Father hath taught me, [and / do them].”\n\nSee a similar illustration in verse 38.\n\nJoh. 14:10.-“The words that | speak unto you | speak not of myself:\nbut the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”\n\nThis complex Ellipsis must be understood as follows:-“The words\nwhich | speak unto you, | speak not of myself, [but the Father that\ndwelleth in me, he speaketh them]: and [the works which | do, | do not\nof myself], but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”\nJoh. 17:26.-“And | have declared unto them thy name, and will\ndeclare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them,\nand | in them,” i.e., “And | have declared to them thy name, and will\ndeclare [thy love]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be\nin them, and | [and my love] may be in them.”\nRom. 6:4.-“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death:\nthat like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the\nFather,” etc.\n\nThe complex Ellipsis here may be thus worked out: “Therefore we\nare buried with him by His baptism-unto-death [and raised again from\nthe dead], that like as Christ was [buried and] raised again from the\ndead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in\nnewness of life.” (See pages 18, 19, on the context of this passage).\nHeb. 12:20.-“And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be\nstoned, or thrust through with a dart.” In Exo. 19:13, the text is, “There\nshall not a hand touch it, for he shall surely be stoned or shot through\nwith a dart; whether it be man or beast, he shall not live.”\n\nHere the man was to be stoned and the beast shot. In the MSS.\nwords have been gratuitously inserted by transcribers to make sense,\nin ignorance of the complex Ellipsis. The sense is made clear thus:-\n\n“And if so much as [a man or] a beast touch the mountain-[if a man\ntouch] it, he shall be stoned [and if a beast touch it, it shall be] thrust\nthrough with a dart.”\nFalse Ellipsis\nThere are not only many instances where the Ellipses which exist in\nthe original have been incorrectly supplied in the translation: but there\nare cases also of italics being inserted, where there is really no Ellipsis\nin the original.\n\nIn these cases the italics have been necessitated by the faulty\ntranslation, and not by the Text.\n\nWe give a few examples, arising from various causes:\n\nGen. 37:12-13.-“And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in\nShechem. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the\nflock in Shechem?”\n\nThe Massorah gives the words rendered “their father’s flock” as\none of the fifteen dotted words,* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction,\npp. 320, 325. Also The Massorah, by the same author and publisher.]\ni.e., words which ought to be cancelled in reading, though they have\nnot been removed from the Text. If these words are removed, then the\ninference is that they had gone to feed themselves and make merry,\nand the words “the flock’ in verse 13 need not be inserted in italics.\nNum. 16:1.-The last word “men” is necessitated by having put the\nverb “took” out of its place. There is no Ellipsis. The verse reads that\n“Korah ... and Dathan and Abiram ... and On took the sons of\nReuben.” Or that Korah ... took Dathan ... and Abiram ... and On, the\nson of Peleth, the sont [Note: According to the Samaritan Pentateuch\nand the Septuagint Version and a few MSS.] of Reuben.\n\nDeu. 29:29.-“The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but\nthose things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for\never, that we may do all the words of this law.”\n\nThe italics thus supplied make excellent sense in English, but this\nis not the sense of the Hebrew.\n\nThe Massorah gives the words, “to the Lord our God,” as being\none of fifteen examples in which the words are dotted and which are\ntherefore to be cancelled in reading.t [Note: See Ginsburg’s\nIntroduction, pp. 370, 572.] If these words be removed the sense will\nbe, “The secret things and the revealed things are for us and for our\nchildren for ever, that we may do all the words of this law,” i.e., the\nsecret things which have not been, but will yet be revealed. Compare\nchap. 30:11-14.\n\nDeu. 32:34-35.-Here, in verse 35, the word “belongeth” is inserted in\nitalic type through reading the Hebrew Miu (lee) as being the\npreposition and pronoun “to me.” But the Й (yod) is really the\nabbreviation of the word Йен (убт) day, * [Note: See Ginsburg’s\nIntroduction, Part ., chap. м., pp. 165-170.] as is clear from the\nTargum of Onkelos, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Septuagint\ntranslation Taking, then, Min (lee) as being an abbreviation of ΜΜΘΗ\n(Гуот) for the day, the four lines form an alternate correspondence:\nthe first line reading on consecutively with the third, and the second\nwith the fourth, thus:-\n\nа — 15 not this laid up in store with me,\n\nЬ Sealed up in my treasuries\nа — For the day of vengeance and recompense,\nЬ — For the time when their foot shall slip?\n\nHere, b is in a parenthesis with respect to a and a, while a is ina\nparenthesis with respect to b and b; and the passage really reads thus\nas regards the actual sense; “Is not this laid up in store with me for the\nday of vengeance and recompense:\n\n“Sealed up in my treasuries for the time when their foot shall\nslide?”\n\nThe word ΜΜΘΗ (Губт), for the day, corresponds with МТЪ\n(Vath), for the time.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders the last two\nlines, “Vengeance is mine and recompense, at the time when their foot\nshall slide.”\nJos. 24:17.-“For the Lord our God, He it is that brought us up and our\nfathers out of the land of Egypt.” Here the two words “it is” are\nsupplied in italics, because it is not observed that there is an\nHomeeoteleuton§ [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, Part ΙΙ. chap. vi.\npp. 171-182.] (αν. [Note: Which see.] ) in the Hebrew Text; i.e., the\nScribe having written the word “He” omitted the next word “is God,” his\neye going back to a second “He” which follows it. This is clear from the\nfact that the words “is God” are preserved in the Septuagint\ntranslation.\n\nThe passage therefore reads, “For the Lord our God, He is God,\nHe brought us up, etc.,” thus emphasizing the pronoun “He” by\nRepetition (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).\n1Sa. 24:9-10.-“David said to Saul ... some bade me kill thee, but mine\neye spared thee.” The Hebrew Text as it now stands is CbbC\n(vattachas) but she spared thee. This yields no sense, so the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have followed the\nVulgate and inserted “mine eye” in italics. But Dr. Ginsburg points out*\n[Note: Introduction, pp. 291, 292.] that in all probability in the\ntranscription of the Text from the ancient Phoenician characters into\nthe square characters, (which is A) was mistaken for (which is b)\nand so b3C, she spared, was written instead of A3C, / spared. There\ncan be no question that this was the primitive reading as it is\npreserved in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\nChaldee, and Syriac.\n\n2Sa. 1:18.-“He bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the\nbow: behold, it is written in the book of dasher.”\n\nHere the words supplied are manifestly incorrect. It should be, “He\ncommanded them to teach the children of Judah ‘The Bow,’ or [this\nSong ой ‘The Bow,’ behold, it is written in the book of Jashar,” i.e., the\nupright, a book of national songs, probably, but of which nothing is\nknown. It is clear that this song of David\'s had not already been\nwritten in that book, but he gave directions that it should be there\nwritten. See also Jos. 10:13.\n2Sa. 1:21.-“For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the\nshield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.”\n\nThe italics are wrongly supplied through not knowing that Omi\n(b\'lee) not should be Omi Т [Note: This is the reading of the first\nEdition of the Hebrew Bible, Soncino, 1488; also of the Syriac and\nArabic Versions, and the Chaldee paraphrase. The mistake of a for &\ncould be easily made.\nSee Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 144.] (k’lee) weapons.\n\nWith this emendation the verse reads:-\n\n“For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away,\n\nThe shield of Saul, the weapons anointed with oil,”\n\nor, “The weapons of him anointed with oil.”\n1К!. 20:33.-“Now the men did diligently observe whether anything\nwould come from him, and did hastily catch it.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] is a loose paraphrase. The R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] indicates the difficulty. In the Eastern\nRecension the words are divided differently from the Textus\nReceptus,} [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 438.] and should\nbe rendered,\n\n“Now the men divined and hasted [i.e., by Hendiadys (q.v. [Note:\nWhich see] ) quickly divined (his drift)] and they pressed whether it\nwas from him, and they said, etc.”\n\nNeh. 4:12.-“They said unto us ten times, from all places whence ye\nshall return unto us, [they will be upon you],” margin, “that from all\nplaces ye must return to us.”\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] puts the margin of\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] in the Text, and the Text in the margin.\n\nIt appears that it is not a case in which the apodosis is to be\nsupplied, but it may be taken literally. “They said unto us ten times,\nFrom all places ye shall return unto us.”\n\nPsa. 1:4.-“The ungodly are not so.” Lit., “Not so the ungodly.”\n\nThe structure of the Psalm shows that\n\nVerse 1 corresponds with verse 5.\nVerse 2 corresponds with verse 4-.\nVerse 3 corresponds with verse -4.\nVerses 1-3 concerning the godly.\nVerses 4 and 5 the ungodly.\n\nThus:-\n\npresent.\n\nА 1-3. The godly\nВ 4, 5. The ungodly\nfuture.\nА 6-. The godly\nВ -6. The ungodly\nThe first two may be expanded thus:-\nThe godly.\nA a — 1. Their blessing (not standing with the ungodly now)\nTheir way.\nЬ — 2. Their character\nο 3. Comparison\nThe ungodly.\nTheir way.\nB Ь 4-. Their character\nο. -4. Comparison\n8 5. Their punishment (not standing with the godly in the\njudgment)\nTherefore verse 4 corresponds with verse 2; and verse 2 must be\nunderstood, if not supplied, thus:-“Not so the ungodly: their delight is\nnot in the law of the Lord, neither do they meditate in His law, etc.”\nFor the Ellipsis in verse 5 see page 82.\n\nPsa. 2:12.-“And ye perish from the way.” R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] “and ye perish in the way.”\n\nThere is no “in” or “from” in the Hebrew: it is literally, “and ye lose\nthe way.” To lose the way is a Hebrew idiom for perishing, or being\nlost. It ought either to be translated literally, “and ye lose the way,” or\nidiomatically, “and ye be lost,” or, “and ye perish.” Psa. 1:1-6 ends with\nthe perishing of “the way,” and Psa. 2:1-12 ends with the perishing of\nthose who refuse to walk in it, by submitting themselves to the Son.\n“Kiss,” Psa. 2:12, is the same as “be ruled by” in Gen. 41:40, margin.\nPsa. 10:3.-“For the wicked boasteth of his heart\'s desire, and blesseth\nthe covetous whom the Lord abhorreth.” Margin, “and the covetous\nblesseth himself, he abhorreth the Lord.”\n\nThe struggles of the Revisers to make sense of the present\nHebrew Text may be seen in their rendering:\n\n“For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and the covetous\nrenounceth, yea, contemneth the Lord.” Margin, “and blesseth the\ncovetous, but revileth the Lord.”\n\nThe simple fact is that this is one of the passages altered by the\nSopherim through a mistaken reverence, in order to avoid the uttering\nof the words involving a curse on Jehovah. But in this case, having\naltered “he blasphemeth” into “he blesseth,” the word “blesseth” they\ndid not remove it from the text. Hence both words now stand in the\nprinted text, which is as follows:\n\n“For the wicked boasteth of his heart\'s desire; and the robber\nblesseth, blasphemeth the Lord.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction,\nр. 365.]\n\nIf we simply remove the word “blesseth,” we have the primitive text\nwithout more ado, and have no need to supply any Ellipsis.\n\nPsa. 19:3.-“There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not\nheard.”\n\nHere the word “where” seems to be unnecessarily supplied. The\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] omits it. The sense appears\nto be, as expressed in the margin, “without these their voice is heard.”\nThat is to say, with regard to the heavens “[they have] no speech nor\nlanguage; their voice is not heard,” and yet they do utter speech, they\ndo declare knowledge; and their words go forth through all the earth.t\n[Note: See The Witness of the Stars (by the same author and\npublisher), pp. 4-6.]\nPsa. 27:13.-“/ had fainted unless | had believed to see the goodness\nof the Lord in the land of the living.”\n\nThe words, “/ had fainted,” both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] , are an arbitrary addition in order to\nmake sense.\n\nThe difficulty arises from disregarding the fact that the word\n“unless” is dotted in the printed text, and should be cancelled in\nreading. It is cancelled in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).] Syriac and Vulgate, and the clause should be rendered:\n\n“| believe that | shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of\nthe living.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 333.]\n\nPsa. 68:16.-“Why leap ye, ye high hills? This is the hill which God\ndesireth to dwell in.”\n\nHere, by taking ШЦГ (ratzad) as meaning to leap, the sense has\nbeen obscured, and then the attempt is made to clear it by the use of\nthe italics.\n\nШЦГ occurs only here, and is an Arabic word, which means to\nlook askance at, or to envy, and the verse reads naturally: “Why do ye\nenvy, О ye high hills, the hill God desired for His seat?” i.e., Sinai, see\nverse 17. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] agrees with\nthis.\n\nPsa. 69:4.-“They that would destroy me, being mine enemies\nwrongfully.”\n\nThe Syriac supplies a letter (T), thus giving the reading, “more\nthan my bones,” instead of “they that would destroy me being,” etc. So\nthat the verse reads:\n\n“They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my\nhead;\n\n“They that are mine enemies falsely are more than my bones.”\nPsa. 69:20 (21).-Ί looked for some to take pity, but there was none;\nand for comforters, but | found none.”\n\nTranslated more closely with the Chaldee, Septuagint, Syriac, and\nVulgate, we may dispense with the italics:-\n\n“| looked for a sympathizer, but there was none. And for\ncomforters, but | found none.”\nPsa. 75:5 (6).-“Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff\nneck.”\n\nHere, owing to the fact that quiescent letters are sometimes\ninserted and sometimes omitted in the Heb. text, the A (aleph) is\ninserted in the word Ouew (b\'tzur) rock, making it 6ueaw\n(b’tzavwvahr) neck. The LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.).] evidently read it as rock, without the aleph, and the passage\nought to read without the italics:-\n\n“Do not exalt your horn toward heaven, nor speak arrogantly of the\n\nRock.”\nPsa. 118:5.-“I called upon JAH in distress: Jehovah answered me,\nand set me in a large place.” According to the Western Recension of\nthe Heb. text (which the Textus Receptus follows) Goms6ng\n(Bammerchavyah) is one word, and means in a large place, and\nhence, with freedom or with deliverance (compare Hos. 4:16, Psa.\n31:8). But according to the Eastern Recension the reading is\npresented in two words 601136 WG; * [Note: See Ginsburg’s\nIntroduction, pp. 385, 386.] and the verse should be rendered:\n“I called upon JAH in my distress. He answered me with the\ndeliverance of JAH.”\n\nIt will be noted that both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ignore the Textus Receptus, and not only divide the\nword into two, but remove it from the end to the beginning of the line.\nConsequently they have to supply the sense with the italics, “and set\nme.”\n\nPsa. 126:3.-“Whereof we are glad.” Here the word “whereof’ is\nunnecessary.\n\nThe structure gives:-\n\nа 2-. Our gladness.\n\nЬ -2. The Lord’s great things.\nЬ — 3-. The Lord’s great things.\nа -3. Our gladness.\nOr fully thus:-\nа _2-. Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue\nwith singing.\nb -2. Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath\ndone great things for them.\nЬ — 3-. The Lord hath done great things for us:\n\nа — -3. Weare glad.\n\nIt will be seen how а answers to a, and b 10 b.\n\nPsa. 127:2.-‘It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the\nbread of sorrows; for so he giveth his beloved sleep.”\n\nHere the word “for’ is unnecessarily introduced, creating a\nconfusion of thought and hiding the meaning. Translated correctly, the\nsense is perfect without any human addition. The word “so,” is On\nthus, in this manner. № refers to what follows, viz., to the Lord’s way of\ngiving in contrast to man’s way of “works.” God\'s spiritual blessings\nare not obtained by incessant labour-rising early and sitting up late,\nnor by painful and sorrowful effort. “Thus He giveth”-this is the way He\ngiveth to His beloved-How? “sleeping” or while they sleep. uypa\n(sheynah) is an adverbial accusative, meaning “in sleep.”\nIt was in this way He gave His wondrous gifts to Solomon. His\nname was (ὔγήτήῃ) “Yedidiah,” i.e., beloved of Jehovah (238.\n12:25). The word here is also ЙГИГ Yedeed, i.e., beloved. And this\nPsalm relates to Solomon, as we learn from the Title. Solomon knew\nby a blessed experience how God gave to him His richest blessings\nwhile he was “sleeping” (1Ki. 3:3-15). Even so He gave to Adam a\nBride (Gen. 2:21-22); to Abram, the everlasting Covenant (Gen.\n15:12-16), and to Jedidiah “His beloved,” wisdom, riches and honour.\n“Thus He giveth to His beloved while they sleep” when they are\nhelpless and are unable to put forth any effort of works, by which to\nearn the blessing, and in which the flesh might glory before God.\n(1Со. 1:29.)\n\nHow wondrously He gives! E’en while we sleep-\n\nWhen we from all our “works” have ceased, and rest;\n\nAnd He our life doth mercifully keep,\n\nThen, without works, are His beloved blest.* [Note: Rom. 11:6.]\n\nYes! “His beloved”! lovéd not because\nOf any work which we have ever done;t [Note: Tit. 3:5.]\n\nBut loved in perfect grace, “without a cause”:¢ [Note: Rom. 3:24.\n“Being justified freely by His grace.” The word “freely” here is\nthe same word (222223) dérean as in Joh. 15:25, where it is\nrendered “without a cause.” (“They hated me without a\ncause”). There was absolutely no cause why our blessed Lord\nJesus was “hated.” Even so it is with regard to our\njustification:-“Being justified without a cause by His grace.”]\nThis is the source whence all our blessings come.\n\nHe gives in sleep! In vain we toil and strive-\n\nAnd rise up early and so late take rest:\nBut, while our powers in sweetest sleep revive,\nAnd we abandon all our anxious quest-\n\nThen He bestows His gifts of grace on us,\n\nAnd where we\'ve never sown, He makes us reap\n\nA harvest, full of richest blessing. “Thus\nHe gives to His belovéd while they sleep.”\nSong Son. 8:6.-“For love is strong as death: jealousy is cruel as the\ngrave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement\nflame.” This last sentence is the rendering of one word in the Textus\nReceptus μιμμσρήῃ (Shalhebethyah), but, according to the\nEastern Recension, and several early editions, it is divided into two\nwords, “the flames of Jah.” Hence the sense is:\n“Love is strong as death.\nAffection is inexorable as Hades.\nIts flames are flames of fire.\nThe flames of Jah.”§ [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p.\n386]\nThe second and fourth lines are the intensification of the first and\nthird.\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders the last line,\n\n“A very flame of the Lord.”\nEze. 22:20.-“As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and\ntin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it: so\nwill | gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and | will leave you\nthere and melt you.”\n\nIt will be noticed that this last sentence is a non sequitur, both as\nto rhythm and parallelism. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] is no clearer: “And | will lay you there.”\n\nThe fact is that the letter Ф (Pe) т едфзЗЪЙ (v’hippachtee), in\nthe ancient and primitive text was mistaken for ) (nun), (owing to the\nsimilarity of the Phoenician characters, when transcribed into the more\nmodern square characters); and thus / will blow became / will leave,\nand then the two words, “you there,” had to be supplied in order to\nmake sense.* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 294.] The\nparallelism is thus beautifully perfect:\n\nа — As they gather ...\n\nЬ toblow...\ncto melt it:\nа Sowwilll gather ...\nЬ — апа | will blow\nс — апа melt you.\n\nIt will be seen how the words, “I will leave,” mar this structure.\n\nHos. 4:7.-“As they were increased, so they sinned against me:\ntherefore will | change their glory into shame.”\n\nThe word “therefore” is inserted by the translators; who did not\nknow that this is one of the eighteen emendations of the Sopherimt\n[Note: See Appendix E: and Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 357.] by\nwhich the primitive text, “my glory,” by the change of one letter (ἄ for\nH) became “their glory,” and the first person became the third. The\noriginal text stood:-\n\n“As they increased, so they sinned against me:\nThey have changed my glory into shame;\nThey eat up,” etc.\n\nA like alteration was made in Jer. 2:11, and very anciently; for it is\nfollowed by the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ,\nthe ancient versions, and A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] It should be “my glory,” not “their glory.”\n\nJon. 3:9.-“Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from\nhis fierce anger, that we perish not?”\n\nHere it is not necessary to put the word “if’ in italics. The Hebrew\nidiom, in the formula or expression OM OWETT (mee yodeah) means\nwho knoweth? in the sense of no one knows whether, or no one\nknows but that (see Psa. 90:11. Ecc. 2:19; Ecc. 3:21; Ecc. 6:12; Ecc.\n8:1. Joe. 2:14). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\ntranslates Jon. 3:9 as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders Ecc. 2:19, “who\nknoweth whether” (without italics).\n\nRalph Venning* [Note: Orthodox Paradoxes, 1650-1660 a.d.]\n\nbeautifully expresses the theology of this and similar passagest\n[Note: Such as 2Ch. 34:19-21. Isa. 39:5; Isa. 39:8.] in the following\nlines:-\n\n“But stay! Is God like one of us? Can He,\n\nWhen He hath said it, alter His decree?\n\nDenouncéd judgment God doth oft prevent,\nBut neither changeth counsel nor intent;\n\nThe voice of heaven doth seldom threat perdition,\n\nBut with express or an implied condition:\n\nSo that, if Nineveh return from ill,\n\nGod turns His hand: He doth not turn His will.”\nMal. 3:9.-“Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even\nthis whole nation.” This must be added to the eighteen emendations of\nthe Sopherim.¢ [Note: See Appendix E: and Ginsburg’s Introduction,\np. 3631]\n\nThe primitive text was, “Ye have cursed me with a curse.” The\nactive was changed into the passive by putting [ for О.\nMat. 20:23.-“To sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to\ngive, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my\nFather.”\n\nThis supply of the Ellipsis has caused much confusion. The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] also unnecessarily inserts “but it\nis for them for whom it is prepared of my Father.”\n\nThe passage reads:-“To sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not\nmine to give but [it is already given] to them for whom it is prepared of\nmy Father.”\n\nMar. 11:13.-“And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if\nhaply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he\nfound nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.”\n\nHere, want of accuracy in the translation has created a difficulty,\nand the word “yet’ has been added, in order to meet it. Want of\nattention to the full meaning of the Greek has led to alterations of the\nText itself by various copyists: for man is always ready to assume\nanything to be at fault, except his own understanding.\n\nThe last clause, by the figure of Hyperbaton (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee.] ), is put out of its grammatical order; for the purpose of calling\nattention to it, and to complete the structure (see below). Naturally, it\nwould follow the word “thereon.” The word “for” introduces the\nexplanation of “if haply.” It does not give the reason why He found\nnothing, but the reason why it was doubtful.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates literally,\n“for it was not-the season of figs:” but still leaves the difficulty of Jesus\ngoing to find figs when it was not the fig-season.\n\nThere are two or three points to be noted:\n\nThe word καιρός (kairos) means not “time,” which is χρόνος\n(chronos), but a limited portion of time, and always with the idea of\nSuitability; hence, the right time, proper season, stated season, when\nthe thing referred to comes to a head, or crisis. Hence, applied to a\ntree, it denotes the ordinary and regular fruit-season of that\ntree.* [Note: It is interesting to note that in modern Greek, the word\n22222? (kairos), season, has come to mean “weather”; while 222222\n(chronos) time, is now used not merely of time, but “year.”] The\nPassover did not occur at the proper fig-season; but figs remained on\nthe trees (dried) right through the winter. These, which could generally\nbe found, were called cbB (pag). The name is preserved in the word\nBethphage (βηθφαγή, for 6”bOchaBi, house of figs). At the time\nof the Passover, such figs might well have been looked for.\nThe Lord went to see “if consequently (ei Gea) he might find\nanything thereon.” It was “if consequently,” because “it was not the\nproper season of figs” (oUka, suka: not ὄλυνθοι, olunthoi, as the others\nwere called, and for which He sought).\n\nWe must also remember that in the East all fruit trees were\nenclosed in gardens, and had an owner. This tree, though, by the\nroadside (Mat. 21:19) must have been enclosed, and as it grew over\nthe wall, passers by might partake of the fruit. But the owner had\nprobably shaken the fruit off, or gathered it himself, and hence\ndeserved the judgment which came upon him (see Lev. 19:9-10; Lev.\n23:22. Deu. 24:19-21). This is one of the two miracles of destruction\nwrought by Jesus: and we know that in the other case the owners of\nthe swine were justly punished.\nThe miracle has its prophetic teaching for us. In the preceding\nverse we read how Jesus went into the temple, and “looked round\nabout upon all things,” and went out to Bethany. In the morning He\ndestroyed this tree on His way to the cleansing of the Temple; after\nwhich (verse 17) He taught them, saying, “Is it not written, My house\nshall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made\nit a den of robbers” (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ). The\nfruit of such a tree was for all who passed by (Deu. 23:24): but it did\nnot answer its end, and it was destroyed. In like manner that House,\nwhich through the greed of man had failed to fulfil its purpose, Would\nbe destroyed as that fig-tree had been.\n\nThe verse then reads thus: “And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having\nleaves, he went if consequently anything [/.e., any ὄλυνθοι (olunthoi),\ndried figs] he should find on it: for it was not the time of figs (σῦκα,\nsuka): and oncoming up to it, nothing found he save leaves.” The\nexplanatory clause (though it belongs to the former clause, as here\nrendered) is put last to complete the structure which is as follows:-\n\nStructure of the passage (Mar. 11:13).\n\nΑ And seeing a fig-tree afar off\n\nВ shaving leaves,\nС а hecame,\nЬ _ if haply he might find anything thereon:\nС а andwhen he came to it,\nЬ — пе found nothing\nВ but leaves only,\nA {οι it was not the proper season of figs.\nThe subjects correspond thus:-\nΑ Fig-tree.\nB Leaves.\nС а _ Coming.\nЬ Finding.\nС а Coming.\nЬ Finding.\nВ Leaves.\nА Figs.\nJoh. 8:6.-Неге the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] has given an addition which pertains\nrather to the expositor than to the Translator:\n“But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground\nas though he heard them not.”\nIt is impossible to know all the motives of the Lord Jesus in this\nact; but, judging from Eastern habits of to-day, there was a silent\ncontempt and an impressive rebuke implied in this inattention to their\ninsincere charge.\n\nRom. 1:7 and 1Co. 1:2 -“Called to be saints,”.\nRom. 1:1, and 1Co. 1:1.-“Called {ο be an apostle.”\n\nIt is a question whether there is any ellipsis here, or whether it is\ncorrectly supplied. The Greek is κλητοῖς ἁγίοις (kleetois hagiois). But\nwe have these same words in the Septuagint translation of Lev. 23:2,\nwhich throws light upon the expression. “Speak unto the children of\nIsrael, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which ye\nshall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.” The\nΙΧΧ. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] translates the\nwords “holy convocations,” κλητὰς ἁγίας (kleetas hagias), i.e.,\nassemblies by special calling as holy to the Lord. Hence, in the New\nTestament expressions the meaning is the same, i.e., saints by the\ncalling of God, or by Divine calling: viz., those who have been Divinely\nselected and appointed as saints. So also of an apostle it denotes one\nwho has by a special calling of God been made an apostle. In other\nwords, “by Divine calling, saints;” or “by Divine calling, an apostle.”\nRom. 12:3.-“For | say, through the grace given unto me, to every man\nthat is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to\nthink.”\nIt is a question here, whether the thinking ought to be limited by\nthe insertion of the words “of himself,” as there is no limitation in the\nGreek. The verb ὑπερφρονέω (hyperphroneé) occurs only in this\npassage, and it means {ο think more than one ought, not merely of\none’s self, but of anything. It denotes especially a highmindedness\nabout any subject, which makes one proud, arrogant, boastful or\ninsolent. Indeed, there is in this verse another figure, or peculiar form\nof words, called Paregmenon (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] ), where several\nwords of a common origin are used in the same sentence. This figure\nis used for the purpose of calling our attention to the statement so as\nto emphasize it. The words can be only inadequately expressed in\ntranslation: “For | say, through the grace given unto me, to every man\nthat is among you, not to THINK-more-highly (ὑπερφονεῖν\nhyperphronein) than he ought to THINK (φρονεῖν phronein), but to\nTHINK (φρονεῖν, phronein) so as to THINK-soberly (σωφρονεῖν\nsdéphronein), according as to each one [of you] God hath distributed\n[his] measure of faith.”\n\nThe verses which follow show that God has dealt out spiritual gifts\nin different measures (verse 6), and that he who has a larger measure\nthan another is not on that account to be proud, or to think on any\nsubject beyond his own measure of faith.\n2Co. 6:1.-“We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also,\n&с.”\n\nThe insertion of the words, “with him,” here, and in the R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] also, gives a totally false view of our\nposition as workers. The sense is quite complete without any addition\nwhatever. We are not fellow-workers with God, but with our brethren;\nwith you, not with him, should be the words supplied, if any. The verse\nreads: “But working together (or as fellow-workers with you), we\nexhort also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”\n\nGal. 3:24.-“The law was our schoolmaster {ο bring us unto Christ.”\n\nHere there is no need to introduce the words, “to bring us,” the\nsense being complete without them: εἰς (e/s), unto, is used in its well-\nknown sense of up fo, or until. See Php. 1:10, “That ye may be sincere\nand without offence till the day of Christ.” Eph. 1:14, “Which is the\nearnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased\npossession.”\n\nThat is to say, until Christ came and brought justification by free,\npure, and true grace, the Law, like a tutor, kept them under restraint;\nand is here in entire contrast to that liberty wherewith Christ hath\nmade His people free (see chap. 5:1, and Joh. 8:36. Rom. 8:2).\n\nGal. 3:20.-“Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.”\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nboth repeat the noun mediator, which only introduces confusion. The\nsense is clear without it.\n\n“Now a mediator is not of one [party]:” i.e., there must be two\nparties where there is a mediator; for he is a person who stands\nbetween the two others. Now when God gave the promise to Abram\n(Gen. 15:9-21), there was only one party; for God caused Abram to\nfall into a deep sleep, and He Himself “was one”-the One who, alone,\nwas thus the one party to this glorious covenant; which is therefore\nunconditional, and must stand for ever.\n\nHeb. 2:16.-“For verily he took not on him the nature of angels.”\n\nThe Greek is, “For verily he taketh not hold of angels, but of the\nseed of Abraham he taketh hold,” i.e., to redeem them, hence he had\nto partake of the nature of Abraham’s seed; but this is in verse 17, not\n16.\nHeb. 4:15.-“But was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without\nsin,” i.e., “but was tried according to all things, according to our\nlikeness, apart from sin.”\n\nHeb. 12:2.-“Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.”\nThere is no Ellipsis here, but both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] have supplied the word “our,” which\nintroduces quite a different thought into the passage.\n\nIt is evident that it is not our faith, but faith itself.\n\nIn the preceding chapter we have many examples of faith. Each\none exhibits some particular aspect of faith in its perfection. For\nexample; in Abel, we have the most perfect example of faith in\nconnection with worship: in Enoch the most perfect example of faith’s\nwalk: while in Noah, we have the most perfect example of faith’s\nwitness, and so on through the chapter; the historical order\ncorresponding with the theological and experimental order. Each is\nlike a portrait in which some particular feature is perfect: while the\nchapter concludes with two groups of portraits; the one illustrating\nfaith’s power to conquer (verses 32-35), and the other illustrating\nfaith’s power to suffer (verses 36-38). Then chap. xii. continues,\n“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a\ncloud of witnesses* [Note: |.e., those who gave testimony or evidence\nby their words, their life or death. There is no idea of eye-witnesses in\nthis word, as though they were beholding or looking upon us. The\nwitnesses referred to are the examples of faith cited in chap. 11.] let\nus lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,\nand let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking ({6.,\nἀφορῶντες, aphoréntes, looking away from) unto.”\n\nUnlike these examples, which each had only one aspect of faith in\nperfection, Jesus had every aspect perfect. His was a portrait in which\nevery feature was perfect, for He is the Beginner and Ender of faith.\nHe leads the van and brings up the rear; He is the Sum and the\nSubstance of faith. It is not “οι” faith of which Jesus is here the\nAuthor and Finisher, but faith itself. The Greek goes on to say, “looking\noff unto the author and finisher of faith-Jesus.”\n\nLooking off from all these human examples, each of which after all\nexhibited only one feature of faith, unto Him who is the perfect Princet\n[Note: The word translated “author” is a?????? (archeegos) really an\nadjective, leading, furnishing the first cause; then it means a leader,\nbut it is more a chief leader; hence it is sometimes rendered Prince.\nOriginator, beginner, and author are all parts of its meaning. It occurs\nonly in Act. 3:15, “killed the Prince of life,” i.e., the author and giver of\nlife; Act. 5:31, “exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour’; Heb. 2:10, “to\nmake the Captain of their salvation perfect,” i.e. the author of their\nsalvation. Hence, princely-leader is a meaning which embraces all the\nothers.] and Leader of all faithful ones and the Author of faith itself-\neven Jesus, “who for the joy that was set before him endured the\ncross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the\nthrone of God.”\n\n1Jn. 3:16.-“Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid\ndown his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the\nbrethren.”\nThis passage read without the italics is perfectly clear and\nbeautiful:-“Hereby perceive we love,” i.e., what love really is! or\n“Hereby have we got to know love” (perfect tense). For it was never\nknown what love was, until HE-Jesus-laid down His life for us. The\nonly Ellipsis here is in the definition of the subject “he.” It is ἐκεῖνος\n(ekeinos), that one, that blessed One, the Lord Jesus. All the more\nemphatic from its being presupposed that He is so wonderful that\nthere can be no possible doubt as to His identity. Just as in 2Ti. 1:12 :\n“For | know whom (he does not say, in whom) | have believed, and |\nam persuaded that he is able to keep that (he does not say what)\nwhich He has committed unto me against that day” (R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] margin), (he does not say what day)! That\nwhich God had committed unto Paul was “that goodly deposit”-the\nrevelation of the mystery concerning the Body of Christ. The word\nπαραθήκη (paratheeke) occurs only here (verse 14) and 1Ti. 6:20\n(according to the best texts). It was committed to Timothy also, and he\nwas to guard it by the Holy Spirit dwelling within him. And though all\nmight turn away from him and his teaching concerning it (verse 15),\nyet God would guard it and care for it, and preserve it against that day.\n2Pe. 1:20-21.-“Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is\nof any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time\n(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , at any time) by the will of man: but holy\nmen of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”\n\nHere, there is no Ellipsis. The words “as they were moved” merely\nrepresent the participle “being moved,” as in the R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.]\n\nThe confessed difficulty of this passage arises partly from the\npeculiar words employed. (1) The noun translated “interpretation”\n(ἐπήλυσις, epilusis) occurs nowhere else in the whole Bible, and only\nonce or twice in secular Greek writings. Even the verb (ἐπιλύω, epilud)\noccurs only twice, viz., Mar. 4:34, “He expounded all things to his\ndisciples,” and Act. 19:39, “It shall be determined in a lawful\nassembly,” {Θ., made known in such an assembly. The verb means to\nuntie, unloose, and hence to unfold or disclose. This is its meaning in\nthe only place where it occurs in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint\nVersion (325 b.c.).] , Gen. 41:12, of Joseph interpreting the dreams of\nPharaoh\'s servants. Here it is used as the translation of the Heb.\nΦμμι (pathar), to open, unfold, or disclose. Hence, the noun can\nmean only an unfolding, or disclosure: just as when one Unties a\nparcel or bundle, and discloses what is contained within it.\n\n(2) The word “private” is the translation of the word ἴδιος (idios),\nwhich occurs 113 times. It is never translated “private,” except here.\nSeventy-seven times it is rendered “his own” (e.g., “his own servants,”\nMat. 25:14; “his own country,” Joh. 4:44; “his own name,” Joh. 5:43;\n“his own sheep,” Joh. 10:3-4, etc.).\n\nThen the verb “is” is not the equivalent for the verb “to be,” but it is\nquite a different ναΓρ-(γίνοµαι, ginomai), which means to begin to be,\ncome into existence, to originate, arise, become, come to pass, etc.\n\nNow, putting these facts together and observing the order of the\nwords in the original, we read the passage thus:-\n\n“Knowing this first, that all prophecy of Scripture came (or\noriginated) not of his or its own [i.e., the prophet’s own] unfolding (or\nSending forth); for not by the will of man was prophecy at any time\nbrought in, but borne along by the Holy Spirit spake the holy men of\nGod.”\nOr keeping to the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] as far as possible:-“Knowing this first,\nthat no prophecy of the Scripture came of [the prophet’s, or of its own]\nunfolding; for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but the\nholy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”\n\nOr taking the last clause as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , “But holy men spake from God, [not from\nthemselves], moved by the Holy Ghost.”\n\nThe whole scope of this passage is, not the interpretation of\nScripture, but its origin: it does not speak of what the Scripture means,\nbut of whence it comes.',''),(2,2,'zeugma','1. Protozeugma: or, Ante-Yoke\n\nPro’-to-zeug’-ma, from πρώτον (pré™-ton), the first, or the beginning,\nand Zeugma: meaning yoked at the beginning; because the verb,\nwhich is thus unequally yoked, is placed at the beginning of the\nsentence. Hence, it was called also ANTEZEUGMENON, i.e., yoked\nbefore (from the Latin, ante, before), or ante-yoked. Another name\nwas PROEPIZEUXIS (prod-ep-i-zeux’-is), yoked upon before (from\nπτρό (pro), before, and ἐπί (epi), upon).\n\nThe Latins called it INJUNCTUM, i.e., joined, or yoked to, from in,\nand jugum, a yoke (from jungo, to join).\n\nGen. 4:20.-“And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell\nin tents and cattle.”\n\nHere the verb “dwell” is placed before “tents” and “cattle,” with both\nof which it is yoked, though it is accurately appropriate only to “tents,”\nand not to “cattle.” The verb “possess” would be more suitable for\ncattle. And this is why the figure is a kind of Ellipsis, for the verse if\ncompleted would read, “he was the father of such as dwell in tents[and\npossess] cattle.” But how stilted and tame compared with the figure\nwhich bids us throw the emphasis on the fact that he was a nomade\n(vO, 8 wanderer or nomade), and cared more for wandering about\nthan for the shepherd part of his life!\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] has supplied the verb in italics:-“[such as have]\ncattle,” as though it were a case of ordinary Ellipsis. The R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] supplies the second verb “have.”\nIt may be, however, that the sense is better completed by taking\nthe words η η ОЧрд (vahaley michneh), tents of cattle, as in\n2Ch. 14:14, /е., cattle-tents, i.e., herdsmen. Or, as in Gen. 46:32;\nGen. 46:34, by supplying the Ellipsis:-“Such as dwell in tents and [men\nой cattle,” {.6., herdsmen. So that the sense would be much the same.\nExo. 3:16.-“I have surely visited you, and that which is done to you in\nEgypt.” We are thus reminded that it was not merely that Jehovah had\nseen that which they had suffered, but rather had visited because of\nHis covenant with their fathers.\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nboth supply the second verb: “[seen] that which is done to you, etc.”\n\nIt may be that the verb cour (pachad), though used only once,\nshould be repeated (by implication) in another sense, which it has,\nviz.: “| have surely visited (i.e., looked after or cared for) you, and\n[visited] (i.e., punished for) that which is done to you in Egypt).” The\ntwo senses being to go {ο with the view of helping; and to go for or\nagainst with the view of punishing, which would be the figure of\nSyllepsis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\nDeu. 4:12.-“And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:\nye heard the voice of words, but saw no similitude, only a voice.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supply the\nsecond verb “[heard] only a voice.” The figure shows us that all the\nemphasis is to be placed on the fact that no similitude was seen; thus\nidolatry was specially condemned.\n\nThe word “idol” means, literally, something that is seen, and thus\nall worship that involves the use of sight, and indeed, of any of the\nsenses (hence called sensuous worship), rather than the heart,\npartakes of the nature of idolatry, and is abomination in the sight of\nGod.\n2Ki. 11:12.-“And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown\nupon him, and the testimony.” (2Ch. 23:11).\n\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nsupply the second verb, “gave him the testimony.” If it were a simple\nEllipsis, we might instead supply in his hand after the word\n“testimony.” But it is rather the figure of Zeugma, by which our\nattention is called to the importance of the “testimony” under such\ncircumstances (see Deu. 17:19) rather than to the mere act of the\ngiving it.\n\nIsa. 2:3.-“Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to\nthe house of the God of Jacob,” i.e., [and let us enter into] the house\nof the God of Jacob.\n\nLuk. 24:27.-“And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he\nexpounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning\nhimself.”\n\nHere the verb “beginning” suits, of course, only “Moses”; and some\nsuch verb as going through would be more appropriate; as he could\nnot begin at all the “prophets.”\n\nThis figure tells us that it is not the act which we are to think of, but\nthe books and the Scripture that we are to emphasize as being the\nsubject of the Risen Lord’s exposition.\n1Co. 3:2.-“l have fed you with milk, and not with meat.”\nHere the verb is ποτζω, to give drink, and it suits the subject,\n“milk,” but not “meat.” Hence the emphasis is not so much on the\nfeeding as on the food, and on the contrast between the “milk” and the\n“meat.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] avoids the figure by giving the verb a neutral\nmeaning. See how tame the passage would have been had it read: “I\nhave given you milk to drink and not meat to eat”! All the fire and force\nand emphasis would have been lost, and we might have mistakenly\nput the emphasis on the verbs instead of on the subjects: while the\nfigure would have been a Pleonasm (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) instead\nof a Zeugma.\n1Со. 7:10.- “And unto the married | command, yet not I, but the Lord.”\n\nHere the one verb is connected with the two objects: but we are,\nby this figure, shown that it is connected affirmatively with the Lord,\nand only negatively with the apostle.\n1Co. 14:34.- ο: it is not permitted them to speak; but to be under\nauthority.”\n\nThis has been treated as a simple Ellipsis: but the unequal yoke\n(Zeugma) is seen, the one verb being used for the two opposite\nthings; thus emphasizing the fact that it is not so much the permitting,\nor the commanding, which is important, but the act of speaking, and\nthe condition of being under authority.\n1Ti. 4:3.-“Forbidding to marry and to abstain from meats.”\n\nThis has been classed already under Ellipsis; but the Zeugma is\nalso seen; emphasizing the fact that it is celibacy and abstinence\nwhich are to be noted as the marks of the latter times rather than the\nmere acts of “forbidding” or commanding. The latter verb, which is\nomitted, is supplied by Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which see] ),\n“forbidding (κωλυόντων, kéluontén), to marry, and [commanding\n(κελευόντων, keleuontén)], etc.”\n\n2. Mesozeugma; or, Middle-Yoke\nMes’-o-zeug-ma, i.e., middle-yoke, from µέσος (mesos), middle. The\nZeugma is so-called when the verb or adjective occurs in the middle of\nthe sentence.\n\nThe Latins called it CONJUNCTUM, joined-together-with.\n\nMar. 13:26.-“Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds\nwith great power and glory.”\n\nHere in the Greek the adjective is put between the two nouns,\nthus: “Power, great, and glory,” and it applies to both in a peculiar\nmanner. This Zeugma calls our attention to the fact that the power will\nbe great and the glory will be great: and this more effectually\nemphasizes the greatness of both, than if it had been stated in so\nmany words.\n\nSo also 5:40, “The father of the child and the mother”; (verse 42)\n“Arose the damsel and walked.”\n\nLuk. 1:64.-“And his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue,\nand he spake and praised God.”\n\nHere it is not the act of the opening and loosing that we are to\nthink of, but the fact that through this predicted miracle he praised God\nwith his mouth and his tongue in spite of all the months of his enforced\nsilence.\n\n3. Hypozeugma; or, End-Yoke\nHy’-po-zeug ‘ma, i.e., end-yoke, from Отто (hupo or hypo), underneath.\nHence ὑποζεύγνυμι (hypozeugnumi), to yoke under. The figure of\nZeugma is so called when the verb is at the end of the sentence, and\nso underneath, the two objects.\nAct. 4:27-28.-“They were gathered together, to do whatsoever thy\nhand and thy counsel determined before to be done.”\nHere the verb “determined” relates only to “counsel” and not to\n“hand”: and shows us that we are to place the emphasis on the fact\nthat, though the power of God’s hand was felt sooner than His counsel\n(as Bengel puts it), yet even this was only in consequence of His own\ndeterminate counsel and foreknowledge. Compare chap. 2:23, and\n3:18.\n\n4. Synezeugmenon; or, Joint-Yoke\nSyn’-e-zeug’-men-on, i.e., yoked together with, or yoked connectedly,\nfrom σύν (sun or syn), together with, and ζεύγνυμµι, to yoke.\n\nThis name is given to the Zeugma when the verb is joined to more\nthan two clauses, each of which would require its own proper verb in\norder to complete the sense.* [Note: On the other hand, when in a\nsuccession of clauses each subject has its own proper verb,\nexpressed instead of being understood, then it is called HYPOZEUXIS\n(Hy’-po-zeux’-is), i.e., sub-connection with. See Psa. 145:5-7. 1Co.\n13:8. Where several members, which at first form one sentence, are\nunyoked and separated into two or more clauses, the figure is called\nDIEZEUGMENON, Di’-e-zeug’-men-on, i.e., yoked-through, from 222\n(dia), through. This was called by the Latins DISJUNCTIO. See under\nProsapodosis.] By the Latins it was called ADJUNCTUM, i.e., joined\ntogether.\nExo. 20:18.-“And all the people saw the thunderings, and the\nlightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.”\nHow tame this would be if the proper verbs had been expressed in\neach case! The verb “saw” is appropriate to the “lightnings” and\n“mountain.” And by the omission of the second verb “heard” we are\ninformed that the people were impressed by what they saw, rather\nthan by what they heard.\nPsa. 15:1-5 -Here the whole of the objects in verses 2-5 are\nconnected with one verb which occurs in the last verse (repeated from\nfirst verse). All the sentences in verses 2-5 are incomplete. There is\nthe Ellipsis of the verb, e.g., verse 2: “He that walketh uprightly [shall\nabide in thy tabernacle and shall never be moved], he that worketh\nrighteousness [shall never be moved],” etc.\nThis gives rise to, or is the consequence of the structure of the\nPsalm:-\nΑ 1. Who shall abide? (stability).\nqualities.\nВ а 2. Positive\nЬ 3. Negative\nВ а 4-Positive\nЬ — -4-5- Negative\nΑ -5. Who shall abide? (stability).\n\nEph. 4:31.-“Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and\nevil speaking, be put away from you.”\n\nHere the one verb “put away,” αἴρω (air6), is used of all these\nvarious subjects, though it does not apply equally to each: e.g.,\n“bitterness,” πικρία (pikria), the opposite of “kindness,” verse 32;\n“wrath,” θυμός (thumos), harshness, the opposite of “tender-hearted,”\nverse 32; “anger,” ὀργή (orgee), the opposite of “forgiving,” verse 32;\n“clamour,” κραυγή (kraugee), “evil-speaking,” βλασφημία\n(blasphemia), “malice,” κακία (kakia), wickedness.\n\nIt is the thing we are not to be, that is important, rather than the act\nof giving it up. (See the same passage under Polysyndeton).\n\nPhp. 3:10.-“That | may know him, and the power of his resurrection,\nand the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his\ndeath.”\nHere the one verb “know” properly refers to “Him.” The verbs\nsuited to the other subjects are not expressed, in order that we may\nnot be diverted by other action from the one great fact of our\nknowledge of Him. “That | may know Him (is the one great object, but\nto know Him | must experience) the power of His resurrection, and (to\nfeel this | must first share) the fellowship of His sufferings (How? by)\nbeing made like Him in His death,” i.e., by reckoning myself as having\ndied with Christ (Rom. 6:11), and been planted together in the likeness\nof His death (verse 5). So only can | know the power of that new\nresurrection life which | have as “risen with Christ,” enabling me to\n“walk in newness of life,” and thus to “know Him.”\n\nThe order of thought is introverted in verses 10 and 11.\n\nResurrection.\nSuffering.\nDeath.\n\nResurrection.\n\nAnd resurrection, though mentioned first, cannot be known until\nfellowship with His sufferings and conformity to His death have been\nexperienced by faith. Then the power of His resurrection which it\nexercises on the new life can be known; and we can know Him only in\nwhat God has made Christ to be to His people, and what He has\nmade His people to be in Christ.',''),(3,3,'asyndeton','For the sake of more easy reference, the following examples have\nnot been thus classified, but are given in the order in which they occur\nin the Bible:\n\nExo. 15:9-10.-“The enemy said,\n\n-| will pursue,\n\n-| will overtake,\n\n-| will divide the spoil;\n\n-My lust shall be satisfied upon them;\n\n-| will draw my sword,\n\n-My hand shall destroy them.\n\n-Thou didst blow with thy wind,\n\n-The sea covered them:\n\nThey sank as lead in the mighty waters.”\n\nHere we are hurried over what “the enemy said,” because it was\nnot of the least importance what he said or what he did. The great fact\nis recorded in the climax: on which all the emphasis is to be placed\nboth in thought and in public reading.\n\nJdg. 5:27.-“At her feet he bowed,\n-he fell,\n\n-he lay down;\n\n-at her feet he bowed,\n\n-he fell:\n\n-where he bowed,\n\nthere he fell down dead.”\n1Sa. 15:6.-“And Saul said unto the Kenites,\n-Go,\n-depart,\n-get you down from among the Amalekites,\n-lest | destroy you with them.”\nIsa. 33:7-12.-Here the figure is used to hasten us on through the\ndetails which describe the judgment on Assyria, in order that we may\ndwell on the important fact that the hour of Judah’s deliverance has\ncome:-\n“Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without;\n-the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly:\n-the highways lie waste,\n-the wayfaring man ceaseth:\n-he hath broken the covenant,\n-he hath despised the cities,\n-he regardeth no man:\n-the earth mourneth (the “and” here (in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) is incorrectly\ninserted),\n-languisheth:\n-Lebanon is ashamed,\n-hewn down (here again the “and” is introduced and mars the figure).\n-Sharon is like a wilderness;\n-And Bashan and Carmel shake [their leaves] (or, are all astir).\n“Now will | arise, saith the Lord:\n-now will | be exalted;\n-now will | lift up myself.\n“Ye shall conceive chaff (Ημ, dried grass, or tinder).\n-Ye shall bring forth stubble;\n-your breath as fire shall devour you.\n-And the people shall be as the burnings of lime;\n-As thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.”\nEze. 33:15-16.-“If the wicked restore the pledge,\n-give again that he had robbed,\n-walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity;\n-he shall surely live\n-he shall not die.”* [Note: Here, in the climax, we have the figure of\nPleonasm (q.v.).]\n-“None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto\nhim:\n-he hath done that which is lawful and right;\n-he shall surely live.”\nMar. 2:27-28.-In the Textus Receptus the “and” is omitted, but it is\ninserted both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] with T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his critical Greek Text.] Tr.\n[Note: r. Tregelles and his critical Greek Text.] A. [Note: . Alford and\nhis critical Greek Text.] , WH. [Note: H. Westcott and Hort, and their\ncritical Greek Text.]\n\nIt reads, in spite of this, as though the “and” were an addition to\nthe text. Without it there is an Asyndeton, and a forcible conclusion\nflowing from it.\n\n“The Sabbath was made for man,\n\n-not man for the Sabbath;\n\ntherefore the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath also.” [Note: A.V.,\nwrongly, “Lord also.” R.V., “even of the Sabbath.” See “Also,” a Bible\nStudy on the Use of the Word by the same author and publisher.]\n\nMar. 7:21-23.-“For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed\n\nevil thoughts,\n\n-adulteries,\n\n-fornications,\n\n-murders,\n\n-thefts,\n\n-covetousness,\n\n-wickedness,\n-deceit,\n\n-lasciviousness,\n\n-an evil eye,\n\n-blasphemy,\n\n-pride,\n\n-foolishness:\n\n-all these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”\nThis weighty truth, thus emphasized, writes folly on all modern\nattempts to improve human nature; because they all proceed on the\nfalse assumption that it is what goes into the man that defiles him, and\nignore the solemn fact that in the natural heart there is “no good thing”\n(Rom. 7:18). Until, therefore, a new heart has been given by God, all\nattempts to make black white will be labour in vain. Compare Mat.\n15:18-20.\n\nLuk. 17:27-30.-“They did eat,\n-they drank,\n-they married wives,\n-they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the\nark,\nand the Flood came, and destroyed them all.\n“Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,\n-they drank,\n-they bought,\n-they sold,\n-they planted,\n-they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom\nit rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.\nEven thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.”\nRom. 1:29-31.-A long list is given of the marks of the “reprobate\nmind,” and We are taken through the awful catalogue, and hastened\non to the climax in verse 32, that the righteous sentence of God has\nbeen passed, and only judgment now awaits them that “not only do\nthe same, but have pleasure” in them that do them.\n\n1Co. 3:12-13.-“Now if any man build upon this foundation gold,\n\n-silver,\n\n-precious stones,\n\n-wood,\n\n-hay,\n\n-stubble;\n\nevery man’s work shall be made manifest; for the day shall\ndeclare it,” etc.\n\nHere it is the consequence which is emphasized by the climax\nthus led up to. The builder here is the minister, and the work is\nministerial.\n\nThose who have been reformed or apparently converted by human\npersuasion or other influences working and acting on the flesh, are\nlike “wood, hay, stubble;” and will be burnt up in that day; for, as the\nLord Jesus declared (using the work of a husbandman as the\nillustration, instead of, as here, the work of the builder), “every plant\nwhich my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up” (Mat.\n15:13).\n\nBut those who have been converted by God (and not merely as\nthe popular phrase goes “to God”) shall be as “gold, silver, precious\nstones,” for whom the fire shall have “no hurt.”\n1Co. 12:28-31.-“And God hath set some in the church,\n\n-first apostles,\n\n-secondarily prophets,\n-thirdly teachers,\n\n-after that miracles,\n\n-then gifts of healings,\n-helps,\n\n-governments,\n\n-diversities of tongues.\n\nAre all apostles?\n\n-are all prophets?\n\n-are all teachers?\n\n-are all workers of miracles?\n-Have all the gifts of healing?\n-Do all speak with tongues?\n-Do all interpret?\n\nBut covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show | unto you a\nmore excellent way.”\n\nHere we have part of the revelation concerning the Mystical body\nof Christ.\n\nIt commences at verse 1:-\n\nА 12:1-11. Nine gifts which God has given to His Church.\n\nВ 12-17. The unity of the Body. Nine enumerations.\nB 18-27. What God hath set in the Body. Eight\nenumerations.\n\nА 28-31. What God hath set in the Church. Eight gifts.\n\nThus in A and A we have the Church. And in B and B we have the\nBody. In A and A we have seventeen* [Note: For the significance of\nthis number, see Number in Scripture, by the same author and\npublisher. Also The Mystery.] enumerations, and in B and B we have\nseventeen also. These arrangements bind all four together in a\nremarkable way to show that “the Body is one.”\n1Co. 13:13.-“And now abideth faith,\n\n-hope,\n-charity,\nthese three,” etc.\n2Co. 7:5-6.-“For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had\nno rest, but\n\n-we were troubled on every side;\n\n-without were fightings,\n\n-within were fears.\n\nNevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,\ncomforted us by the coming of Titus.”\n\nGal. 5:19-21.-“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are\nthese,\n\nAdultery,\n\n-fornication,\n\n-uncleanness,\n\n-lasciviousness,\n\n-idolatry,\n\n-witchcraft,\n\n-hatred,\n\n-variance,\n\n-emulations,\n\n-wrath,\n\n-strife,\n\n-seditions,\n\n-heresies,\n\n-envyings,\n-murders,\n-drunkenness,\n-revellings, and such like: of the which | tell you before, as | have also\ntold you in time past,\nthat they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of\nGod.”\nSee also under Merismus and Synonymia.\nGal. 5:22.-“But the fruit of the Spirit is love,\n0У,\n-реасе,\n-longsuffering,\n-gentleness,\n-goodness,\n-faith,\n-meekness,\n-temperance:\nagainst such there is no law.”\nContrast this with the Polysyndeton in 2Pe. 1:5-7.\nEph. 4:32.-Contrast this with the Polysyndeton in verse 31.\n“And be ye kind one to another,\n-tenderhearted,\n-forgiving one another,\neven as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.” (Lit. “like as\nGOD also”).\nPhp. 3:5-7.-“Though | might also have confidence in the flesh\n(Greek:-‘Though | might have confidence IN THE FLESH also’).

As to his standing\nin the flesh we hear his words, “I more,” so we need not strive to gain\nit. As to his guilt as a sinner we hear his words, “I am chief,” so we\nneed not despair. For God has set him forth as a pattern showing how\nall sinners must be converted (1Ti. 1:16).\n1Th. 5:14-18.-“Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are\nunruly,\n-comfort the feeble minded,\n-support the weak,\n-be patient toward all men.\n-See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but\n-ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men.\n-Rejoice evermore.\n-Pray without ceasing.\n-In every thing give thanks:\nfor this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”\n1Ti. 1:17.-“Now unto the King\neternal,\n-immortal,\n-invisible,\n-the only wise God,\nbe honour and glory for ever and ever.

If the former is translated fitted, the latter should be fitted out-\nand-out. If the latter is rendered “furnished completely,” then the\nformer should be furnished. Perhaps the best rendering would be\n“fitted” ... “fitted out,” i.e., “that the man of God may be fitted, fitted out\nunto all good works.”\n\nThe adjective ἄρτιος (artios) is from the Ancient Aryan root AR,\nwhich means to fit. In the Greek it implies perfect adaptation and\nsuitability. The Greeks used it of time, as denoting the exact or right\nmoment; and of numbers as denoting a perfect or even number as\nopposed to an odd number.\n\nThe verb ἑξαρήζω (exartizo) means {ο fit out; and is used of\nfurnishing a house, making full preparation for war, or especially of\nfitting out a vessel for sea, in doing which every emergency must be\nprovided for-heat and cold, calm and storm, peace and war, fire and\naccident. Hence, he who studies God\'s word, will be a “man of God,”\nfitted out and provided for all the circumstances and emergencies of\nlife. But he who neglects this, and studies man’s books, will become at\nbest a man of men; he will be only what man’s wisdom can make him,\na prey for every enemy, exposed to every danger.* [Note: See The\nMan of God, a pamphlet by the same author and publisher.]\n\nThe adjective ἄρτιος occurs only here: and the verb ἑξαρτίζω only\nhere, and in Act. 21:5. The importance of this passage is shown by the\nperfection of its structure:-\n\nA а All Scripture is given by inspiration of God;\n\nЬ — апа 5 profitable\nВ _ for doctrine,\n©С for reproof,\nС for correction,\nВ {οι instruction in righteousness:\n\nА а that the man of God may be perfect;\n\nЬ — throughly furnished unto all good works.\n\nHere in A and A we have that which is connected with “Goa”; while\nin B, C and B, C, we have that which is connected with His “Word.”\nThus:-\n\nA а God\'s divinely inspired word.\n\nb — № profit to God’s man.\nВ Positive: Teaching what is true.\nс Negative: Convicting of what is wrong in\npractice.\n©С Negative: Correcting what is wrong in doctrine.\nВ Positive: Instructing in what is right.\nА а God\'s divinely-fitted man.\nb_ His profit in God’s word.\nThere is a further reference to this verse (2Ti. 3:16) in verses 2\nand 3 of the next chapter, which may be compared thus:-\nThe God-breathed Word is profitable\n2Ti. 3:16.\n2Ti. 4:2-3.\nfor doctrine:\ntherefore\nPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season;\nfor reproof:\n\ntherefore\n\nreprove,\n\nfor correction:\n\ntherefore\n\nrebuke,\n\nfor instruction in righteousness:\n\ntherefore\n\nexhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.\nThus we have the same figure in both of these corresponding\nmembers:\n2Ti. 4:2-3.-“Preach the word;\n-be instant in season, out of season;\n-reprove,\n-rebuke,\n-exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.\nFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.”\nThis important conclusion is pressed upon us and thus\nemphasized in order to show us that, when men “will not endure\nsound doctrine,” we are not to search for something to preach that\nthey will endure, but all the more earnestly and persistently we are to\n“preach the word!” Nothing else is given us to preach, whether men\nwill hear or whether they will forbear.\nJam. 1:19-20.-“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man\n(ἄνθρωπος, anthrépos) be\nswift to hear,\n-slow to speak,\n-slow to wrath:\nfor the wrath of man (ἀνδρός, andros) worketh not the\nrighteousness of God.”\nJam. 5:6.-Here the translators have inserted “and” twice in italics,\nutterly destroying the figure and hiding the conclusion.\n“Ye have condemned,\n-ye have killed the just [One];\n-He doth not resist you.\nBe patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.”\nRev. 3:7-8.-“These things saith\nHe that is holy,\n-he that is true,\n-he that hath the key of David,\n-he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man\nopeneth;\n| know thy works.”\nContrast the Polysyndeton in verses 8, 12, 17, 18.\nAmong other examples may be noted:-\nIsa. 21:11.

Promise: where some great thing is promised, too great to be\nconveyed in words\nExo. 32:31-32.-“And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this\npeople have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\nYet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, | pray thee,\nout of thy book which thou hast written.”\n\nHere it seems that Moses was about to promise something on\nbehalf of the people; but neither knew what promise he could make for\nthem, nor how far he could answer for its fulfilment by them. His\nsudden silence is solemnly eloquent.\n2Sa. 5:8.-“And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the\ngutter--.”\n\nWe learn from 1Ch. 11:6 that the promise was fulfilled in Joab, who\nwas made chief or captain. Hence these words have been supplied in\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] ‚ as we have explained above, under the figure of\nAbsolute Ellipsis, page 53.\n1Ch. 4:10.-“And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that\nthou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine\nhand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that\nit may not grieve me--”\n\nThen there is a sudden silence, as though it were impossible for\nJabez to express the manner in which he would give God thanks and\ndeclare his praise for His great mercies. But the words that\nimmediately follow seem to show that God was so much more ready\nto hear than Jabez was to pray, that without waiting for him to finish\nhis prayer it is added, “And God granted him that which he requested.”\nDan. 3:15.-“Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of\nthe cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery and dulcimer, and all kinds of\nmusic, ye fall down and worship the image which | have made -- but if\nye worship not,” etc.\n\nHere Nebuchadnezzar was ready with his threat of the\npunishment, but he was careful not to commit himself to any promise.\nLuk. 13:9 has already been treated under the figure of Ellipsis: but\nbeside the grammatical ellipsis, there is also the rhetorical: “And if it\nbear fruit--,” as though the vine-dresser would say, “I cannot say what\n| will not do for it: not only will | not cut it down, but | will continue to\ncare for it and tend it!” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has supplied the word, “well!”\n2. Anger and Threatening\nGen. 3:22.-“And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the\ntree of life, and eat, and live for ever--Therefore the Lord God sent him\nforth from the garden of Eden,” etc.\n\nHere the exact consequences of eating of the tree of life in his\nfallen condition are left unrevealed, as though they were too awful to\nbe contemplated: and the sudden silence leaves us in the darkness in\nwhich the Fall involved us. But we may at least understand that\nwhatever might be involved in this unspoken threatening, it included\nthis fact:-/ will drive him away from the tree of life!\n\nGen. 20:3.-“Behold, thou art but a dead man-- for the woman which\nthou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.”\n\nHere, we must supply # thou dost not restore her; or, her husband\nwill slay thee. This is clear from verse 7.\n\nJam. 3:1.-“My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall\nreceive the greater condemnation--.”\n\nHe does not stop to specify what the many things are, in which\nthose who occupy such positions may give cause of condemnation.\nThis is also to be understood as if it continued “unless we give a right\njudgment,” etc. (Mat. 7:2).\n\n3. Grief and Complaint\nGen. 25:22.-\"If it be so, why am | thus--?”\n\nRebekah’s words of grief and complaint are not completed. She\ncould not understand why, if Jehovah was intreated and answered\nIsaac’s prayer, she should so suffer that the answer was almost as\nhard to be borne as her former condition.\n\nJdg. 5:29-30.-There is a wonderful Aposiopesis here, where the\nmother of Sisera looks out of her lattice and wonders where Sisera is,\nand why he does not return. Her wise ladies answered her, “But she\nrepeated her words to herself.” Her soliloquy ends in a sudden\nsilence. Everything is left to the imagination as to how she bears it. All\nis lost in the sudden outburst Of the song “So perish all thy foes, O\nJehovah”! See under Homoeopropheron.\n\nPsa. 6:3.-“My soul is also sore vexed; but thou, O Lord, how long--?”\n\nThe words are drowned in grief: “How long shall | be sore vexed?\nHow long [before thou wilt arise?]’ Thus his prayer is submitted to the\nwill of God.\n\nLuk. 15:21.-“Father, | have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight,\nand am no more worthy to be called thy son--.”\n\nIt is as though, broken down by the grief which the utterance of\nthese words brought into his heart, he could not continue, and say the\nrest of what, we are told, he had resolved to say in verse 19.\nOr it is also to show us as well, that the father’s joy to receive is so\ngreat that he would not wait for the son to finish, but anticipated him\nwith his seven-fold blessing.\n\nSee under Polysyndeton.\n\nLuk. 19:42.-“If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,\nthe things which belong unto thy peace--! but now they are hid from\nthine eyes.”\n\nThe blessedness involved in this knowledge is overwhelmed by\nthe tribulation which is to come upon the nation.\n\nThe continuation of the sense would probably be “How happy thou\nwouldest have been! How blessed! How safe! How secure! but now\nthey are hid from thine eyes.”\n\n4. Enquiry and Deprecation\nHos. 9:14.-“Give them, О Lord: what wilt thou give--?” As though\nunable to conceive the punishment deserved, the Prophet breaks off\nand goes back to the thought of verse 11.\nJoh. 6:62.-“And if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he\nwas before--?”\n\nThis has already been referred to under Ellipsis (see p. 54). But\nsomething more is implied; more than can be supplied by any specific\nwords, such as, “Will ye believe then?” For He did afterwards ascend\nup, but they still refused to believe!\nAct. 23:9.-According to some ancient MSS. all the critical Greek texts\nread the verse, “We find no evil in this man: but, if a spirit or an angel\nhath spoken to him--.”\n\nEither the Pharisees were afraid to express their thoughts, or their\nwords were drowned in the “great dissension” (verse 10) which\nimmediately “arose.” For there is a sudden silence, which some\ncopyists have attempted to fill up by adding the words ur) θεομαχῶμεν.\n(mee theomach?men), “let us not fight against God.”',''),(7,7,'meiosis','Gen. 18:27.-“And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, | have\ntaken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.”\n\nHere Abraham humbles himself; and, alluding to the creation of\nman out of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7), he implies much more\nthan he expresses. In calling himself “dust and ashes,” he contrasts\nhimself with the high and holy God whom he is addressing, and takes\nthe place of a man most vile and a creature most abject. So Jehovah\nuses the same figure in 1Ki. 16:2. Psa. 113:7, &c. See under\nSynecdoche.\n\nNum. 13:33.-“And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so\nwe were in their sight.” This is the Meiosis of unbelief. To gain\ncredence for their words they exaggerated the size of the Anakim by\nlessening their own stature. On the other hand, the language of faith\nused a very different figure. Compare 14:9, under the Figure of\nEllipsis, page 37.\n1Sa. 24:14.-“After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom\ndost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea,” i.e., you do that\nwhich is altogether unworthy of a king, in pursuing one who is as\nharmless as a dead dog (compare 17:43; 2Sa. 3:8; 2Sa. 9:8; 2Sa.\n16:9) and as worthless as a flea, which is poor game for a royal hunter\n(1Sa. 26:20).\n\nEzr. 9:8.-“And now for a little space (Heb. moment) grace hath been\nshewed from the Lord our God.” To magnify the greatness of the grace\nthe Holy Spirit, by Ezra, speaks of the “little space.” The comparison is\nnot to the greatness of their transgressions, which are stated in verses\n6 and 7, etc., but to their length and the length of the previous\nchastisement, which had been begun by the kings of Assyria. See\nNeh. 9:32, and Ezr. 6:22, where Cyrus, “the king of Babylon” (5:13), is\ncalled the king of Assyria, having absorbed the kingdoms of Media,\nPersia, and Assyria, and thus the oppressor, by God’s grace, had\nbecome the friend.\nPsa. 22:6.-“I am a worm, and no man.” Here, as elsewhere, this figure\nis used to denote a much greater depth of humility and affliction than\nwords can express. So Job. 25:6. Isa. 41:14. The greater the\nhumiliation, the greater the contrast with His glorification: for He who is\n“a worm and no man” in Psa. 22:1-31 is “Jehovah my shepherd” of\nPsa. 23:1-6, and “the King of glory” of Psa. 24:1-10 In these three\nPsalms we thus have in xxii. “the Good Shepherd” in death (Joh.\n10:11); “the Great Shepherd” in resurrection (Heb. 13:20; and “the\nChief Shepherd” in glory (1Pe. 5:4).\nIsa. 40:15.-“Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are\ncounted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the\nisles as a very little thing.”\n\nAnd even this fails to convey to our minds the wondrous gulf\nbetween the finite and the infinite.\n\nVerse 17: “All nations before him are as nothing: and they are\ncounted to him less than nothing and vanity.”\nMat. 15:26.-“It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to\ndogs.” It is not only not fair, but it is cruel to one’s children thus to\ndeprive them of their food.\n\nSee further under the figure of Hypocatastasis.\nMat. 18:14.-“Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in\nheaven, that one of these little ones should perish.”\n\nNo! It is contrary to His wish. His will embraces much more than\nthis, it includes:-\n\nPredestination (Eph. 1:5).\n\nRegeneration (Joh. 1:13; Jam. 1:18).\n\nDeliverance from the world (Gal. 1:4).\n\nSanctification (1Th. 4:3; Heb. 10:10).\n\nFinal Preservation, Resurrection, and Eternal Life (Joh. 6:39-40).\nMat. 22:3.-“And they would not come.” The Greek is:-oUk ἤθελον\nἐλθεῖν (οι eethelon elthein), they did not wish to come, this is\nenhancing, by Meiosis, the fact that they not only absolutely refused,\nbut in doing so they acted only on the wish of their heart.\n\nLuk. 17:9.-“Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that\nwere commanded him? | trow not.” {.6., | think not. More is to be\nunderstood than is expressed: i.e., | know very well he doth not thank\nhim. So far from that, he scarcely notices the matter.\n\nJoh. 15:20.-“If they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also,”\ni.é., as surely as they have NOT kept my saying, they will not keep\nyours. The whole context shows that this must be the figure of\nMeiosis.\n\nRom. 10:19.- will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no\npeople.” οὐκ ἔθνος (ouk ethnos), а non-people. So 1Pe. 2:10 : “Which\nin time past were not a people,” ой λαός\" [Note: This is not the same\nas Rom. 9:26, where the pronoun “my” is used.] (ou laos). Owing to\nthe reversive power of the negative our own word “nothing” is literally\na non-thing, i.e., a thing which has no existence at all.t [Note: In Amo.\n6:13, “a thing of naught” is the same, а non-existent-thing]\n\nSuch were we Gentiles. But through grace, “a people” is now\nbeing taken out from among all nations (Act. 15:14. Rev. 5:9; Rev.\n7:9), which shall have an existence for ever and ever.\n1Со. 9:17.-“For if | do this thing willingly, | have a reward.” He means\ngratuitously; but lessens the wording, so as to increase his meaning.\nSee also under Oxymoron.\n1Со. 15:9.-“I am the least of the apostles.” This is said to magnify the\ngrace of God (verse 10). Whereas, when magnifying his claims, he\ncould say to these same Corinthians, “I suppose | was not a whit\nbehind the very chiefest apostles” (2Co. 11:5; 2Co. 12:11-12).\nEph. 3:8.-“Who am less than the least of all saints.” This marks the\napostle’s growth in grace, who a year after could say he was “the chief\nof sinners” (1Ti. 1:15). See also under Oxymoron.\n\nPhilem. 11.-“Which in time past was to thee unprofitable.” This is a\nMeiosis, for Onesimus was guilty of injury.\n\nHeb. 9:12.-“The blood of goats and calves,” (13) “the blood of bulls\nand of goats.” Here the figure lessens the importance of the sacrifices\nwhich were offered under the Law, in order to increase by contrast the\ngreat sacrifice to which they all pointed.\n\nHeb. 13:17.-“For that is unprofitable for you.” It is really much more\nthan that! It is disastrous and ruinous.\n\n1Jn. 3:17.-“But whoso hath this world’s good,” etc.\n\nHere the Greek is τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμον (ton bion tou kosmou), the\nlife of the world, i.e., the means of life or of living which the world\ngives. Whoso has this, and will not give it up for his brother, how\ndwelleth the Love of God in him? The force of the Meiosis is seen\nwhen we compare this with verse 16, “We ought to lay down our lives\nfor the brethren.” But here is a man who will not only not lay down his\nlife (ψυχή), psyche, but will not even part with the means of supporting\nit. What a contrast to true love! Hereby know we LOVE, because HE\nlaid down His life for us.',''),(8,8,'tapeinosis','1. Positively\nONE (231) in the plural (in Heb.) is used for a few or some:-\nGen. 27:44.-“Tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn\naway.”\n\nWe learn from 29:20 that the love which he bore to Rachel is\nemphasized by speaking of the seven years in which he served for her\nas “a few days.”\n\nSOME (tic) in plural (in Greek) is used for the greater number:-\nRom. 3:3.-“For what if some did not believe?” Our attention is by this\nat once pointed to the fact that it was in reality the very opposite. It\nwas only “some” who believed, while the nation as a whole did not\nbelieve.\n1Ti. 4:1.-“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times\nsome shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits\n(πνεύµασιν πλάνοις, wandering or deceiving spirits or angels), and\nteachings of demons:” i.e., a vast number of people will be deceived\nby evil angels and demons in these last days.\n\nAct. 5:36.-“Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody” (τινα) i.e.,\nsome great person; as is explained in Act. 8:9.\n\nGal. 2:6.-“But of these who seemed to be somewhat (1!).” They\nseemed to be something, really they were nothing (6:3).\nSICK, for those who were dead in sins:\nRom. 5:6.-“For when we were yet without strength” (ἀσθενῶν,\nasthen?n, sick).

Negatively\nWhen the emphasis is made by the use of the negative in order to\nexpress the positive in a very high degree, this is the figure of\nAntenantiosis (see above).\n\nWhen we say of a man that “he is no fool,” we mean that he is very\nwise; or when we say of a thing, “it is not a hundred miles from here,”\nwe mean that it is quite close at hand. We thus emphasize that which\nwe seem to lessen: e.g., when it is written, “I praise you not,” it means\n| greatly blame you!\n\nExo. 20:7.-“The Lord will not hold him guiltless:” i.e., He will hold him\nguilty of breaking the whole law.\n\nLev. 10:1.-They “offered strange fire before the Lord, which he had\ncommanded them not.” Here, the figure is translated. The Heb. is\nliterally, “which the Lord had not commanded them,” j.e., He had very\nsolemnly prohibited it; see Exo. 30:9.\n\nNum. 21:23.-“And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his\nborder.” Heb.: “would not give permission,” i.e., he did more, he\nprohibited them, as the verse goes on to explain, and opposed them\neven to the extent of using force.\n\nPsa. 43:1.-“Plead my cause against an ungodly (margin, Heb.,\n‘unmerciful’) nation.” Heb.

It is a\nstrong positive and earnest desire that they might assuredly know and\nbe well instructed.\n\nIgnorance is man’s special human infirmity. Animals know more\nthan man (Isa. 1:3). No animal is so helpless as man in the years of\ninfancy.\n\nIt is remarkable, therefore, that in connection with the Church of\nGod, and the epistles addressed to churches as such, containing the\nspecial instruction neccssary in consequence of man’s ignorance\nconcerning the church as the mystery of God, there are six different\noccasions on which it is written: “I would not have you ignorant,\nbrethren.”\n\n“SIX” is the number specially significant of man. Man was created\non the sixth day; and, wherever in Scripture we have this number or\nany multiple of it, it always stamps the subject as having to do with\nMan.* [Note: Many illustrations of this will be found in Number in\nScripture, by the same author and publisher.]\n\nThe significance of these six occurrences of this weighty\nexpression will be seen by those who have patience to work them out\nin the order in which they are given to us by the Holy Spirit.\n\nRom. 1:13.

Hence the expression, “not according to\nknowledge,” by the figure of Tapeinosis means really with great\nblindness.\n\nRom. 13:10.-“Love worketh no ill to his neighbour’: i.e., it refuses to\nwork ill, and not only so, but it works good for his neighbour.\n\n1Со. 2:14.-“The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of\nGod”: i.e., he does more than this, he rejects them, he will not have\nthem: why? “For they are foolishness unto him.” This on the one hand\nconstitutes the guilt of man in the invariable result of the exercise of\nhis “free-will”: while on the other hand it is equally true as to God’s\nsovereignty; “neither can he know them (lit., get to know them),\nbecause they are spiritually discerned.”\n\n1Со. 11:22.-“I praise you not”: i.e., | condemn you in this thing.\n\n2Co. 2:11.-\"We are not ignorant of his devices,” i.e., we are very well\naware of them.\n\nGal. 5:21.-“They which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of\nGod”: i.e., they shall not only not inherit the kingdom, but shall be cast\nout into outer darkness and destroyed without remedy.\nHeb. 11:16.-“Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God”:\ni.e., God is well-pleased to be their God, and to own them as His\nchosen people.\n\nHeb. 13:2.-“Be not forgetful to entertain strangers”: /.e., make it your\nbusiness to remember to show hospitality.\n\nRev. 12:11.-“They loved not their lives unto the death.” The fact\nimplied is that they disregarded their life to the point of death, and that\nbecause there was One whom they loved more than life and for\nwhose sake they willingly gave it up.\n\nRev. 18:7.-“l am no widow’: i.e., | am well-husbanded and prosperous.',''),(9,9,'catabasis','No content for this figure.',''),(10,10,'syllogismus','1Sa. 17:4-7.-The description of Goliath’s armour and weapons is\ngiven; and it is left for us to conclude how great his strength must have\nbeen.\n\nIsa. 2:3-4.-“Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord\nfrom Jerusalem.

Jer. 14:2. Lam. 1:4)-and the women whom many men did woo\nnow come and offer themselves to one man, renouncing the legal\nclaim of the wife (Exo. 21:10).\nIsa. 49:20.-Here the greatness of Zion’s blessing and prosperity is\nshown by the statement of the facts in verses 18-21.

So that all the members of the body of Christ died, and therefore\nthe law has no logger dominion over them (verses 5, 6).\n\nIn proof of this, an illustrative argument is used, as to the case of a\nhusband and wife. Both are bound to each other by law: and, while\nboth are alive the union of one of them with another person is\nunlawful; but, if one be dead, then such a union on the part of the\nsurvivor is legitimate.\n\nBut only one of the cases is given: viz., the death of the husband.\n\nThe death of the wife is there, but only in thought; and this other\npremiss has to be supplied by the mind in the course of the argument.\n\nSo that after the third verse we must add the other premiss in\nsome such words as these:-\n\n“And if the wife die, | need not say that she is free’; or, “but it goes\nwithout saying that if the wife die, of course she is free.”\n\nWherefore (as the conclusion is given in verse 6) we died in Christ,\nand are therefore free from that law wherein we were held; for “he that\nhas once so died stands justified (the penalty having been paid) from\nhis sin.\n\nNow if we died with Christ we have been raised also with Him (6:8.\nCol. 2:12). Thus we were planted together with Him in “His death, and\nraised with Him (6:4) to newness of life. And be it noted that this is no\nmere marriage union. To prevent this conclusion the verb to marry is\nnot used in verses 3 and 4. There, instead of the usual verb marry,\nwhich we should expect to find, we have the verb to become, with the\ndative case; and must in each instance supply the Ellipsis. In the case\nof the woman, she “becomes” joined, “becomes” bound under the law\nto a husband; but, in the case of those who died with Christ, they\n“become” united to Him as members of His body and “become” His\nproperty. Their union with Him is not in Incarnation, but in death,\nburial, and resurrection; and having died with Him are freed from the\nLaw, instead of being bound to it.\n\nMat. 27:19.-“Have thou nothing to do with that just man.”\n\nHere the fire, and feeling, and urgency of Pilate’s wife is all the\nmore forcible, in that she does not stop to formulate a tame, cold\nargument, but she omits the major premiss; which is greatly\nemphasized by being left for Pilate to supply. The complete Syllogism\nwould have been:\n\n1. It is very wicked to punish a just or innocent man.\n\n2. Jesus is a just man.\n\n3. Have therefore nothing to do with punishing him.\n\nThe conclusion thus contains the proof of each of the premisses\non which it rests.\n\nThus is emphasized one of the four testimonies borne to the\ninnocence of the Lord Jesus by Gentiles at the time of His\ncondemnation.\n\n1. Pilate’s wife (Mat. 27:19).\n\n2. Pilate himself, “I am innocent of the blood of this just person”\n(Mat. 27:24).\n\n3. The dying malefactor, “This man hath done nothing amiss” (Luk.\n23:41).\n\n4.

The former word occurs nowhere else in the N.T.;\nthe latter only here, and in Eph. 3:8, where it is rendered “unsearch-\nable”:-“The unsearchable riches of Christ.” This does not merely\nvaguely express that Christ\'s riches are uncountable or untold, but\nthat they cannot be traced out. The context shows that this present\ninterval between “the sufferings of Christ” and “the glory that should\nfollow,” had been kept a secret (μυστήριον, musteerion, or mystery),\nand had not been revealed, until it was made known by the Spirit\nthrough Paul (Rom. 16:25-26. Eph. 3:2-11. Col. 1:26-27). The\nprophets sought to know the secret as to “what or what manner of\ntime” the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify: but, it was\nuntrackable; they could not follow it: His ways were “past finding out.”*\n[Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.]\n1Th. 1:2.-“We give thanks to God always for you all.” The last words\nare emphasized by being put as a beautiful Homoeo-propheron.

It is as though we could render it, “We have\npiped for you, and ye never stept; we dirged for you, and ye never\nwept.” Though this would emphasize it, it would be by another figure\n(Paronomasia, q.v.

[Note: Which\nsee] ).\nPsa. 111:1-10\nοχι. a 1-3-1 His righteousness for ever.\nb 4-8.-C Gracious and full of compassion; ever mindful\nof His covenant.\nο 9, 10-0 His covenant and praise for ever.\nPsa. 112:1-10\n1128. 1-3.-[ His righteousness for ever.\nЬ — 4-8.-С Gracious and full of compassion; in everlasting\nremembrance.\nο 9, 10-0 His exaltation for ever.\nPsa. 119:1-176 -This Acrostic Psalm differs from every other. It\nconsists of 176 verses, divided into 22 groups of eight verses each: (8\nX 22 = 176). The eight verses of each group begin with the same\nletter. For example: the first eight verses each begin with Aleph Г (А),\nthe second eight with Beth a (B); and so on through the whole Psalm.\n\nIt is very difficult to preserve this in a translation, and impossible\nwhere the letters of one language are not the same either in power or\nnumber or order.\n\nIt so happens, however, that the ninth portion (verses 65-72), in\nwhich each verse begins with Teth ё (T), begins also with T in the\nAuthorized Version in all the verses except two (67 and 71). These\ncan be easily made to begin with T also, by changing the word\n“Before” in verse 67 to Till; and the words “It is” in verse 71 to ’Tis.\nThen it will exactly correspond to the Hebrew original.\n\nAttempts have been made to render other portions in a similar\nmanner, but with little success. What comes naturally in an Original\nText, must be somewhat forced in translating it into another language.\nWe offer the following as an example:-\n\nA.\nAh! the happinesses of the perfect in the way,\nSuch as walk in the law of Jehovah.\nAh! the happinesses of the keepers of His testimonies,\nWho seek Him with their whole heart.\nAssuredly they have not worked iniquity:\nIn His ways they ever walked.\nAs to Thy commandments-Thou hast commanded us,\nThat we should diligently keep them.\nAh! Lord, that my ways were prepared\nTo keep Thy statutes.\nAshamed, then, | shall never be,\nWhile | have respect unto all Thy commandments.\nAll my heart shall praise Thee in uprightness,\nWhile | learn the judgments of Thy righteousness.\nAll Thy statutes also | will keep:\nLeave me not utterly.\nB.\nBy what means shall a young man cleanse his way?\nBy taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\nBy every means my heart hath sought Thee:\nLet me not err from Thy commandments.\nBesides, | have laid up Thy word in my heart,\nThat | might not sin against Thee.\nBlessed art Thou, O Jehovah,\nTeach me Thy statutes.\nBy my lips have | recounted\nAll the judgments of Thy mouth.\nBy walking in Thy Mandate’s way,\n| found joy beyond all wealth.\nBy Thy precepts shall | guide my musings,\nAnd shall pore o’er Thy paths,\nBy thy statutes shall | be delighted;\nThy word | shall not forget.\nPsa. 145:1-21 -Here the Acrostic is perfect, with the exception of the\nletter Nun, d (N), which comes between verses 13 and 14.\n\nIt has evidently dropped out through the carelessness of some\nscribe; for it must have been in the manuscripts from which the\nSeptuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic and Zthiopic Versions were made,\nas they contain the verse. One Hebrew ms. has been found by Dr.\nGinsburg containing the verse; which reads, “The Lord is faithful in all\nHis words, and holy in all His works.”\n\nMoreover, it falls in with the structure of the Psalm, for the\nmember, in which verse nun (d) occurs, consists of verses 13-20 and\nis as follows:-\n\nа 13. “Thou,” second person.\n\nЬ — 14. “He,” third person.\nа 15, 16. “Thou,” second person.\nЬ 17-20. “He,” third person.\nThe members b and b thus commence with similar words.\nThe Psalm is “David\'s Psalm of praise.” It is the only Psalm that is\ndignified by this title. It is a special Psalm, therefore, and the Acrostic\nmarks it as such, there being exactly 22 verses, one letter for each\nverse, and each verse consisting of two lines.\n\nThe structure (see under Correspondence) shows that it consists\nof seven members, arranged alternately, the subject of the first being\nPraise promised, and that of the second, Praise offered in fulfilment of\nthat promise.\n\nIt is as follows:-\n\nPsa. 145:1-21\nА1 1, 2. Praise promised (first person) for Jehovah Himself.\nB1 3. Praise offered (third person) to Jehovah.\nA2 4-7. Praise promised (first and third persons alternately) for\nJehovah\'s works.\nB2 8, 9. Praise offered (third person) for Jehovah\'s works.\nA3 10-12. Praise promised (third person only) for Jehovah’s\nkingdom.\nB3 13-20. Praise offered (third person) for Jehovah’s kingdom.\nA4 21. Praise promised (first and third persons) (eare, shall\nbless, as in verse 10).\nPro. 31:10-31 is a perfect alphabetical Acrostic, marking and calling\nour attention to this song in praise of a virtuous woman. Офаепет\ncalls it “a golden A B C for women.” It follows here, the words of a\nfaithful mother. The following is the structure of the passage:-\nΑ 10. The woman and her worth.\nB1 11, 12. Her husband.\nC 13-22. Her work.\nB2 23. Her husband.\nC 24-27. Her work.\nB3 28, 29. Her children and her husband.\nΑ 30, 31. The woman and her worth.\nLike Psa. 145:1-21 it consists of twenty-two verses, and each\nverse contains two lines.\nLam. 1:1-22 is an acrostic chapter. It consists of 22 verses, each of\nwhich commences with a successive letter of the alphabet, and each\nconsists of three lines, except verse 7 (ό, Zayin) which contains four\nlines.\nLam. 2:1-22 is the same, except that in this case it is verse 19 (-,\nKoph) which contains four lines. Й and ὃ (verses 16 and 17) are\ntransposed.\nLam. 3:1-66 is different. It consists of 66 verses; the first three each\ncommencing with f(A); the second three each commencing with\n\n(B), and so on. Here, also as in chap. 2, Й and ὃ (verses 46-48\nand 49-51) are transposed.\nLam. 4:1-22 -Here, there are 22 verses, each verse commencing\nsuccessively with the letters of the alphabet, and consisting of two\nlines. Here, also as in chaps. 2 and 3, the Й апа ὃ (verses 16 and 17)\nare designedly transposed.\n\nThese are all the Alphabetical Acrostics.\n\nThere are, however, others, to which our attention is called by the\nMassorah, as well as by their being written in larger characters in\ncertain Manuscripts.\n\nIn these cases the Acrostic letters spell certain words. But these\nare no more accidental than those which are alphabetical. Other\nacrostics have been found; but, as they are without Massoretic or\nManuscript authority (and, therefore, probably are undesigned) we do\nnot notice them.\n\nPsa. 96:11.-The Massorah has a rubric calling attention to the name\nof Jehovah here in a complete sentence of four words:-* [Note:\nReading the English words backwards.]\n\nёшс! Auiei Ιά8ό aris\nearth-the glad-be-let-and heavens-the rejoice-Let.\n\n“Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad” (lit., “Let-rejoice\nthe-heavens and-let-be-glad the-earth’).\n\nThis is the great truth and the grand climax of God’s purposes,\nwhich the Psalms as a whole set forth and declare. Especially so in\nthis fourth book of the Psalms, which reveals those purposes in\nrelation to the earth.\n\nPsa. 96:1-13 is a call to “all the earth” (verse 1) to sing the “new\nsong,” and Psa. 97:1-12 is, or rather will yet be, the earth’s glad\nanswer to that call.* [Note: See A Key to the Psalms.]\n\nEsther.-In the Book of Esther four times the name of Jehovah occurs\nin the form of an Acrostic.t [Note: See a separate pamphlet on this\nsubject by the same author and publisher, The Name of Jehovah in\nthe Book of Esther.]\n\nJehovah had declared (Deu. 31:16-18) that if His people forsook\nHim He would hide His face from them. Here this threatening was\nfulfilled. But, though He was hidden from them, He was present,\nworking for them, to deliver them. Hence the outward form of the book\nis in harmony with the circumstances of the people: Jehovah was not\nwith them, but He was for them; and therefore, though His name does\nnot occur so that it may be sounded and pronounced by the voice, it\nappears, so that it may be visible to the opened eyes.\nFurther, the four Acrostics are all different from each other.\nThe First\noccurs in 1:20. It is formed by the initial letters, for the event was\ninitial. It is formed by spelling the word backwards, for Jehovah was\noverruling and turning back the wisdom of man. The four Hebrew\nwords are\nавг les Gavi Cua\nie., “All the wives shall give,” or exhibiting a similar Acrostic in\nEnglish-\n“Due Respect Our Ladies”\nshall give to their husbands, etc.”\nThis counsel resulted in bringing Esther to the throne; so that,\nwhen Haman’s plot had been made, it might be thwarted (4:14).\nThe Second\n(5:4) is formed, as before, by the initial letters; for Jehovah was\ninitiating His plans: but it is spelt forwards (as in our common form of\nAcrostics), for Jehovah was ruling rather than overruling. The four\nHebrew words are-\nCait aida laia а!\n“Let the King and Haman come this day,” or,\n“Let Our Royal Dinner\n\nbe graced this day by the King and Haman.” The name of Jehovah\nappears in the invitation; for He was to be there in order to bring the\ncounsels of man to nought and” take the wise in their own craftiness.”\n\nNothing happens at the dinner beyond an invitation to Haman to\ndine at the royal table the next day. “Then went Haman forth that day\njoyful and with a glad heart” (5:9). Yes, “that day,” for it was his last!\n\nThe Third Acrostic\n(5:13) is the beginning of the end. Hence it is formed by the final\nletters, for the end was approaching. It is read backwards, for the Lord\nwas turning back all the proud purposes of Haman. Haman goes\nhome to his wife and says:\n\nса réaal via ee\n“This availeth me nothing,” or “Yet am |\n\nsaD, foR nO avail.\n\nis all this to me.”\n\nThis sadness was a precursor of, and foreboded, his coming\nexecution. Haman dines on the morrow with the king and queen; and\nevents soon reached their climax; which comes in\n\nThe Fourth Acrostic\n(7:7). It is again in the final letters, for Haman’s end had come. It is\nspelt forwards; for Jehovah was ruling, and had determined the\nevent:-\nвё 66ua (δ6ἱ ата\n\nHaman saw “that evil was determined against him,” or, “For he\n\nsaw that there was\neviL tO feaR determineD\nagainst him by the King.”\n\nThere was indeed evil to fear: for that evil had been determined\nnot by King Ahasuerus, but by Jehovah: and the evil came swiftly\nupon him, for he was at once taken out and hanged.\n\nThus these four Acrostics at once conceal and reveal the Name of\nJehovah, and emphasize the four pivots on which the whole history\nturns.\n\nEst. 7:5.-This is another Acrostic for which there is Massoretic\nauthority, the letters being written in larger characters in certain MSS\n\nIt is that name by which God revealed himself to Moses and to\nIsrael, the “I AM,” who had come down to deliver them. He who came\ndown to deliver them in Egypt now comes down to deliver them in\nPersia: and, though He was not revealed, nor His name written, yet\nHe has caused it to be emblazoned on the pages of the history.\nWhen Ahasuerus learned from Esther, that “the Jews’ enemy” had\nlaid his plot to destroy the whole nation, he cries out in his ignorance,\n“Who is he, and where is he\nthat durst presume in his heart to do so?” He uses the words of which\nthe final letters spell the name EHJHE (pronounced E-he-yhe both\nbackwards and forwards).\nall са г© са аГ\nEHEYEH knew who Haman was and where he was. He who is the\ngreat “I am,” sees the end from the beginning; and both rules and\nover-rules all events for the accomplishment of His purposes, and for\nthe deliverance of His People. (See Exo. 2:23-25; Exo. 3:14-15).\nAcrostics, like many other figures, occur only in the Originals, and\ncannot be reproduced in a translation.\nIt is possible also for figures to occur in a translation which are not\nin the Hebrew or Greek! In such cases they are, of course, either\naccidental or designed. In either case they are of no value or weight.\nAn Acrostic can be made, for example, in the English of Joh. 3:16,\nwhich is accidental. But as it may be useful to some in teaching\nothers, we note it here-\n\nJoh. 3:16\n\nGod so loved the world, that he gave his\n\nOnly begotten\n\nSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not\n\nPerish, but have\n\nEverlasting\n\nLife.\n\nThis verse contains the good news of the Gospel, which, by a\nsingular coincidence, is the very word which may thus be written as an\nAcrostic.\n\n2. Of the Same Word\n(a) In the Same Sense\nThere are no less than twelve ways in which the same word may be\nrepeated in the same sense in the same sentence. The first is called (next)',''),(17,17,'epizeuxis','Gen. 6:17.-“And, behold, I, even, I, do bring a flood of waters upon\nthe earth.”\nGen. 7:19.-“And the waters prevailed exceedingly.”\n\nHere, as in other passages, the doubled adverb is used for a\nsuperlative. ira ira (тефа, тефа), greatly, greatly. We have the\nsame words in 17:2, “And | will multiply thee exceedingly (тефа,\nтефа). So also verse 6, exceeding; and verse 20, exceedingly;\n30:43, “And the man increased exceedingly (тефа, тефа)”; Exo.\n1:7, “Waxed exceeding”; Num. 14:7, “It is an exceeding (тефа,\nππεφα)) good land”; 1К!. 7:47, “Because they were exceeding (тефа,\nтефа) many”; 2Ki. 10:4, “But they were exceedingly (тефа, тефа)\nafraid”; Eze. 9:9, “And Judah is exceeding (тефа, тефа) great”;\n16:13, “And thou wast exceeding (med, тефа) beautiful’; 37:10,\n“An exceeding (тефа, meqbd) great army.”\n\nGen. 22:11.-“And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven,\nand said, Abraham, Abraham.”\n\nThis is the first occurrence of this figure, used of names. There are\nten such in the Scriptures (the number ten completing the cycle of\nDivine order).* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author\nand publisher.]\nSeven of these are used by God to man (four of which are in the\nOld Testament, and three in the New), the other three being used\nunder other circumstances. When thus used, the figure calls special\nattention to the occasion or to the person, and to some solemn\nmoment of importance in the action, or of significance in the words.\n\nUsed by God to men. (7)\nOld Test. (4)\n\n1. Abraham, Abraham (Gen. 22:11).\n\n2. Jacob, Jacob (Gen. 46:2).\n\n3. Moses, Moses (Exo. 3:4).\n\n4. Samuel, Samuel (1Sa. 3:10).\n\nNew Test. (3)\n5.

Christ “fans” to get rid of the\nchaff (Mat. 3:12).] (Luk. 22:31).\n7. Saul, Saul (Act. 9:4).\nUsed under other circumstances.} [Note: Each of these three\nexamples is unique.

Psa. 22:1).\nIt is to be noted that in raising the dead the Lord Jesus never used\nthis figure! As much as to say it needed no emphasis whatever to\nmake the dead hear His voice (see Mar. 5:41).\n\nThe disciples may cry, “Master, Master, we perish!” (Luk. 8:24),\nbut He calmly rebukes the winds and the waves.\n\nGen. 25:30.-“And Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me, | pray thee, with that\nsame red pottage.”\n\nThe Hebrew having no superlative, doubles the adjective (see\nunder /diom), afai arai (hah-ahdom, hah-ahdom), red, red, ie.,\nthis very red [food]; or, this deliciously red food.\n\nExo. 2:12.-“And he looked this way and that way.”\n\nHere the Hebrew GA [65 (ΚΦΗ ναΗΚΦΗ), this and this, is well\ntranslated, The repetition emphasizes the fact that he looked in every\ndirection. See also Jos. 8:20, i.e., in any direction. 2Ki. 2:8. Also Jos.\n8:33, 1Са ПСа (mizzeh oomizzeh), i-e., on all sides. 1Ki. 2:36, “Go\nnot forth thence any-whither” fda lfda (ahneh vah-ah-nah), this\nand this. 2Ki. 4:35, see margin.\nExo. 4:16.-“And he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a\nmouth:” i.e., he shall surely be, etc.\nExo. 15:16.-“Till thy people pass over, О Lord, till the people pass\nover, which thou hast purchased:” i.e., till thy people have completely\npassed over and are safe on the other side.\nExo. 23:30.-“By little and little | will drive them out from before thee,”\nIAS IAS (me-at, me-at), “little, little, | will drive, etc.:” ie., | will drive\nthem out by very slow degrees. There s no “by” or “and” in the Hebrew\nof this passage. These words should be in italics. The figure is\nbeautifully rendered in English idiom, where two adverbs are used to\nexpress the superlative.\nExo. 28:34.-“A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a\npomegranate upon the hem of the robe round about:” /.е., alternately.\nExo. 34:6.-“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed,\nJEHOVAH, JEHOVAH.”\n\nHere, if we were to translate the figure idiomatically, it means that\nHe proclaimed the wonderful name, Jehovah! (which He did in the\nsixth and seventh verses).\nLev. 6:12 (5).-“And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning.”\naa-f aa-t (babbopker, babbabker), morning, morning: i.e., every\nmorning, regularly, and without intermission.\n\nLev. 24:8.-“Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord\ncontinually.”\n\nHebrew aéli Δὐάή aéli auau (Веуфт hashabbath beyom\n\nhashabbath), on-the-day-of the-Sabbath, on-the-day-of the-\nSabbath: i.e., every Sabbath, with emphasis on the word “every,” i.e.,\nevery Sabbath without fail.\nNum. 17:12-13 (27, 28).-After Aaron’s rod had been brought forth, the\npeople were frightened and cried to Moses, “Behold, we die, we\nperish, we all perish. Whosoever cometh near, cometh near unto\nthe tabernacle of the Lord shall die: shall we be consumed with\ndying?”\n\nHere the figure is a-Fa a-fa (hakkahrev hakkahrev), cometh\nnear, cometh near. It is idiomatically translated by the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , but\nliterally by the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nThere is also the repetition of the word faadl ‘(ahvadnoo), “we\nperish, we all perish.”\n\nDeu. 28:43.-Here the figure is really translated idiomatically, and not\nliterally. “The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very\nhigh,” ie. INGA TAGA (mahalah, mahalah), high, high; “and thou\nshalt come down very low” ({6., 168 iéa (mattah, mattah), low,\nlow).\nThus the figure emphasizes the depth of the misery into which\nIsrael should be brought if they would not hearken to the voice of\nJehovah (verse 15).\n\nJdg. 5:22.-\n\n“Then did the horsehoofs stamp:\n\nBy reason of the pransings, the pransings of his mighty\n\nones.”\n\nтаайи AaarlU (middaharoth daharoth), ie. the violent\npransings, if translated idiomatically. See under /diom.\n1Sa. 2:3.-‘Talk no more exceeding proudly.”\n\naaaa aaaa (gevohah, gevohah), proudly, proudly, ie.,\narrogantly or haughtily.\n\nHere the repeated adjective is idiomatically translated as a\nsuperlative.\n2Sa. 7:5.-“Go and tell my servant David (Heb., to my servant, to\nDavid), Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build, me a house for me to\ndwell in?”\nHere there is great emphasis to be placed on the repeated\npronoun, “me,” in order to rebuke the popular and universal thought of\nthe natural heart, which ever says, “See now, | dwell in a house of\ncedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.”\n2Sa. 18:33.-“O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would\nGod | had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!”\n\nHere the figure emphasizes the vehemence of David\'s grief.\n2Ki. 4:19.-\"And he said unto his father, My head, my head.” (//UG\nrrué, roshee, roshee.)\n\nHow eloquent: and what a volume is contained in this simple\nfigure, so naturally used by the child; as an English child would say,\n“My poor head.”\n2Ch. 4:3.-“Compassing the sea round about.” naéa naéa\n(sahveev, sahveev), around, around: i.e., completely round, all\naround. The same repetition is used, to express complete\nsurrounding, in Eze. 37:2; Eze. 40:5; Eze. 40:14; Eze. 40:16 (twice),\n17, 25, 29, 30, 33, 36, 43; 41:5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16 (the second\n“round about”), 17, 19; 42:15, 20; 43:12. In all these descriptions of\nthe new and future Temple, the repetition of naéa naéa (sahveev,\nsahveev) emphasizes the completeness of the measurements.\n\nPsa. 22:1.-\"My God, my God (/G6 [66, Elee, Elee), why hast thou\nforsaken me?”\n\nWho can tell the depth of meaning and of feeling, which this figure\nhere reveals? It is thus impressed upon us, because it cannot be\nexpressed by words. See Mar. 15:34.\n\nPsa. 67:6-7 (7, 8).-\n\n“God shall bless us,\n\nGod shall bless us:”\ni.e., God shall really and truly bless us in very deed.\nPsa. 77:16 (17).-\n\n“The waters saw thee, O God,\n\nThe waters saw thee.”\n\n(See under Prosopopoeia.) Thus emphatically describing Exo.\n14:1-31\nPsa. 96:13.-\n“For He cometh, for He cometh:”\n\ni.e., for He shall surely come.\nPsa. 118:11.-Twice “They compassed me about’; and in verses 15\nand 16, we have three times “The right hand of the Lord.”\nPsa. 137:7.-“Remember, О Lord, the children of Edom in the day of\nJerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof,”\nie, nrl-nrl ‘(ahroo, ahroo), “Down-with-it, down-with-it,” or we might\nrender the figure, utterly overthrow it.\nPro. 20:14.-“It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is\ngone his way, then he boasteth.”\n\nHeb. is m im (ra, ra), i.e., “very bad,” or “worth nothing.” What a\npicture of Eastern bargaining!\nEcc. 3:18.-Lit., | said in my heart respecting the estate of the sons of\nmen that ... they, even they are like beasts.”\n\nHere the figure of Pleonasm (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) first\nemphasizes the word “men,” and then the Epizeuxis again increases\nthat emphasis.\nEcc. 7:24.-“That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it\nout?”\n\nhi- hi- (ahmok, ahmok), deep, deep: i.e., as it is translated,\n“exceeding deep.”\nIsa. 6:3.-The holiness of Jehovah is emphasized beyond measure,\nand the three persons in one God are indicated by the thrice repeated\n“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.” Here the highest degree of\nholiness is ascribed to Jehovah.\n\nIsa. 21:9.-“Babylon is fallen, is fallen’: to emphasize the certainty\nand the greatness of the fall of that great city, and the completeness of\nits final overthrow. See also Rev. 18:2.\n\nIsa. 26:3.-“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace.”\n\nHere the figure is idiomatically translated. The Hebrew reads (see\nmargin) uéli uéli (shalom, shalom), peace, peace, thus\nemphasizing the word and denoting much peace, great peace; or, as\nin A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , “perfect peace.” In 57:19 and Jer. 6:14 it is not thus\ntranslated.\n\nProfessor Driver mentions this duplication of words as being a\npost-Isaian feature of literary style (/ntroduction to the Literature of the\nOld Testament, pp. 233, 234). He says, “The literary style of chapters\n40-56 is very different from that of Isaiah”: one of the “literary features”\nbeing the repetition of words. It is remarkable, as being characteristic\nof the wisdom and acumen assumed by the higher critics, that though\nProfessor Driver mentions the repetition of uéli Uéli, peace, peace,\nin Isa. 57:19, he does not mention the very same repetition in 26:3:\nwhich is an evidence of the very unity of the two parts of Isaiah which\nhe is seeking to disprove.* [Note: The same applies to other\narguments: e.g., Dr. Driver says (p.227) that certain words “occurring\nin chapters 40-66. point to a later period of language than Isaiah’s age\n... A remarkable instance is afforded by 65:25 ... where écal, the\ncommon Hebrew word for together, is replaced by éf¢a, an\nexpression modelled upon the Aramaic écar, and occurring besides\nonly in the latest books of the Old Testament.” But Professor Driver\ndoes not mention the fact that the word occurs in the earlier books of\nthe Bible: so early indeed as Gen. 3:22; Gen. 49:16. 1Sa. 17:36, and\nelsewhere. True, in these passages it is in the construct state: but that\nmakes no difference so far as the argument is concerned. Moreover,\nas this very word écal occurs in chap. 1:28, 31, and 11:6, 7, as well\nas in 66:17, it is an argument against Dr. Driver\'s division of Isaiah into\ntwo halves.]\n\nIsa. 28:10.-This is probably the ironical language of the “scornful men”\n(verse 14), introduced by the Ellipsis of verse 9: “Whom [say they]\nshall he teach knowledge’?... for [it is] precept upon precept; precept\nupon precept; line upon line; line upon line; here a little, and there\na little.” And, then, the Prophet retorts: “For (or Yea, verily) with\nstammering lips (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , stammerings of lips) and\nanother tongue will he speak (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , he hath\nspoken) to this people.”\n\nIn the English the Epizeuxis is not perfect, because the word\n“upon” comes between, but in the Hebrew the words follow each other\nclosely.\n\n6! 66] δἱ 6] -| ὅ-| -ἰ 6-1\n\ncneér bi cher of\nLe., “For it is tzav latzav; tzav latzav; kav lakav, kav lakav; z3hr shehm,\nzshr shehm.”\n\nSee also verse 13.\n\nIsa. 40:1.-“Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.” Here\nthe Epizeuxis consists of one word in the Hebrew, dcil- dcil-\n(nachmoo, nachmoo): and calls our attention to the passage; while it\nemphasizes the plenitude of that comfort wherewith Jehovah has\ndetermined to comfort His People Israel at no distant date.\nIsa. 51:1-23.-In this Scripture we have three calls emphasized by this\nfigure.\nА1 51:9-11. A call to the arm of Jehovah:-“Awake, awake, put on\nstrength, O arm of the Lord.”\nB1 12-16. Followed by comfort.\nA2 17-20. A call to Jerusalem:-“Awake, awake, stand up, O\nJerusalem.”\nB2 21-23. Followed by comfort.\nA3 52:1, 2. A call to Zion:-“Awake, awake, put on strength, O\nZion.”\nB3 3-12. Followed by comfort.\nIsa. 57:19.-“I create the fruit of the lips:-Peace, peace to him that is\nfar off and to him that is near,” etc.: {6., great peace, perfect peace as\nin 26:3 (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]).\nJer. 4:19.-“My bowels, my bowels!” to emphasize the great distress\nexperienced.\nJer. 6:14.-“They have healed also the hurt of the daughter* [Note:\nThese words are supplied, apparently from chap. 8:11, 21.] of my\npeople slightly, saying Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” Here\nthe figure contrasts with the fact that there was no peace for\nJerusalem the fact that her false prophets continually promised plenty\nof peace, much peace.\nJer. 22:29.-“O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.”\nEze. 21:9-13 (Hebrews 14-18).-“A sword, a sword is sharpened, and\nalso furbished.”\n\nThis is to call our attention to “the sword of the Lord,” viz., Babylon,\nand to show that His sword is a sword for war, and not a sword worn\nfor honour. This is the key to this difficult passage. That there are\ndifficulties is seen the moment we observe the italics, note the\nmarginal alternatives, and consult the commentators!\n\nJehovah’s sword was not like the sword of His son Judah, not like\nhis “rod” or “sceptre” (verse 10), which was merely for honour, and\nwas no use against a tree. But this sword (verse 10) “contemneth the\nrod (or sceptre) of my son, as [it despiseth] every tree (or wood).”\nVerse 12 should be, “Cry and howl, son of man: for it sha// be upon my\npeople, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: my people shall be\ndelivered to the sword: smite therefore upon thy thigh” (which was the\nsymbol of fear in man, as beating the breast was in woman). Verse 13.\n“Because it was proved, and what? (i.e., what will happen? what will\nbe the result?) if the sword shall not despise the wood, saith the Lord!\nIt will not be, saith Adonai Jehovah!” (i.e., it will not despise it! it will\ndestroy it!)\n\nThus we have the sword of Jehovah emphasized: and the\nstructure of these verses explains their meaning.\nА 8-10. The sword of Jehovah (Babylon). Its sharpness and\nbrightness.\nВ — -10. Its contempt for the rod or sceptre of His son Judah.\n\nА 11, 12. The sword of Jehovah. Its destroying power.\n\nВ 19. Its contempt for the wooden rod or sceptre of Judah.\n\nThe point is that the sword of the Lord is a sword of war, not of\nhonour; and its power is so great that the sceptre of Judah (which was\nof wood) will not withstand it.\n\nEze. 21:27.-‘I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no\nmore until he come whose right it is; and | will give it him”: {98., | will\ncompletely and thoroughly overturn it.\n\nThe threefold Epizeuxis emphasizes the completeness of the\noverthrow of the throne of David; hence, by implication, the certainty\nof the promised fulfilment of the prophecy that He who is David’s Son\nand David’s Lord, shall surely reign upon that same throne according\nto Luk. 1:32-33, and many other Scriptures.\n\nEze. 22:2.-“Wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge?”: i.e., Wilt thou really\nand truly judge? See under Heterosis.\n\nEze. 33:11.-“Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways.”\n\nEze. 34:11.-“Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep and seek\nthem out.”\nAnd verse 20: “Behold I, even, I, will judge between the fat cattle\nand between the lean cattle.”\nThus does Adonai Jehovah emphasize what He will do in\nconsequence of the unfaithfulness of the shepherds, who fed not His\nflock, but fed themselves. (See under Ellipsis, page 114).\n\nEze. 34:17.-‘I judge between cattle and cattle.” (da 6a)\n\nFor the emphasis in this passage, see the notes on it under the\nfigure of Ellipsis (page 40).\n\nDan. 5:11.-“Whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, /\nsay, thy father, made master of the magicians”: i.e., thy father the\ngreat and mighty king Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nDan. 10:19.-“Be strong, yea, be strong:” i.e., be very strong.\n\nZep. 1:14.-“The great day of the Lord is near, is near, and hasteth\ngreatly”: /.e., is very near.\n\nMat. 5:37.-“But let your communication (R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , speech) be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is\nmore than these cometh of evil.”\n\nHere the figure emphasizes the fact, not that we are forbidden to\nsay, “Yea” or “nay” twice; but that we are merely to say, “Yes” or “no,”\nand not to indulge in vehement asseverations and oaths; “for\nwhatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.”\n\nMat. 23:37.-“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,”\netc.: emphasizing the pathetic appeal by the exceeding guilt of the city\nin killing the prophets of Jehovah.\n\nLuk. 23:21.-“Crucify him, crucify him,” emphasizing the vehemence\nof the cry, and the determination of the priest-led people.\n\nJoh. 1:51.-“Verily, verily, | say unto you.” ἁμὴν, ἁμήν (ameen\nameen). Twenty-five solemn sayings of the Lord Jesus are thus\nemphatically marked in John’s Gospel: viz., 1:51; 3:3, 5, 11; 5:19, 24,\n25; 6:26, 32, 47, 53; 8:34, 51, 58; 10:1, 7; 12:24; 13:16, 20, 21, 38;\n14:12; 16:20, 23; 21:18. It might prove a useful study to trace the\nsequence of truth in these successive statements.\n\nApart from the Repetition, which occurs only in the fourth Gospel,\nthere is something to be learnt from the number of times the word\noccurs.* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nHeb. 10:37.-“Yet a little while,” Lit., how little, how little.” Greek: ἔτι\nyap μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον (eti gar mikron hoson hoson).\n\nEph. 3:9.-Lit. “And to enlighten all [as to] what [is] the dispensation of\nthe Mystery which has been hidden away, away, from the ages in [or\nby] God.” Showing the completeness with which the secret was hidden\nin former times. Compare Rom. 16:25, and Col. 1:26.',''),(18,18,'anaphora','Scripture abounds with this figure, which adds great importance to\nmany of its solemn statements. We give a few examples:-\nDeu. 28:3-6.-\n\n“Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and\n\nblessed shalt thou be in the field:\n\nblessed shall be the fruit of the body,\n\nand* [Note: See Polysyndeton.] the fruit of thy ground,\n\nand the fruit of thy cattle,\n\nthe increase of thy kine,\nand the flocks of thy sheep.\nblessed shall be thy basket and thy store,\nblessed shalt thou be when thou comest in,\nblessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.”\nSee the same figure in verses 16-19 with the word “cursed”\nrepeated at the beginning of successive sentences.\n2Sa. 23:5.-According to the Hebrew, each line begins with the word\néé (kee), For.\n“For is not my house thus with God?\nFor He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered\nin all things and sure,\nFor this is all my salvation, and all my desire.\nFor shall He not make it to prosper?”\nThese four lines are in the form of an introversion:-\na Question.\nЬ — Answer and Reason.\nЬ — Answer and Reason.\na Question.\nIn a and a the question is concerning David\'s house; while in b and\nb the subject is Jehovah’s covenant. See under Correspondence.\nPsa. 3:1-2 (2, 3).-\n“Many are they that rise up against me,\nMany there be which say of my soul,” etc.\nPsa. 94:3-4.-“How long” In verse 4 it should be repeated by Ellipsis\nand put in italics twice. In the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] it is thus put only once; in the\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] not at all, the figure not being\nseen.\nPsa. 115:12-13.-\n“He will bless us.\nHe will bless the house of Israel.\nHe will bless the house of Aaron.\nHe will bless them that fear the Lord.”\nThis figure stands here in immediate contrast with the figure of\nEpistrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) in verses 9-11, where the same\nphrase ends successive clauses.\n\nSee also in the Songs of Degrees, Psa. 121:7-8; Psa. 122:6-7;\nPsa. 123:2-3; Psa. 124:1-2; Psa. 3:1-8; Psa. 4:1-8; Psa. 5:1-12; Psa.\n126:2; Psa. 127:1; Psa. 128:5-6; Psa. 129:1-2.\n\nPsa. 148:1-4.-“Praise” is seven times repeated at the beginning of\nsuccessive sentences. So also in the whole of Psa. 150:1-6\nIsa. 51:1; Isa. 51:4; Isa. 51:7.-Three times we have the Divine call\n“Hearken unto me.”\nJer. 1:18.-“Behold, | have made thee this day a defenced city,\n\nand an iron pillar,\n\nand brazen walls-\n\nagainst the whole land,\n\nagainst the kings of Judah,\n\nagainst the princes thereof,\nagainst the priests thereof, and\nagainst the people of the land.”\n\nThe figure, here, emphasizes the fact that the prophet in being\nGod’s spokesman was recognised as the “man of God,”* [Note: See\nThe Man of God, by the same author and publisher; price one penny.]\nbut also (and therefore) as necessarily “against” man. For, inasmuch\nas man’s thoughts and man’s ways are always the opposite of 6ος,\nhe who is for God cannot help being opposed to man.\n\nJer. 4:23-26.-We have “I beheld” four times repeated; to enchance\nthe solemnity of the desolation of Jehovah’s judgments.\n\nJer. 5:17.-“They shall eat up” is three times repeated; to emphasize\nthe complete devouring of the land by the enemy.\n\nJer. 50:35-36.-“A sword” is four times repeated; to emphasize the\nslaughter in the destruction of Babylon.\n\nJer. 51:20-23.-Ten times we have the words “with thee” repeated to\namplify the statement in verse 20. “Thou art my battle ax,” spoken of\nIsrael.\n\nHos. 3:4.-“For the children of Israel shall abide many days\nwithout a king,\nand without a prince,\nand without a sacrifice,\nand without an image,\nand without an ephod,\nand without teraphim.”\nHere there is something more than a simple Polysyndeton (q.v.\n[Note: Which see.] ), as another word is joined with the conjunction.\nThe employment of this figure emphasizes the present desolation\nof Israel.\nMic. 5:9-13.-“I will cut off’ is repeated four times; to amplify and\nextend the prophecy in verse 9.\nMic. 7:11-12.-Here we have “In that day” repeated to emphasize the\ntime; and “from” to amplify the places whence they shall come.\nZep. 1:2-3.-1 will consume,” three times repeated, indicates the\nsolemnity of the threatening and the certainty of its execution.\nMat. 5:3-11.-The word “Blessed” nine times repeated.\nMat. 5:22.-\n“Whosoever is angry, etc.\nWhosoever shall say, etc.”\nMat. 11:7-9.-“What went ye out ... to see?”\n\nThis question is three times repeated; to emphasize and call\n\nattention to the fact that, though they were all attracted to John, yet\nthey rejected him, and his ministry, and his testimony. See under\nErotesis.\nMat. 11:18-19.-This is lost in the English Version: as in the Greek the\nverb “came” is put out of its natural place (by the figure of Hyperbaton,\nq.v. [Note: Which see] ), and is made to commence the two\nsuccessive sentences.\nIt is a very remarkable Anaphora.\nRom. 8:33-35.-Here we have the three questions, each beginning with\n“Who shall?” (See page 87).\nThe first two questions should be answered like the third.\n“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?\nShall God that justifieth?\nWho is he that condemneth?\nShall Christ that died, ...?\nWho shall separate us ...?\nShall tribulation? etc.”\n1Co. 3:9.-This, too, is hidden in the translation. In the Greek the figure\nis clearly seen.\n“God’s fellow-labourers we are:\nGod’s husbandry,\nGod’s building, ye are.”\n\nNote, that the fellow-labourers are ourselves with one another; and\nnot we who are fellow-labourers with God. We are not to dishonour\nGod by bringing Him down and making Him one of ourselves. The\npopular explanation is only another instance of man’s nature, which\nmade him so easy a prey to Satan’s temptation-promise, “Ye shall be\nas gods” (Gen. 3:5).\n\nHerein lies the difference between the First Adam and the Last,\nbetween the First man and the Second. The first man thought equality\nwith God was a thing to be grasped at: but the Second Man did not so\nconsider it (Php. 2:6, R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).\nEquality with God was not a thing to be obtained, but a thing to be\neither inherently possessed (as He possessed it as the Son of God),\nor to be received as the gift of God (as He received it as the Son of\nMan).\n1Co. 6:11.-“And such were some of you,\n\nbut ye are washed,\nbut ye are sanctified,\nbut ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the\nSpirit of our God.”\n1Co. 6:12.\n“All things [or rather meats] are lawful unto me, but\nAll things [to еай are not expedient:\nAll things [or meats] are lawful for me [fo eaf], but | will not be\nbrought under the power of any.”\nHere the figure is combined with another called Mesarchia (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).\n1Co. 11:3.-“But | would have you know that\nthe head of every man is Christ: and\nthe head of the woman is the man: and\nthe head of Christ is God.”\nWe have here Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), as well as\nan irregular Climax (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\n1Co. 12:8-11.-We have the repetition of the words, “to another.” In\nthe Greek the word is not exactly the same in each case. It is ἄλλος\n(allos), another (of the same kind), six times, and ἑτέρος (heteros),\nanother (of a different kind), twice, in connection with “faith” and\n“kinds of tongues.”* [Note: It is probable that Heteros marks a new\nclass; while Allos refers to subdivisions of the same class.]\n\n“To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom,\n\nto another (allos) the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.\n\nTo another (heteros) faith by the same Spirit;\n\nto another (al/os) the gifts of healing by the same Spirit.\nTo another (a//os) the working of miracles;\n\nto another (allos) prophecy;\n\nto another (al/os) discerning of spirits;\n\nto another (heteros) divers kinds of tongues;\n\nto another (al/os) the interpretation of tongues:\nbut all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to\nevery man severally AS HE WILL,” and not as we may will or “claim.”\n1Co. 13:4.-In the first three verses we have the figure of Polysyndeton\n(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), or “many ands.” In verses 4-7, we have a\ncombination of two figures:-Asyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), or\n“no-ands”; and Anaphora in the repetition of the word “Charity” (verse\n4).\n\nIn verse 7, the Greek order of the words is: Charity\n\n“all things beareth,\n\nall things believeth,\n\nall things hopeth,\nall things endureth.’\nIn verse 8:\n“Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail;\nwhether there be tongues, they shall cease;\nwhether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.”\nIn verse 9:\n“In part we know, and\nin part we prophesy.”\nIn verse 11. “When | was a child,\nas a child | spake,\nas a child | understood,\nas a child | thought.”\n2Co. 11:26.-Here we have the repetition of “in perils” eight times.\n2Co. 7:11.-We have the repetition of the word “yea” to increase the\neffects and results of true godly sorrow for sin in seven particulars.\nReferring to six different aspects of their sorrow as manifested in three\ndifferent directions.\n\nThe word rendered “yea” really means but; and it may be\npreserved by supplying the Ellipsis:-what carefulness (or rather\nearnestness) it wrought in you, but not earnestness merely-that is\nsaying too little-\n\nin respect of themselves.\n\nbut self-defence,\n\nbut indignation,\n\nin respect of Paul.\n\nbut fear,\n\nbut vehement desire,\n\nin respect of him who had done the wrong.\nbut zeal,\n\nbut revenge,\nThe first “but” combines the additional figure of Epitasis (q.v.\n[Note: Which see] ), which is here an emphatic addition to a\nstatement or argument of six particulars.\n\nEph. 6:12.-“For we wrestle not\nagainst flesh and blood, but\nagainst principalities,\nagainst powers,\nagainst the rulers of the darkness of this world,\nagainst spiritual wickedness in high places.”\n\nThis is to emphasize the fact that our conflict is spiritual, and that\nSatan’s sphere of operations is not immorality or crime, but religion.\nSee all the references to him in Scripture, and note how opposed they\nare to popular Satan-myth of the world and of Christendom.\n\nPhp. 3:2.-Note the repetition of the word “beware.”\nPhp. 4:2.-Ί beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche.”\nPhp. 4:8.-We have here the repetition of the word “whatsoever\nthings’ with which the figure of Asyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) is\ncombined, in order to emphasize the important conclusion “Think on\nthese things:” and these things, in eight nouns are arranged in the\nfigure of Chiasmus (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).\n1Jn. 1:1-3.-\n\n“That which was from the beginning,\n\nwhich we have heard,\n\nwhich we have seen with our eyes,\n\nwhich we have looked upon ...\n\nThat which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.”\n\nThis five-fold repetition of the pronoun 6 (ho), which, emphasizes\n\nwith great solemnity the subject of the epistle which is opened thus in\nso stately a manner.\nJam. 5:7-8.-Three times we have “Be patient” with reference to the\ncoming of the Lord.\nJam. 5:13-14.-Twice we have the question “Is any?”\n\n“Is any among you afflicted?\nLet him pray.\n\nIs any merry?\n\nLet him sing psalms.\n\nIs any sick among you?\nLet him call,” etc.\nHere are contrasted prayer and praise; and praying with singing.\nTeaching us that prayer is not to be sung.* [Note: See Intoned Prayers\nand Musical Services, by the same author and publisher.]\n1Jn. 3:5; 1Jn. 3:8.-“He was manifested to take away our sins; ... the\nSon of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the\ndevil.”\n\nHere the two great purposes of Christ\'s manifestation are\ndeclared: the one present, and the other future; the one in grace now,\nand the other in power hereafter; the one in sufferings, and the other\nin glory.\n\nOther examples of Anaphora may be seen in Gal. 1:8-9. Rev. 7:5-8\n(with Epistrophe), and elsewhere: for these examples are given only\nas specimens.',''),(19,19,'epanalepsis','Rom. 3:25-26.-“Whom God hath set forth fo be а propitiation through\nfaith in his blood, to declare [his righteousness for the remission of\nsins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, / say],\nat this time his righteousness:” etc.\n\n1Co. 4:11; 1Co. 4:13, where the words in verse 11, “unto this\npresent hour,” are taken up again at the end of verse 13, “unto thid\nday.”\n\n1Co. 10:25; 1Co. 10:29.-Here, after a parenthesis (verses 26-28) the\nword “conscience” is repeated from the end of verse 25, and the\nargument is resumed in verse 29.\n\nEph. 3:1; Eph. 3:14.-“For this cause I, Paul, [the prisoner of Jesus\nChrist.... (then after a parenthesis of thirteen verses he resumes in\nverse 14), For this cause] | bow my knees,” etc.\n\nPhp. 1:22; Php. 1:24.-In verse 20, the apostle had been speaking of\nglorifying God “by life, or by death.” For, if he lived, it would be\n“Christ,” and if he died, it would be “gain” to him, and would release\nhim and give him rest from all his labours. The real conclusion is that if\nhe continued to abide in the flesh it would be better for them. But this\nconclusion is interrupted by the mention, parenthetically, of a third\nthing, which made him unable to say which of the two (living or dying)\nhe would really prefer, because this third thing was so much better\nthan either of the other two; for it was-the return of Christ. Then,\nhaving mentioned this, he takes up the statement again, repeating the\nbeginning of verse 22 (“in the flesh”) and continuing it in verse 24.\nVerse 23:-“But if | live in the flesh, [this is the fruit of my labour\n(yet what | shall choose | wot not, for | am being pressed* [Note: —-\nsé, | am being pressed.] out oft [Note: & occurs 857 times, and is\nnever translated “betwixt” anywhere else, But it 165 times rendered\n“out of.”] these two, having a strong desire unto the return,$ [Note:\nThis is not the infinitive mood of the verb depart, but three distinct\nwords. οἱ (65), unto, 60 (to) the, ἀναλῦσαι (analusai), return.

Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together\nwith them in clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and SO (οὕτω, houtdp,\nthus, in this manner) shall we ever be with the Lord.” There, is\ntherefore, no other way of being with the Lord.” The Spirit of God\nwould not have written one thing to the Thessalonians and a different\nthing to the Philippians.',''),(20,20,'polysyndeton','One illustration of each will make this quite clear. We have an\nexample of both in one chapter (Luk. 14:1-35), and, strange to say, in\nconnection with precisely the same four words.\n\nIn verse 13, we have Asyndeton (no-ands): and in verse 21,\nPolysyndeton (many-ands).\n\nIn the former case (Asyndeton), we are not asked to consider the\nvarious classes of persons mentioned, but we are hastened on to the\nimportant and weighty conclusion:-\n\nVerse 13, 14. “When thou makest a feast, call the poor,\n-the maimed,\n\n-the lame,\n\n-the blind:\n\nand thou shalt be blessed.”\n\nIn other words, we are taught that, though we are not obliged to\nmake a feast at all, yet, even if we do, we can call whom we please:\nbut, if we call such persons as are here described, there is a great\nblessing attached: hence, we are hurried over the enumeration of\nthese classes to be told of this blessing. And, even then, it really does\nnot matter much whether they are actually blind or lame, etc. The\npoint is they must not be able to return it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Master’s servant is commanded to “bring\nin” such persons to the Lord’s feast, as a matter of simple obedience:\nand when he has done this, he has done no more than his duty, and is\nat the best, but an “unprofitable servant.” Hence, by the use of this\nfigure of Polysyndeton in verse 21, we are not hurried on to any climax\nat the end, but we are detained at each step, and are thus asked to\nconsider carefully what is taught Us by the mention of each of these\nvarious classes:-\n\n“Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,\nand bring in hither the poor (i.e., those whom no one would think of\ninviting, but who would welcome the invitation (15:1. Mat.\n\n20:31):-“the poor” who could not afford to buy “a piece of ground”\n\n(verse 18), or “five yoke of oxen” (verse 19).\nand the maimed (i.e., those who would be most unlikely to be able to\n\nsay, “| have married a wife” (verse 20),\nand the halt (χωλούς, as in verse 13, where it is translated “lame”: {6.,\n\nthose who could not “go” to use the oxen, or to “prove them,” at\n\nthe plough, verse 19),\nand the blind (i.e., those who could not say, “I must needs go and see”\n\nthe piece of land which | have bought, verse 18).\n\nHere, by this figure, instead of being hurried forward to a weighty\nconclusion we are led gently backward by each “and” to think of these\nfour classes, and to contrast them with those whom the Lord had just\ndescribed in the preceding parable as making excuses.\n\nThese two illustrations will prepare us for the consideration of the\ntwo figures separately, and enable us to understand them.\n\nWe consider here only the illustrations of Polysyndeton. The\nexamples of Asyndeton will be found under that figure (pages\n137-148), which being Elliptical, i.e., characterised by the omission of\nthe word “and” has been placed under the First Division, Figures of\nOmission.\n\nGen. 8:22.-Here the completeness of the covenant and the fulness of\nthe blessing, and the certainty of the Divine promise, is set forth in a\ndouble four-fold description:-\n“While the earth remaineth,\n\nseedtime and harvest,\n\nand cold and heat,\n\nand summer and winter,\n\nand day and night, shall not cease.”\n\nGen. 19:12.-“And the men said unto Lot\n\nHast thou here any beside?\n\nson-in-law,\n\nand thy sons,\n\nand thy daughters,\n\nand whatsoever thou hast in the city, and bring them out of this place.”\nSee also verses 16, 19; and verse 17 for Asyndeton.\n\nGen. 22:9; Gen. 22:11.-The solemnity and deliberation of Abraham’s\n\nactions is emphasised, and each is marked off from the other by this\n\nfigure:-\nand they came to the place which God had told him of;\nand Abraham built an altar there,\n\nand laid the wood in order,\n\nand bound Isaac his son,\n\nand laid him on the altar upon the wood:\n\nand Abraham stretched forth his hand:\n\nand took the knife to slay his son:\n\nand the angel of the Lord,” etc.\n\nGen. 25:34.-“Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles;\nand he did eat\n\nand drink,\n\nand rose up,\n\nand went his way:\n\nAnd Esau despised his birthright.”\nHere our attention is drawn to the deliberateness of Esau’s action.\nThere is no haste in the words, as there was none in Esau’s deed.\nEach part of it is minutely pointed out, and dwelt upon, as showing\nthat Esau did not fall under some sudden temptation, but that he\ndeliberately and wilfully “despised his birthright.” (See Heb. 12:16-17.)\nGen. 43:8.-This is shown more clearly in the Hebrew; it is partly\nhidden in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] ‚ to suit the English idiom. Here, the\nPolysyndeton is used to heighten the effect of Judah’s appeal to his\nfather to let them all depart and procure the food they so greatly\nneeded. The Hebrew reads:-\n\n“And Judah said unto Israel, his father, Send the lad with me,\nand we will get up,\n\nand we will go,\n\nand we shall live,\n\nand so we shall not die;\n\nalso we,\nalso thou,\nalso our households.”\nExo. 1:7.-Here the figure is employed in order to impress us with the\nmarvellous increase of Israel by the Divine blessing (See Psa. 105:24;\nPsa. 107:33).\n“and the children of Israel were fruitful,\nand increased abundantly,\nand multiplied,\nand waxed exceeding great,\nand the land was filled with them.”\nJos. 7:11.-Jehovah shows to Joshua (and to us) the greatness of\nAchan’s sin, by bringing out emphatically all the acts which formed\npart of it. The Hebrew reads:-\n“Israel hath sinned,\nand they have also transgressed my covenant, which | commanded\nthem;\nand (Ap, vegam, they have also taken of the accursed thing,\nand have also stolen,\nand have dissembled also,\nand they have also put it among their own stuff.”\nFive times we have ial (vegam), and also, in this verse.\nJos. 7:24.-Here, to show the awful solemnity of the judgment\nexecuted upon Achan, and the magnitude of his sin, twelve times we\nhave the conjunction, eleven of the times with ru (πα.\n“And Joshua,\nand all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,\nand the silver,\nand the garment,\nand the wedge of gold,\nand his sons,\nand his daughters,\nand his oxen,\nand his asses,\nand his sheep,\nand his tent,\nand all that he had:\nand they brought them unto the valley of Achor.”\n1Sa. 17:34-36.-Here David enhances the importance of what he tells\nKing Saul, by bringing out graphically each detail of that which makes\nhim a type of the Good Shepherd:-\n“And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep\nand there came a lion\nand a bear,\nand took a lamb out of the flock:\nand | went out after him\n\nand smote him,\n\nand delivered it out of his mouth:\n\nand when he arose against me, | caught him by his beard,\nand smote him,\n\nand slew him. Thy servant slew\n\nboth (Al) the lion,\nand (al) the bear.\n\nand this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, etc.”\n\n2Ki. 2:12; 2Ki. 2:14.-“And he took hold of his own clothes,\n\nand rent them in two pieces:\n\nand he took up (he took up also) the mantle of Elijah that fell from him,\n\nand went back,\n\nand stood by the bank of Jordan;\n\nand he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him,\n\nand smote the waters,\n\nand said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?\n\nand when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and\nthither,\n\nand Elisha went over.”\nAll this to show us the importance, not of any great climax, but of\neach part of that wondrous miracle.\n2Ki. 5:26.-In the words of Elisha to Gehazi on his return from\nNaaman, he brings out by the use of this figure all that was in\nGehazi’s heart; showing that he knew how Gehazi had already\nplanned and arranged how he should spend and lay out the money\nwhich he had asked of Naaman.\n\n“Is it a time to receive money,\nand to receive garments,\nand oliveyards,\nand vineyards,\nand sheep,\nand oxen,\nand menservants,\nand maidservants?”\n1Ch. 29:11-13.-Here the greatness and the goodness of Jehovah is\nset forth in David’s Thanksgiving. The whole structure* [Note: For\nthese structures see under Correspondence below.] of this\nthanksgiving is as follows:-\nPraise.\nA а 10-. David blessing Jehovah\nЬ -10. Jehovah’s eternity.\nВ — 11. Jehovah’s greatness “above all.”\nВ 12. Jehovah\'s goodness “unto all.”\nA а 13. David blessing Jehovah,\nb 14, 15. David’s mortality.\nPrayer.\nC 16. The House and its provision,\nD 17. “I give” “mine heart.” (Time past and present).\nр 17-19. Prepare their heart to give. (Time to come).\n6 19. The house and its provision.\nThe figure occurs in B and B:-\n“Thine, O Lord, is the greatness (Psa. 145:3),\nand the power (verse 12 and Psa. 21:14),\nand the glory (beauty, verse 13. Psa. 96:6),\nand the victory (/ustre, 198. 15:29),\nand the majesty (Psa. 21:6); for all that is in the heaven\nand in the earth (is thine):* [Note: Or, omitting the italics “because of\nall in the heavens and in the earth.”]\nThine is the Kingdom, O Lord,\nand thou art exalted as head above all,\n(The figure is lost by saying “both riches and honour.)\nand the riches\nand the honour\ncome of thee,\nand thou reignest over all;\nand in thine hand is power\nand might;\nand in thine hand it is to make great,\nand to give strength unto all:\n\nand now, our God, (not “Now therefore”) we thank thee,\n\nand praise thy glorious name!”\n\nPsa. 107:35-37.-Here, to enhance the blessings which Jehovah\n\nbestows upon His people they are set forth with such distinctness that\n\nwe are asked to dwell upon each one that goes to make up the whole:\n“He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,\n\nand dry ground into watersprings,\n\nand there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city\nfor habitation;\n\nand sow the fields,\n\nand plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.”\n\nIsa. 2:11-19.-Here the figure is employed to set forth the\n\ncompleteness of the manner in which Jehovah will shake terribly the\n\nearth” (19, 21). There is another figure employed (see under\n\nSynonymia): and this, with the structure, shows us the importance and\n\nsolemnity of the whole passage. It commences with chap. 2, and ends\nwith chap. 4. Thus:-\nА 2:1-5. Promise.\nВ 2:6-22. Threatening of judgment (general).\nВ 3-4:1. Threatening of punishment (particular).\nА 4:2-6. Promise.\nThen these members may be expanded thus:-\nA. The Promise, 2:1-5.\nA С 2:1, 2. Zion, its exaltation. All people flowing unto it.\nр 3-. What they say: “Come ye, ... we will walk, etc.”\n©С -3, 4. Zion, its rule. The word going out from it.\nр — 5. What the people say: “Come ye, ... let us walk, etc.”\nThen the second member B, with which we have to do (the figure\nо Polysyndeton marking it and stamping it as a, whole), may be\nexpanded, thus:-\nB. Threatening of judgment (general), 2:6-22. (With special reference\nto men.)* [Note: In B (3-4:1) the reference is specially to women.\nIn A (4:2-6) the reference is:-\na 2. General.\nb 3. To men.\nb 4. To women.\na 6. General.]\nЕ Е 6-. Jehovah ceasing from His People.\n© -6-9. Reason. Because they exalt themselves before\nGod, and humble themselves before their idols.\nG 10-21. Judgment. The People humbled, and Jehovah\nalone exalted. Idols abolished.\nF 22. “Cease ye from man,” &c.\nOnce more, the member G may be expanded, thus:-\n©. The Judgment (2:10-21).\n©С Н1а 10-. Concealment. “Go to the rock,” etc.\nЬ -10. Reason: “For fear of the Lord,” etc.\nby Jehovah.\nJ с 11. Man abased. Jehovah exalted\n@ 12-16. High things brought low\nο. 17. Man abased. Jehovah exalted\nа — 18. Idols utterly abolished\nH2 а 19-. Concealment. “They shall go to the rocks,”\netc.\nЬ -19. Reason: “For fear of the Lord,” etc.\nJ 20-. Idols cast away by man.\nH3 а  21-. Concealment, “to go into the clefts of the\nrocks.”\nВ -21. Reason: “For fear of the Lord,” etc.\nWe may note in passing that in J we have Jehovah and Idols:\nwhile in J we have Man and his Idols.\nNow, we are prepared to see how the judgment executed by\nJehovah in J (verses 11-18) is further emphasized by the figure of\nPolysyndeton; as it is still further marked and emphasized by the\nfigure of Synonymia (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ):-\nMAN\nJ ο 11. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled,\nand the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,\nand the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.\nJehovah’s judgment оп GOD’S WORKS (seven members).\nd — 12-16. For the day of the Lord* [Note: This is the first\nmention of “the Day of the Lord.” For the significance of\nthis, see Number in Scripture by the same author and\npublisher.] of hosts shall be upon every one [or thing]\nthat is proud and lofty,\nand upon every one [thing] that is lifted up;\nand he shall be brought low:\nand upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and\nlifted up,\nand upon all the oaks of Bashan,\nand upon all the high mountains,\nand upon all the hills that are lifted up,\nJehovah\'s judgment on MAN’S WORKS (four).\nand upon every high tower,\nand upon every fenced wall,\nand upon all the ships of Tarshish,\nand upon all pleasant pictures.\nMAN.\nο 17. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,\nand the haughtiness of men shall be made low;\nand the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.\nJehovah\'s judgment on man’s works.\nа 18. And the Idols, he shall utterly abolish.\nIsa. 3:17-26; Isa. 4:1.-Here, we have, in these few verses, the “many\nands” marking the minuteness of the Lord’s judgment on the\ndaughters of Zion.\nThese verses form one member (B) of the larger structure (see\nabove), which may be expanded, as follows:-\nВ. 3-4:1. Threatening of judgment (Particular).\nВ е 3:1-7. Threatening. What Jehovah will “take away” from\nJerusalem and from Judah.\n# — 8-9-. Sin. Tongue, doings, countenance.\nе — -9-11. Threatening. “Woe, woe.”\n# 12. Sin. Weak and oppressive rulers (4, 4).\nε 13-15. Threatening. Jehovah will judge and rule.\n@ 16. Sin. Feminine haughtiness.\n\nп 17-4:1. Threatening. What Jehovah will “take away” from\nthe daughters of Zion.\nHere, in the last member η (3:17-4:1), we have twenty-six “ands,”\nwhich the reader can notice for himself.\nIsa. 37:37.-Here, to enhance the overthrow of Sennacherib’s army,\nand to show how completely Jerusalem was delivered from the siege\nwhich he made against it, we read:-\n“So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed,\nand went,\nand returned,\nand dwelt at Ninevah.”\nJer. 31:28.-Here the figure emphasises both the “scattering” and the\n“gathering” of Israel:-\n“And it shall come to pass, that, like as | have watched over them to\npluck up,\nand to break down,\nand to throw down,\nand to destroy,\nand to afflict; so will | watch over them, to build\n\nand to plant, saith the Lord.”\n\nHag. 1:11.-To enhance the description of the troubles which had fallen\nupon Israel, a nine-fold “and” is employed (nine being the number of\njudgment)* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author and\npublisher.] :-\n\n“And | called for a drought upon the land,\n\nand upon the mountains,\n\nand upon the corn,\n\nand upon the new wine,\n\nand upon the oil,\n\nand upon that which the ground bringeth forth,\n\nand upon men,\n\nand upon cattle,\n\nand upon all the labour of the hands.”\nMat. 7:25.-Неге the perfect security of the “wise man,” who hears the\nsayings of Jesus, and is likened unto a man who built his house upon\na rock, is emphasized by a five-fold “and” (five being the number of\ngrace).\n\n“And the rain descended (on the roof),\n\nand the floods came (at the foundations),\n\nand the winds blew (at the sides),\n\nand beat upon that house:\n\nand it fell not.”\n\nWhile, on the other hand, in verse 27, the insecurity of the “foolish\nman,” who hears, but does not, the sayings of Jesus, is set forth by a\nsix-fold “and” (six being the number of man and of human\nindependence and imperfection:-\n\n“And the rain descended,\nand the floods came,\nand the winds blew,\nand beat upon that house;\n\nand it fell:\n\nand great was the fall of it.”\n\nMat. 24:29-31.-Here, to emphasize the wondrous events of the day of\n\nthe Lord, and the order of them, the figure is used.\n“Immediately after the tribulation of those days\nThe sun shall be darkened,\n\nand the moon shall not give her light,\n\nand the stars shall fall from heaven,\n\nand the powers* [Note: See under Catachreesis.] of the heavens\nshall be shaken,\n\nand then shall appear the sign of the Son of Mant [Note: See under\nIdiom and Synecdoche.] in heaven:\n\nand then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,\n\nand they shall see the Son of Mant [Note: See under Idiom and\nSynecdoche.] coming in the clouds of heaven with power and +\n\n[Note: See under Hendiadys.] great glory.\nand he shall send his angels with a trumpet and + [Note: See under\n\nHendiadys.] a great sound (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ),\nand they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,* [Note:\n\nSee under Metonomy (of the adjunct).] from one end of heaven to\n\nthe other.”\n\nThis important passage describes the events which shall succeed\n“immediately after” the great tribulation (which was the subject of Old\nTestament prophecy. See Psa. 9:9; Psa. 10:1. Jer. 30:7. Joe. 2:11;\nJoe. 2:31. Amo. 5:18. Zep. 1:14, etc. Rev. 6:17): so that there is,\ntherefore, no interval for a millennium of peace and blessedness\nbefore the coming of the Lord.\nThis is the coming of the Lord with His saints (the Church), not His\ncoming for what will already have previously taken place before the\nGreat Tribulation begins. The Second coming corresponds with the\nFirst Coming (so-called) in that the first part of it answers to His\n“coming forth” at Bethlehem (Mic. 5:1-15 ii.), and the second part\nanswers to the “cometh unto” at Jerusalem (Zec. 9:9), the latter being\nreferred to in 2Th. 2:2, Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , and\nthe former revealed in 1Th. 4:16-17.\n\nConsequently his title, “The Son of Man,” agrees with the scope of\nthe passage; which has to do with dominion on the earth. While the\nelect can only be the elect of Israel (see Deu. 30:4 (Ixx.) Zec. 2:6,\netc.).\n\nMar. 3:31-35.-Here each part of the instructive scene is emphasized\nto attract our attention:-\n\n“There came then his brethren,\nand his mother,\nand standing without, sent unto him, calling him:\nand the multitude sat about him,\nand they said unto him, Behold thy mother\n\nand thy brethren without seek for thee:\n\nand he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?\n\nand he looked round about on them which sat about him,\n\nand said, Behold my mother,\n\nand my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is\nmy brother,\n\nand my sister,\n\nand mother.”\n\nThe scene which is thus emphasized is connected with verse 21\nas appears from the structuret [Note: For what is meant by Structure\nsee below under Correspondence.] of this whole passage.\n\nMar. 3:21-35.\nA а 21-. Jesus’s kindred (margin),\nЬ — -21-. Their interference with him.\nο -2Ί. Their disparagement of him.\nВ @а 22-. The Scribes’ first charge: “He hath\n\na devil.”\n\ne -22. The Scribes’ second charge: “By\nthe prince of the devil scasteth he out\ndevils.”\n\nB е 23-27. His answer to the second\ncharge.\nа 28,29. His denunciation of the first charge.\n\nA а 31-. Jesus’s kindred,\n\nЬ -31, 32. Their interference with Him,\nο 33-35. His disparagement of them.\n\nFrom this structure we learn that (1) the object of the visit, is\n\nexplained in verses 21-31, and that (2) the reference of verse 28 is to\nthe first charge of the Scribes-explaining what is called “the\nunpardonable sin”: and (3) that the “kindred” of verse 31 included his\nmother in the design and conspiracy.\nLuk. 1:31-32.-Here the birth of the Lord Jesus is presented as it is in\nIsa. 9:6-7, with the “sufferings” overleaped, and the present season of\nHis rejection not noticed. Our attention is called to all the wondrous\ndetails and separate parts of His glory, which, though thus linked\ntogether and connected with His birth, are not immediately\nconsecutive.\n“And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,\nand bring forth a son,\nand shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great,\nand shall be called the Son of the Highest:\nand the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\nand he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever;\nand of his kingdom there shall be no end.”\n\nIt is Mat. 1:21; Mat. 1:23, which refers to Isa. 7:1-25, and thus\nconnects the King with the “sufferings”: while it is Luke, which refers to\nIsa. 9:1-21, and thus connects “the Man” with the glory that shall\nfollow.t [Note: See below under Rev. 12:1-17]\n\nLuk. 7:11-18.-Here, there is no climax, but we are asked to stop and\ndwell upon each additional circumstance, and see why it is mentioned,\nand what is its peculiar lesson for us:-\n\nAnd it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain:\nand many of his disciples went with him,\nand much people. Now, when he came nigh to the gate of the city,\nbehold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his\nmother,\n\nand she was a widow:\n\nand much people of the city was with her:\n\nand when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her,\n\nand said unto her, Weep not.\n\nand he came\n\nand touched the bier:\n\nand they that bare him stood still.\n\nand he said, Young man, | say unto thee, Arise.\n\nand he that was dead sat up,\n\nand began to speak;\n\nand he delivered him to his mother;\nand there came a fear on all:\n\nand they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among\nus;\n\nand, That God hath visited his people,\n\nand this rumour of him went forth throughout all JudZa,\n\nand throughout all the region round about;\n\nand the disciples of John showed him of all these things.”\n\nHere in these eight verses we have no less than twenty “ands,”\neach introducing a fact and a statement for our earnest consideration;\neach fraught with truth and teaching. The last, for example, is the\nreason why John sent his disciples to Jesus. This reason is not given\nin Mat. 11:2 : which is thus explained. John was languishing in prison;\nand, when he heard that Jesus was raising the dead, he naturally\nwondered, if Jesus were “He that should come,” why he should be\nsuffering in prison.\n\nSee also Mar. 3:1-6, the miracle of the man with the withered\nhand.\nLuk. 7:38.-Here the woman\'s devotion to the Lord is set forth in a\ngracious five-fold enumeration of the parts of which it was made up:-\n“And stood at his feet behind him weeping,\nand began to wash his feet with tears,\nand did wipe them with the hairs of her head,\nand kissed his feet,\nand anointed them with the ointment.”\nFive “ands” in one verse!\nLuk. 10:27.-Here a five-fold description is given in order to set forth\nthat love which is “the fulfilling of the Law’:-\n“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\nand with all thy soul,\nand with all thy strength,\nand with all thy mind:\nand thy neighbour as thyself.”\n\nIt is sometimes said that we are never commanded to do that\nwhich is impossible. But the truth is, the Law is given, and the\nperfection of this command is thus emphasized, in order to reveal and\nbring to light our own impotence, that we may thankfully cast\nourselves on God’s omnipotence in that Saviour whom He has\nprovided and anointed.\n\nLuk. 12:45-46.-Here, the sin of the wicked servant, who said, “My lord\ndelayeth his coming,” is set forth in a fourfold description:-\n\n“And shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,\n\nand to eat\n\nand drink,\n\nand to be drunken.”\n\nLikewise his punishment is described in a fourfold manner:-\n\n“The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for\nhim,\nand at an hour when he is not aware,\nand will cut him in sunder,\nand will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.”\n\nWhat a solemn fact it is that those who put off the hope of the\nLord’s Coming till after the Tribulation are the ones who “smite” their\nfellow-servants; and this merely because they hope to be taken away\nbefore it comes!\n\nLuk. 15:20.-Here, five particulars give the fulness of Divine grace in\nreceiving the lost sinner:-\n\n“When he was yet a great way off,\nhis father saw him (eyes),\nand had compassion (heart),\nand ran (feet),\nand fell on his neck (arms),\nand kissed him’ (lips).\nThere is no climax; but we are asked to dwell separately on these\nfive aspects of grace, five (4 + 1) being the number which is\nsymbolical of grace.* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same\nauthor and publisher.]\nLuk. 15:22-23.-Here, we have an eight-fold enumeration of the gifts:\nshowing the completeness of the blessings poured upon accepted\none:-\n\n“The father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe (but do\nmore than that);\nand put it on him;\nand put a ring on his hand,\nand shoes on his feet:\nand bring hither the fatted calf,\nand kill it;\nand let us eat\nand be merry.”\nJoh. 10:27-28.-The riches of the grace bestowed upon the Lord’s\npeople are thus enumerated and emphasized by the five-fold\nPolysyndeton:-\n\n“My sheep hear my voice,\nand | know them,\nand they follow me;\nand | give unto them eternal life;\nand they shall never* [Note: See under Repeated Negation.] perish,\nand not anyone shall pluck them out of my hand” (so Greek).\nAct. 1:8.-“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is\ncome upon you:\nand ye shall be witnesses unto me\nboth in Jerusalem,\nand in all Judea,\nand in Samaria,\nand unto the uttermost part of the earth.”\nThus is emphasized for us the fact that there is one message, for\nall places and for all times. “Preach the Gospel to every creature.” Not\n“adapt the Gospel to every century.”\nThere are, here, three concentric circles. (1) The innermost\n“Jerusalem and in all Judea,” the place of Religiousness where they\nprofessed to worship God and to read His word. (2) “And in Samaria”\nwhich was the place of corrupt religion, for it is written of Samaria,\n“they feared the Lord, and served their own gods” (2Ki. 17:33). (3)\n“And unto the uttermost part of the earth,” which was the place of no\nreligion.\n\nThe witness for each was to be, not concerning Doctrines or\n\nSacraments, or Rites and Ceremonies; but, concerning a PERSON!\n“Ye shall be witnesses unto МЕ”-а crucified, risen, and coming\nSaviour. This is to be the witness: and this is the Gospel.\nRom. 8:29-30.-Here there is no climax or conclusion, but each great\nfact is to be weighed and duly considered. We emend the A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nonly by putting the word “also” in the correct place* [Note: See a\npamphlet, entitled, Also: a Bible-Study on the use of the Word, by the\nsame author and publisher.]\n\n“For whom he did foreknow, he did predestinate also ..\n\nMoreover whom he did predestinate, them he called also:\nand whom he called, them he justified also:\nand whom he justified, them he glorified also.”\nRom. 9:4.-Неге the figure is used to impress us with the wonderful\npossessions and privileges of Israel,\n“Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption (νίοθες ia\nsonship, Deu. 4:7; Deu. 4:33-34),\nand the glory (1Sa. 4:21),\nand the covenants (which precede the Law, Gal. 3:17),\nand the giving of the Law,\nand the service of God (ἡ λατρεία, hee /atreia, the [tabernacle]\nworship),\nand the promises.”\n1Co. 1:30.-“But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made\nunto us wisdom,\nand righteousness,\nand sanctification,\nand redemption.”\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] rendering does not\nalter the fact that these four wondrous things are distinctly separated,\nso that we are to study them, each one by itself, and to learn the\nweighty lessons and the equal importance of each. It is Christ Jesus\nwho is our righteousness; and He is equally our sanctification, and in\nHim we are perfect and complete as to our standing before God; and\nin Him we now wait for Resurrection: i.e., the redemption of our bodies\nfrom the power of the grave (Rom. 8:23. Eph. 4:30).\n\nEph. 4:31.-“Let all bitterness (πικρία, pikria, the opposite of χρηστοί,\nchreestoi, verse 32, kind).\nand wrath (θυμός, thumos, the opposite of εὔσπλαγχνοι,\neusplangchnoi tender-hearted),\n\nand anger (ὀργή, orgee, the opposite of χαριζόµενοι, charizomenoi,\nforgiving),\n\nand clamour,\n\nand evil-speaking be put away from you with all malice.”\n\nHere there is no climax; but in the next verse we have the opposite\nfigure of Asyndeton, in which there are no “ands,” because there is a\nweighty conclusion at the end, to which we are hastened on.\n\n* [Note: There is an “and” here in the A.V., but the Greek is -5\n\n(de), but. This is omitted by Lachmann, and put in the margin\n\nby Tregelles, Westcott and Hort.] “Be ye kind (χρηστοί,\n\nchreestoi, the opposite of πικρία, pikria bitterness, verse 31),\n-tender-hearted (εὔσπλαγχνοι, eusplangchnoi, the opposite of θυμός,\nthumos, wrath),\n\n-forgiving one another (χαριζόµενοι, charizomenoi, the opposite of\nopyn, orgee, anger),\neven as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”’t [Note:\nLachmann has Ucis (humin), us, which is put in the margin by Tr. WH.\nапа R.V.]\n\nPhp. 3:3.-“For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the\nspirit,\n\nand rejoice in Christ Jesus,\n\nand have no confidence in the flesh.”\n\nThus the Spirit emphasises these three great fundamental\nprinciples of Christianity, and asks us to dwell upon each, noting the\nnecessity of making all our worship wholly spiritual (Joh. 4:23-24);\nmaking the Lord Jesus the source of all our joy; and renouncing all\nattempts to work out a righteousness of our own.\n1Th. 2:11.-“Ye know how we exhorted\nand comforted\nand charged every one of you, as a father doth his children.” (See\n\nunder Ellipsis, page 89).\n1Ti. 1:5.-Here, the figure points us to the true genealogy of charity, or\nlove.\n“Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,\nand of a good conscience,\nand of faith unfeigned.”\n\nIf the faith be not right and unfeigned, then the “conscience”\ncannot be “good.” Conscience is the result of faith. It will condemn us\nin the doing of what we believe to be wrong. It will approve the doing\nof what we believe to be right. Hence, the importance of a true “faith.”\n\nIf the conscience be not “good,” the heart cannot be pure; and if\nthe heart be not pure, there can be no true, divine love.\n2Ti. 4:17-18.-Contrast this passage with the example of Asyndeton in\n2Ti. 3:10-11. In that passage we are not detained over the manner of\nthe Lord’s deliverance, but pointed to the great fact that He did deliver\nout of all. But here we have no such climax, and are asked to stop and\nconsider each part of the wondrous deliverance.\n\n“Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me,\nand strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known,\nand that all the Gentiles might hear:\nand | was delivered* [Note: See under the figures of Ellipsis and\nPolyptoton.] out of the mouth of the lion.\n\nand the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work,\n\nand will preserve met [Note: See under the figure of Paregmenon.]\nunto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever.\nAmen.”\n\nHeb. 13:8.-“Jesus Christ the same yesterday,\n\nand to-day,\n\nand for ever.”\n\nJam. 1:24.-Here the repeated “and” greatly emphasises what Bengel\n\ncalls the “hastiness joined with levity” of the natural man.\n“For he beholdeth himself,\n\nand goeth his way,\n\nand straightway forgeteth what manner of man he was.”\n\nJam. 4:13.-The Polysyndeton here, Bengel says, expresses the\n\ncaprice of a mind secure and indifferent-the will of a mind at ease.\n“Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a\ncity,\nand continue there a year,\nand buy\nand sell,\nand get gain.”\n2Pe. 1:5-7.-Here the sevenfold “and” points to all that is included in\n\nand follows the greatest gift of God (verse 3). Faith itself is God\'s gift\n\n(Eph. 2:8), and therefore it is not added to anything. It is the “precious\n\nfaith” which is “obtained” through the righteousness of God (verse 1).\n“And besides this (καὶ αὐτό τοῦτο, kai auto touto, and for this\nvery reason: i.e., because we have “precious faith” (verse 1),\nand are “partakers of the Divine nature” (verse 4), giving all\ndiligence (see verse 15 and 3:14), add to your faith, virtue (τὴν\nἀρετήν, teen areteen, courage);\n\nand to virtue, knowledge;\n\nand to knowledge, temperance (ἐγκράτεια, engkrateia, self-control,\nwhich is the fruit of knowledge. It means having self well reined in,\nthe government of а// the passions of the flesh);\n\nand to temperance, patience (under afflictions or the sufferance of\nevil, as courage is used in encountering and averting evil);\n\nand to patience, godliness (which is the only foundation of true\npatience or endurance. Apart from godliness it is stoicism, or mere\nindifference),\n\nand to godliness, brotherly kindness (the love of your Christian\nbrethren);\nand to brotherly kindness, charity” (the love of all). (1Pe. 1:22).\n\nThus “faith” is the source out of which all virtues must spring, and\n“love” is the point to which all such virtues tend. Hence, “Whatsoever\nis not of faith is sin’ (Rom. 14:23), and “the end of the commandment\nis love” (1Ti. 1:5).\n\nAnother important figure is combined here with Polysyndeton (see\nunder Climax (which is repeated Anadiplosis).\n\nRev. 1:11.-Here the seven churches are to be separated as being\nequal in importance, and distinct in their position:-\n\n“What thou seest write in a book\nand send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus,\nand unto Smyrna,\nand unto Pergamos,\nand unto Thyatira,\nand unto Sardis,\nand unto Philadelphia,\nand unto Laodicea.”\nRev. 3:17.-Here, the figure is used to bring out the Laodicean\ncondition of soul.\n“Because thou sayest, | am rich\nand increased with goods,\nand have need of nothing;\nand knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable,\nand poor,\nand blind,\nand naked.”\nRev. 6:15.-Here, to show the universality of the fear which will be\nmanifested when “the great day of his wrath is come”-all classes of\nsociety are named and stated with all formality in order to impress our\nminds:-\n\nand the kings of the earth,\n\nand the great men,\n\nand the rich men,\n\nand the chief captains,\n\nand the mighty men,\n\nand every bondmen,\n\nand every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of\nthe mountains.”\n\nRev. 12:1-17 -This chapter is rendered remarkable by the figure of\n\nPolysyndeton. Forty-four times the word “and” is repeated, bringing\n\nbefore us a variety of details connected with matters which are thus\n\nshown to be of the greatest possible importance. In chap. 5, we have\n\nthe book written “within and without” (ἔσωθεν καὶ ὄπισθεν, esqbthen\n\nkai opisthen), pointing to its esoteric (or inner) and exoteric (or outer)\n\nmeaning. What follows in chaps, 6-11, describes the exoteric or\n\noutside manifestations-events which will be seen by all; for chap. 11\n\ncarries us right on to the end, to the sounding of the “seventh” or last\ntrumpet, and thus covers the whole ground, even_ including\nResurrection and Judgment, and the setting up of the kingdom of the\nMessiah. See 11:15-18, which is coterminous with Rev. 20:1-15.\nChapter 12 does not, therefore, go forward, but takes us back to\nthe time, even before chap. 5, and gives us the esoteric or inner\nmeaning, and reveals to us the sources, springs, and secrets of all\nthat leads up to the judgments recorded in chaps, 6-11 Chapters\n13-14 introduce supplementary information which must be read into\nthose earlier preceding chapters (6-11), showing the part that the\nDragon and his agent the Antichrist will have in them.\n\nChapter 12 is constructed as follows:.-\n\nRev. 12:1-17\nA а — 1-5. The woman, the dragon, and the child.\nЬ 6. The woman’s flight, and its duration (1,260 days).\nВ 7-13. War in heaven (ἐγένετο, came to pass).\nA Ь — 14. The woman’s flight and its duration three years\nand a half\nа 15, 16. The woman, the dragon, and the rest of her seed.\nB17. War on earth.\n\nEach of these members can, of course, be expanded.

Reason. “For the devil is come down,” etc.\nThe woman and her seed and the dragon takes us back to Gen.\n3:1-24, where we see the “enmity” placed between them. Thence we\nare taken to the woman (Israel), through whom the child was to come,\nas seen in the call of Abraham, and in the establishment of “Israel,”\nand his twelve sons, of which the twelve stars (the Zodiacal signs*\n[Note: Just as the seven stars in chap. 1 are the symbols of the\nChurches.] ) were the symbols. (See Gen. 37:1-36).\nThe Zodiac is a certain zone of the heavens extending about 9°\neach side of the Ecliptic. This is divided into twelve parts, each of\nwhich has its own peculiar “sign.” The word “Zodiac” is not to be\nderived from Caw, or ζήν, to live, or ζώδιον, a little animal (for not all\nthe signs are animals), but from a more ancient root through the\nHebrew ona, to go, to go by steps, to step, to move slowly in a\nregular and stately manner. (See 2Sa. 6:13. Jer. 10:5. Jdg. 5:4. Psa.\n68:8. Hab. 3:12). The noun means a step. So that the Zodiac is\nliterally а way with steps. Its later Biblical name is Mazzaroth olaivyy\nJob. 38:32 (see margin); or Mazzaloth (ΠξΙά), 2Ki. 23:5 (see margin),\nfrom the root réé (azal), to go or revolve, divided, as the Zodiac is\ndivided into signs. Gesenius points out that the Mazzaroth (from τοῦ\nhas another sense, and means to admonish, premonish, presage. See\nGen. 37:9-10, where in Joseph’s prophetic dream he sees the whole\nfamily represented as “The sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars,”\n(himself being the twelfth.* [Note: Ancient Jewish authorities hold that\nthese twelve stars were the signs of the Zodiac. This is, without doubt,\nthe case. These “stars” have been well called “signs,” for in them is\nwritten in the very heavens the history of redemption. Each of the\nsymbolical figures is pictured performing some typical action. From the\nearliest times, also, one was appropriated to each of the twelve sonsof\nJacob. Josephus informs us that the tribes carried these signs on the\ntribal standards. The Chaldee paraphrase, of a still earlier date, says\nthe same. The Targums also add their testimony. As the order of\nencampment is described in Num. 1:1-54 and Π., the four tribes:\nJudah, Ephraim, Dan and Reuben are equidistant. The sign of Judah\nwas “Leo,” the lion; Ephraim’s was “Taurus,” the bull; Dan’s was\n“Scorpio,” the scorpion (afterwards changed to the “Aquila,” the\neagle); and Reuben’s was “Aquarius,” the man. These four signs are\nat the four cardinal points of the Zodiac, exactly corresponding with\nthe position of the four tribes. It is interesting to note that the sign now\nknown as “Libra,” or, the scales, is not found in the more ancient\nZodiacs, its place being occupied by “Ara,” the altar, the top of which\nthe sign or hieroglyphic much more resembles. The idea contained in\nLibra, the scales, or Justice, is the altar on which justice was satisfied.\nLibra or Ara was not borne on any of the standards, Simeon and Levi\nbeing included under one (Pisces). Hence the place of Libra, or rather\nof Ara, the altar, was the place occupied by the Tabernacle, and by the\naltar of burnt offering itself. It is remarkable that the three decans, or\nconstellations of Libra, or Ara, are the Cross, the Victim, and the\nCrown.\n\nThe evidence is altogether too overwhelming for us to take these\n“twelve stars” as representing anything but Israel. It is a “woman” that\nis seen, but her surroundings (of sun and moon, and the twelve signs\nof the Zodiac) show that she personifies emblematically the whole\nnation of Israel.\n\nSee The Witness of the Stars by the same author and publisher.]\n\nThe birth of the seed of this woman is set forth in the Old\nTestament in two distinct prophecies, showing its two-fold character,\none answering to “the sufferings of Christ’; the other, to “the glory that\nshould follow.”\n\nIn Isa. 7:14, we have the Incarnation of “Emmanuel-God with us”\n(Mat. 1:23).\n\nWhile, in Isa. 9:6-7, we have the birth presented, with the scene of\nhumiliation overleaped.\nThe former is the “suffering” aspect: the latter is the “glory” aspect\nof the birth of this Child.\n\nIt is remarkable that in Matthew-(the gospel of the kingdom)-we\nhave the suffering aspect from Isa. 7:14; while in Luke-the gospel of\nChrist as man-we have the glory aspect from Isa. 9:6-7. See and\ncompare Luk. 1:31-33.\n\nIn Rev. 7:5, it is this latter, or the glory aspect of Messiah’s birth\nthat is presented, as referred to in Psa. 2:1-12; Psa. 87:1-7 It leaps\nover the “sufferings of Christ,” and over the whole of the interval of this\npresent dispensation, and goes forward at once to the time when He\nshall reign over and rule all nations. “Who was to rule” (verse 5) is\nμέλλει (mellei), and means “who is to rule all nations.” It passes from\nthe birth of the man-child, and goes on at once to “the glory which\nshould follow, when the government shall be upon his shoulder.”\n\nIt is Christ Personal therefore, in the first instance, who is the\nsubject of this prophecy. He was the “man-child” “caught up to God\nand His throne.”\n\nBut this does not exhaust the prophecy. The word rendered “man-\nchild” in verse 5 is a peculiar word.* [Note: The masculine form, Gs\n(arseen), occurs only in Mat. 19:4. Mar. 10:6. Luk. 2:23. Gal. 3:28,\nwhere in each case the sex is emphatic.] The Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] renders it “a son, a man child.” Here it is,\naccording to all the critical texts (including the Revisers’ Text) and\nAncient MSS, ἄρσεν (arsen). Now ἄρσεν here is neuter, and therefore\ncannot possibly refer to any one individual. It cannot apply to either a\nman or a woman. The mother of this child is not an individual! but is\ncollective and composite. So also is the child.t¢ [Note: We have a\nsimilar example of a neuter word including both sexes in the word\nJ666J (gunaikaria), in 2Ti. 3:6, where it is rendered “silly women.”\nBut it occurs only here, and is neuter. It therefore includes silly women\nof both sexes!]\n\nSome see in this “man-child” the Church of God. But the Church is\nneither “woman” nor “child,” “neither male nor female” (Gal. 3:28). The\nChurch is “one new man” in Christ (Eph. 2:15). The Church was\nbefore creation, “before the foundation of the world” (Eph. 1:4), and is\nnot, therefore, the subject of prophecy, as is the kingdom and\ndominion in the earth, which was “from the foundation of the world”\n(Mat. 13:35; Mat. 25:34, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, we have such distinct prophecies in the Old\nTestament of this woman and her child that it surprising any should fail\nto connect them.\nA time is coming when a new nation is to be brought forth in Israel;\na nation bringing forth the fruits which Israel should have brought\nforth; the nation referred to in Mat. 21:43.\n\nConcerning that day Jehovah bids Zion to “sing” (Isa. 54:1-10).\n\nOf that day Jehovah has said, “Before she travailed, she brought\nforth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a MAN-CHILD. Who\nhath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth\nbe made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?\nfor as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her children” (Isa.\n66:5-14).\nAgain Mic. 4:9-10 distinctly foretells this travail of Zion; while chap.\n5:2, 3 connects together this composite man-child. In verse 3, we\nhave the birth of Him, who shall be “ruler in Israel.” His rejection by His\npeople is not named, but the consequent rejection of His people by\nHim both implies it and contains it; for, in the next verse, we read,\n“Therefore will He give them up, until the time that she which travaileth\nhath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto\nthe children of Israel. And He shall stand and rule (marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] ) in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the\nLord his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the\nends of the earth.”\n\nSurely, if there is any connection whatever between prophecy and\nits fulfilment, we have it in Rev. 12:1-17, where we see in this woman,\nZion, “travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered” (verse 2), and the\ndragon standing “before the woman which was ready to be delivered,\nfor to devour her child as soon as it was born.”\n\nThis was true of Messiah, and it will be true of the servant (the\ncomposite “child”), as the rest of the chapter goes on to explain.\n\nIt is this birth of a nation “in one day,” which will lead to the “war in\nheaven,”* [Note: See a small pamphlet, Things to Come, by the same\nauthor and publisher.] (see Dan. 10:20; Dan. 12:1), and lead to the\nDragon\'s being cast out into the earth. This will bring on the crisis\ndescribed in this chapter and chapter xiii. (See 2Th. 2:6, under\nEllipsis.\n\nThe chapter is too long to quote here in full, but if all the many\n\n“ands” be noted and marked, the importance of all these details will be\nat once noticed. See the next example.\nRev. 13:1-9.-Here the figure is used to mark, to emphasize, and to call\nour attention to the solemn events, which will follow upon Satan’s\nbeing cast out into the earth, to find no more place in heaven (12:8).\nForty-five times the word “and” is repeated in this chapter!\n\nRev. 12:1-17 is the key to the Apocalypse for the events recorded\nin it are Preliminary to the events recorded in the earlier part of the\nbook.\n\nFirst of all comes the taking up of the Body of Christ (12:5) which\ncauses the “war in heaven (12:7-12), and ends in the casting out of\nSatan. This is the great event which is the beginning of the end, and\nwhich ushers in the Apocalyptic scenes and judgments.* [Note: Chap.\n9:1, though coming before chap. 7., records a vision subsequent to it.\nJohn says, “I saw a star lying fallen ‘6uéU6J (pept - kota) from\nheaven. : not › а!, : а$ п А.М. В.М. has : fallen. \' ]\nConsequent on this follows a great persecution of Israel; which will\nbe to those who are left, the first exoteric or visible sign of the Devil’s\n“great wrath” (12:12). But this persecution will for a time be thwarted.\n“The earth” will “help the woman” (12:16). That is to say, the settled\nstate of the peoples of the earth will stop this persecution.\n\nThen the Dragon at once proceeds to organise his great rebellion.\nIn the Greek the twelfth chapter ends with the first sentence of chap.\nxiii: where, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , the true\nreading is-“And HE stood upon the sand of the sea.” The best Μ55.,\nwith Lachmann, Tregelles, Alford, and Westcott and Hort, read ἑστάθη\n(estathee), he stood, not ἑστάθην (estatheen), | stood.\nThat is to say, the settled state of “the earth” preventing the\ndestruction of Israel, the Dragon takes his post upon the sand of “the\nsea” and out of the waters and the earth (of the peoples) he calls up\nthe two Beasts of chap. 13.-his last two great instruments,-the\n“Antichrist” and the “False Prophet,”-by which he will seek to carry out\nhis purposes.\n\nJohn sees them “rising up.” The word is ἀναβαῖνον (anabainon,\npresent participle), rising or mounting up, not “rise up” as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “coming up.” John\nsees the first Beast “rising up out of the sea” (implying a gradual rather\nthan a sudden act): and the second Beast out of “the earth” (verse 11).\n\nAnd then he proceeds to describe their characters and their deeds.\nThe figure of Polysyndeton (a remarkable example) calls our attention\nto the many important details, each one of which is to be dwelt upon\nby us as being full of meaning and instruction:-\n\nAnd he stood upon the sand of the sea (i.e., the dragon, when cast\nout from heaven),\nand | saw a beast rising up out of the sea having seven heads,\nand ten horns,\n\nand upon his horns ten crowns,\n\nand upon his heads the names of blasphemy;\n\nand the beast which | saw was like a leopard (a combination of\nDaniel’s beasts in one, Dan. 7:1-28) (a leopard is Greece),\n\nand his feet were as the feet of a bear (Persia),\n\nand his mouth as the mouth of a lion (Babylon),\n\nand the dragon gave him his power (six times we have in this chapter\n“it was given him’),\n\nand his seat (or throne, 2:13; 16:10),\n\nand great authority (Luk. 4:6. 2Th. 2:9-10).\n\nand | saw one of his heads, as it were, wounded to death (similar to\nverses 6, 12, 14),\n\nand his deadly wound was healed;\n\nand all the world wondered [and followed] after the beast (3:10. 2Th.\n2:11-12),\n\nand they worshipped the dragon (this is the one great object, aim, and\nend of Satan, Mat. 4:9) which gave power unto the beast;\n\nand they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast?\nwho is able to make war with him? (Compare Exo. 15:3; Exo.\n15:11, for the blasphemy.)\n\nand there was given to him a mouth, speaking great things and\nblasphemies (2Th. 2:4),\n\nand authority was given him to continue forty and two months (Dan.\n7:25),\n\nand he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme\nhis name (Dan. 7:8; Dan. 7:11; Dan. 7:20; Dan. 7:25; Dan. 11:36.\nPsa. 52:1-9 : 2Th. 2:4),\n\nand his tabernacle (whither the saints have been previously taken),\n\nand them that dwell in heaven (i.e., the body of Christ which shall\nhave been caught up, when the accuser has been cast down).\n\nand it was given him to make war with the saints (Dan. 7:21; Dan.\n7:25; Dan. 11:40-44),\nand to overcome them (Dan. 8:12; Dan. 8:24; Dan. 11:28; Dan.\n11:30-33; Dan. 12:7):\n\nand power was given him (Joh. 19:11) over all kindreds,\n\nand tongues,\n\nand nations (as with Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 3:7);\n\nand all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him (2Th. 2:11-12),\nwhose names are not written in the book of life (Mat. 24:24. Dan.\n12:1. These are they who “overcome” him 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12,\n21; 12:11) of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If\nany man have an ear to hear, let him hear.”* [Note: See 2Th.\n2:1-17, under Ellipsis and Correspondence.]\nThis chapter contains two visions relating to two Beasts* [Note: See\n2Th. 2:1-17, under Ellipsis and Correspondence.] : the first, the\nAntichrist; the second, the “False Prophet.” The first is the false\nChrist, and the second is the false-and satanic counterfeit of the\nHoly Ghost. The second is marked, like the first, by the figure of\nPolysyndeton.\n\nThe structure of this chapter is very remarkable. In the Greek the\nfirst sentence forms the end of chap. 12. So we commence with the\nsecond “And | saw’”:-\n\nThe Vision of the Two Beasts (Rev. 13:1-18).\nΑ 1-. The vision (καὶ εἶδον), “And I saw.”\nB_-1-. The first Beast (Antichrist).\n6 -1-. His origin.

Each item is to be dwelt upon: there is no climax:-\n\n“The merchandise of gold,\nand silver,\nand precious stones,\nand of pearls,\n\nand fine linen (merchandise, not the gift of grace as with the Bride,\n19:8, “granted” to her: her righteous award),\n\nand purple,\n\nand silk,\n\nand scarlet,\n\nand all thyine wood,\n\nand all manner of vessels of ivory,\n\nand all manner of vessels of most precious wood,\n\nand of brass,\n\nand iron,\n\nand marble,\n\nand cinnamon (атотит, an Italian shrub of sweet odour),\n\nand odours,\nand ointments,\n\nand frankincense,\n\nand wine,\n\nand oil,\n\nand fine flour,\n\nand wheat,\n\nand beasts (of burden),\n\nand sheep,\n\nand horses,\n\nand chariots,\n\nand slaves,* [Note: (Greek «ΙΟ somata, bodies, was used by the\nFigure of Synecdoche as a term for slaves, as we use “hands” for\nlabourers.

Greek, παραδιαστολή, from παρά (para), beside\nor along, and στολή (stolee), a sending (from στέλλω (stello), to send).\nHence a sending beside or along. It is a form of Anaphora, by which\none word is repeated at the beginning of successive sentences. It\ndiffers from Polysyndeton, in that instead of a conjunction, the\nrepeated word is a disjunctive, because it denotes a sending along,\nie., it separates and distinguishes. The words NEITHER and NOR, ог\nEITHER and OR, are the words which are repeated in the figure of\nParadiastole, causing the various items to be put together disjunctively\ninstead of conjunctively.\n\nHence the Latins called it DISJUNCTIO, Disjunction.\n\nIts use is to call our attention to, and to emphasize, that which is\nthus written for our learning.\nExo. 34:4.-“The diseased have ye not strengthened,\nneither have ye healed that which was sick,\nneither have ye bound up that which was broken,\nneither have ye brought again that which was driven away,\nneither have ye sought that which was lost.”\nThus are the false shepherds indicted for their unfaithfulness and\nneglect.\nLuk. 18:29.-“And he said unto them, Verily | say unto you there is no\nman that hath left home,\nor parents,\nor brethren,\nor wife,\nor children, for the kingdom of God’s sake, who shall not receive\nmanifold more in this present time, and in the world to come, life\neverlasting.”\nJoh. 1:13.-“Which were born\nnot of blood,\nnor of the will of the flesh,\nnor of the will of man, but of God.”\nThus is emphasized the important doctrine that the new birth is\nentirely the work of the sovereign grace of God.\nRom. 8:35.-“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\nShall tribulation,\n\nor distress,\n\nor persecution,\n\nor famine,\n\nor nakedness,\n\nor peril,\n\nor sword?”\n\nThus is emphasized the blessed fact that our eternal security\ndepends not on human “perseverance,” but on Divine preservation, as\nthe Lord Jesus said “This is the FATHER’S WILL which hath sent me,\nthat of all which He hath given me | should lose nothing (Joh. 6:39).\n\nThis is followed up by the wondrous answer to the question\ninverses 38 and 39. “I am persuaded that\nneither death,\nnor life,\n\nnor angels,\n\nnor principalities,\n\nnor powers,\n\nnor things present,\n\nnor things to come,\n\nnor height,\n\nnor depth,\n\nnor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of\nGod, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n\n1Co. 3:21-22.-“All things are yours; whether Paul,\n\nor Apollos,\n\nor Cephas,\n\nor the world,\nor life,\nor death,\nor things present,\nor things to come;\nall are yours; and ye are Christ\'s; and Christ is God’s.\nThus the riches of the glory of our inheritance in Christ is revealed\nand set forth and displayed before our eyes.\n2Th. 2:2.-“That ye be\nnot quickly shaken from your mind,\nnor yet be troubled,\nneither by spirit,\nnor by word,\nnor by Epistle as from us as [though we had said] that the day of the\nLord has set in.”\nThus does the apostle emphasize his strong desire that nothing\nmight loosen them (as a ship is loosed from its moorings) from the\nblessed hope of “our gathering together unto Him” when He shall\n“come forth” into the air “for” His people, who then shall be “caught up\nto meet Him,” and thus be for ever with Him.\nThis he had taught them in the first epistle (4:13-18) for their\ncomfort, but now some person or persons must have deceived them\nby asserting that the apostle had said, or written to say, that “the Day\nof the Lord had set in.” If this were so, they might well be troubled, for\nhe was proved to have deceived them and to have given them a false\nhope, for they had not been “gathered” to Christ to meet Him in the air\nbefore the day of the Lord. So he writes ὑπέρ (hyper), on behalf of, or\nin the interest of that blessed hope, in order to thus assure them that\nhe had never said or written any such thing.\n\nNothing stands between the day of Christ and our ascension to\nmeet Him in the air. Many things stand between that event and our\ncoming “with” Him in “the Day of the Lord.” The teaching of Paul by\nthe Holy Ghost is very different from popular Christian teaching to-day.\nThe popular teaching is that that shall not come till the world’s\nconversion comes: the truth here stated is that it cannot come till the\napostacy shall have come!\n\nPopular teaching is that the world is not yet good enough! The\nfigure here points us to the fact that the world is not bad enough!\nThere yet lacks the coming of the Apostacy and of Antichrist.

[Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nΠ.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] The word is τὸ πνεῦμα (to\npneuma), the Spirit, which is used both at the beginning and the end\nof the passage in the original. But at the beginning it is translated “the\nwind,” and at the end “the Spirit.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] has “the Spirit breathed, etc.” in the margin.\n\nNow the word πνεῦμα (pneuma), spirit, occurs 385 times in the\nNew Testament, and is never translated “wind,” except in this one\nplace. There is a proper word for “wind,” which is ἄνεμος (anemos). It\noccurs 31 times, and is always translated wind. So that it would have\nbeen much clearer to have used this word, if “wind” had really been\nmeant.\n\nIf then we keep here the translation “spirit,” which is used\neverywhere else, the verse will read and the figure appear as follows:-\n\n“The Spirit breatheth where He willeth, and thou hearest His\nvoice, but thou knowest not whence He cometh or whither He goeth;\nso is every one that is born of the Spirit.”\n\nThe wind has no will, but the Spirit has a will and a voice, and it is\nof Him that we are born.\n\nThe verb θελεῖν (thelein), to will, occurs 213 times, and always\nexpresses a mental act of desire or determination proceeding from\none capable of wishing, willing, or determining. See the nearly\nsynonymous expression in 1Co. 12:11. “But all these worketh that one\nand the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.”\n\nMoreover, it is not correct to assert this of the “wind.” We do know\nwhence it comes and whither it goes, and the Scriptures them-\nthemselves assert that the comings and goings of the wind can be\neasily known and traced. See Job. 1:19. Psa. 18:10. Ecc. 1:6, Eze.\n37:9. Luk. 8:23. But not so of the Spirit (see Ecc. 11:5), where “spirit”\nis placed in direct contrast with “wind” in the previous verse.\nThe things opposed in the immediate context are flesh and spirit,\nearthly things and heavenly things, nature and grace, and AS the\nSpirit in His movements is contrary to nature and above nature, SO is\nevery one who is born of the Spirit. Those who are thus born are “sons\nof God, therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not”\n(1Jn. 3:1). As the world knoweth not and understands not the motions\nand working of the Spirit of God, so the new breathings, and new will,\nand new desires, and new motions of the new nature in those who are\nborn of the Spirit are also unknown.\n\nRom. 8:24.-“Hope that is seen is not hope.”\nGal. 2:20.-In this verse the figure, which is in the Greek, is lost in the\ntranslation owing to the difference of idiom. In the Greek it reads:-\n\n“Christ, | have been crucified-together-with, yet | live: and yet it is\nno longer | that live, but, in me, Christ.”\n\nSee also under Hyperbaton.\n\nPhp. 4:4.-“Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again | say Rejoice.”\nJam. 2:14-16.-The passage begins and ends with the words, “What\ndoth it profit.”\nThe repetitions at the beginning and end of distinct portions, or\nindependent passages (such as Psa. 8:1-9, ciii., etc.), belong rather to\nthe subject-matter and are classed under Correspondence (q.v.

[Note: Which see.] ), tohoo and bohoo.\nNow, whatever may be the meaning of tohoo (Wal), it is expressly\nstated, in Isa. 45:18, by Him who created the earth that “He created it\nnot tohoo (Ualy.” Therefore it must at, and after some subsequent\nperiod of unknown duration, have fallen into the ruin which the second\nverse declares and describes.\n\nThe repetition of the word “earth” here, directs our attention to this\nfact; and proceeds to describe the process by which the earth was\nrestored and peopled.\n\nThe whole chapter exhibits a parallel between this work, and that\n“new creation” [Note: Compare 2Co. 4:6; 20ο. 5:17, etc.; and see a\npamphlet on “The New Creation and the Old,” by the same author and\npublisher.] which takes place in the case of every one who is born\nagain of the Holy Ghost, and has the new man created within him.\n\n*Gen. 7:18-19.-“And the ark went upon the face of the waters: and\nthe waters prevailed exceedingly.” (See under Epizeuxis).\n*Gen. 31:6-7.-“Ye know that with all my power | have served your\nfather: and your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages\nten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.” (See under\nHysterologia and Idiom.\n\n*Gen. 31:33-34.-“Then went he out of Leah’s tent and entered into the\ntent of Rachel.

[Note: Which\nsee.] ) shall cry out for and expect the corn and wine and oil; and\nthese, by the beautiful figure of Prosopopoeia (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]\n), are represented as hearing, and in their turn, crying out to the Earth\nto bring them forth: the Earth, in its turn, is represented as hearing\nthem, and crying out to the heavens to send rain and heat and light\nand air; and these in their turn hear, and cry out to Jehovah, the giver\nof all, who in judgment had made the heaven as brass, the earth as\niron, and the rain as powder and dust (Deu. 28:23-24), but who in that\nday will first give repentance to Israel, and then their cry reaches to\nJehovah, who will open the heavens, and give rain, and the Earth\nshall bring forth her fruit (Jer. 14:22).\n\nThus the figures Epizeuxis (“I will hear”), Polysyndeton, Climax,\nand Prosopopoeia are heaped together to express the coming fulness\nof Israel\'s blessing.\n\nJoe. 1:3-4.-Τηθ prophecy of Joel opens with the solemnity which this\nfigure always gives. “Tell ye\nyour children of it, and let\nyour children tell\ntheir children, and\ntheir children another generation.\nThat which the palmerworm hath left hath\nthe locust eaten; and that which\nthe locust hath left hath\nthe cankerworm eaten; and that which\nthe cankerworm hath left hath\nthe caterpiller eaten.”\nJoh. 1:1-2.-“In the beginning was\nthe Word: and\nthe Word was with\nGod: and\nGod\nthe Word was, and\nthe same [word] was in the beginning with God.”\n\nThe order of the words as thus placed in the Greek exhibits, by the\nfigure of Climax, a great solemnity in the measured rising of the\nsense, and emphasizes the fact that “the word was God,” for the use\nof the article in the third proposition preserves the actual sense from\nbeing mistaken or hidden by the Climax, which is obtained by the\ninversion of the words from their natural order.\n\nThus, beautifully is the true Deity of the Lord Jesus affirmed.\n\nHis attributes and their effect are similarly marked in verses 4 and\n5-\n\nJoh. 1:4-5.-“In Him was\nlife; and the\nlife was the\nlight of men.

Afterwards it becomes the figure of\nMesodiplosis, inasmuch as the word “day” occurs in the middle of\nsuccessive sentences, the first part of which consists of the repetition\nof the Ellipsis: “That day is ...”\nMat. 10:40-41.-Here the verb “receive” is repeated several times at\nthe beginning and middle of several sentences.',''),(28,28,'mesodiplosis','2Co. 4:8-9.-\n\n“We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;\nWe are perplexed, but not in despair:\nPersecuted, but not forsaken;\nCast down, but not destroyed.”',''),(29,29,'mesoteleuton','2Ki. 19:7.-“Behold | will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a\nrumour, and shall return to his own land: aud | will cause him to fall\nby the sword in his own land.”\n\nThe repetition greatly emphasizes the fact stated.\nIsa. 8:12.-“Say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people\nshall say a confederacy.”\nThere is the figure also of Polyptoton (q.v.

The use of this figure strongly\nforbids the interpretation of this passage to any but Israel (verses 22,\n32).\n\nJoh. 14:1-4.-The repetition of the pronouns “I” and “you” emphasizes\nthe fact that nothing is to come between the Lord and the hearts of His\npeople, so that His promised return may be the object ever before\nthem.\n\nJoh. 16:12-15.-Here, the verbs “shall” and “will” are repeated eleven\ntimes in these four verses, in order to impress us with the importance\nof the promise and the absolute certainty of its performance.\n\n“| have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow. Howbeit, when He, the Spirit of truth, is (shall have) come, He\nwill guide you into all truth (“all the truth,” R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ): for He shall not speak of ({6., from) Himself; but\nwhatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will show you\nthings to come. He shall glorify me: for He shall receive of mine, and\nshall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine:\ntherefore said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto\nyou.”\nThus is emphasized the solemn promise of the Lord Jesus that the\nHoly Spirit should give a further revelation of Truth, which could not be\nmade known at that time. We have it in the seven Epistles addressed\nto churches by the Holy Spirit, through Paul.* [Note: See Things to\nCome for 1898 and 1899.] That great promise cannot find its\nfulfillment subjectively or individually, giving “truths” to different\npersons, so different (not to say opposite) that fierce controversies\nrage concerning them. It cannot have been fulfilled in the inspiration of\nany one church. It can have been fulfilled only by the provision of\nthose text-books of Christian doctrine, which we have in the “Pauline”\nEpistles addressed to churches, beginning with Romans and ending\nwith Thessalonians. Here, we have “all the truth” into which the Spirit\nwas to guide. Truth which glorifies Christ and instructs the Christian as\nto his standing before God and his walk with God. No other part of\nGod’s Word contains such a body of Christian Theology. Every\nScripture is written for us, “for our learning”; but these are written\nspecially about the Church of God.\n\nGal. 4:9.-“How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements\nwhereunto ye desire again to be in bondage.”\n\nBy this repetition we are pointed to the key to this whole passage,\nas well as to the explanation of an obscure word and a difficult\nexpression. All turns on the meaning of the word, which is rendered\n“elements” (oTolxgia, stoicheia). “The elements of the world” (verse 3),\nand “weak and beggarly elements” (verse 10). The word “again,” twice\nused, connects these two together, and emphasizes them.\n\nVerse 3 reads:-\n\n“Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the\nστοικεῖα τοῦ κόσμου”. (stoicheia tou kosmou): i.e., the stoicheia\npertaining to the world.\n\nIt is clear what the cosmos is, for it is the world with reference to its\ncreation, and embraces the whole world. But what are the stoicheia?\nThe answer is given in verse 8, “When ye knew not God ye did service\n(or ‘were in bondage,’ the same word as in verses 3 and 10) unto\nthem which by nature are no gods.” The stoicheia were the rites and\nceremonies of heathen idolatry.\n\nIn Greece to-day every mountain, tree, and grove and fountain has\nits stoicheion or god, who has to be appeased and propitiated.\nThese Galatians had been such idolators (verse 8), but they had\nabandoned these rites and ceremonies for Christianity, and yet\nwanted to bring in the stoicheia, or the rites and ceremonies of\nJudaism into the Church.\n\nThe same term is thus applied both to Paganism and Judaism,\nand from the stand-point of being “all one in Christ Jesus” (3:28).\n\nThe Jewish rites of circumcision, purification, and the observance\nof “days and months and times and years,” etc., are put upon the\nsame level as the worship and propitiation of spirits in trees and\nmountains, etc. And the Holy Spirit asks by the apostle, “When ye\nknew not God ye were in bondage unto them which by nature are no\ngods. But now having known God ... how turn ye again unto the weak\nand beggarly stoicheia whereto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye\nobserve days and months and times and years. | am afraid of you, lest\n| have bestowed upon you labour in vain” (Gal. 4:8-11. Compare Col.\n2:16-18).\n\nHence, stoicheiolatry consists of introducing that which belongs to\nthe world (κόσμος, cosmos) into Christian worship and practice.\nRomanism has given the stfoicheia of paganism and Judaism a very\nlarge place in its creeds and ritual; While the Protestant Churches\nshow that they have not wholly purged themselves from them when\nthey adopt worldly methods and adapt Jewish rites and ceremonies to\nChristian faith and practice.\n1Th. 5:1-2; 1Th. 5:4-5.-The repetition of the pronoun “you” and “ye” in\nthese verses stands in marked contrast to the repetition of the\npronouns “they” and “them” in verse 3, thus pointing out to us the\nsignificant lesson that those who are “waiting for God’s Son from\nHeaven” are not concerned with “times and seasons” which have to\ndo with “the day of the Lord,” and His coming as “a thief’ on the\nungodly. The day of the Lord is His coming with His saints unto the\nworld. But, before this can happen, He will have come forth into the air\nto receive them to Himself (1Th. 4:1-18.) Therefore, though “times and\nseasons” have to do with “the day of the Lord,” they have nothing to\ndo with those who look for “the day of Christ.”\n2Ti. 3:14-15.-“But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned\nand hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them:\nand that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are\nable to make thee wise unto salvation.”\n\nThis is in harmony with the whole of this second epistle to Timothy,\nwhich is thus marked as being so different from the first epistle.\n\nIn the first epistle we see the Church in its rule; and in the second,\nwe see it in its ruin. In the first, Timothy is instructed as to how he is to\nconduct himself in the Church in its corporate capacity; whom he is to\nappoint to its various offices; and what are to be their qualifications,\netc., etc.\n\nBut when we pass to the second epistle we find all changed. The\ncorporate position and testimony of the Church is gone, and all now is\nindividual-intensely individual, as may be seen all through. In the four\nchapters we have the four stages of the “Down-grade movement.”\n\nIn 1:15 all turn away from Paul’s teaching: but “I am not ashamed:\nfor | know whom | have believed” (verse 12): “Be not thou ashamed”\n(verse 8), “I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee”\n(verse 5).\n\nIn chap. 2:18, 19, others err “concerning the truth. Nevertheless,\nthe foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord\nknoweth them that are his. And let everyone that nameth the name of\nChrist depart from iniquity.”\nIn chap. 3:8 there are those who “resist the truth,” but the only\nhope is for the individual believer to cling fast to the God-breathed\nword, and to use this sword of the Spirit.\n\nIn chap. 4:4 there are and shall be those who turn away their ears\nfrom the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” The immediate\ninjunction follows: “but watch thou in all things ... make full proof of\nthy ministry, etc.”\n\nAll this is emphasized and forced upon our notice by the repetition\nof the pronouns in this epistle.\n\nRev. 8:7-12.-Eleven times are the words, the “third part” repeated (τὸ\nτρίτον, Ю triton).',''),(31,31,'polyptoton','I.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is no\nimprovement:-\n\n“Shall men fall, and not rise up again?\n\nShall one turn away and not return?”\n\nThe Massorah* [Note: Ginsburg’s Edition, Vol. ΙΙ, page 54.] calls\nattention to the fact that of the two words “turn and,” the first letter of\nthe second word should be the last letter of the first word, this being\none of the examples where words are wrongly divided.\n\nThus read the sense comes out in agreement with the context of\nwhich Israel is the subject:-\n\n“Shall they fall and not arise?\nShall they return [fo Him] and He not return [fo them].\n\nThis agrees also with Mal. 3:7, and it brings out the\ncorrespondence between the two lines, as well as exhibits more\nclearly the Polyptoton.\n\nMat. 11:15.-“He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” ὦτα ἀκούειν,\nἀκουέτω (gota akouein akouetq).\n\nOn fourteen occasions in the New Testament does the Lord use\nthis expression (thus, or in similar words), and we place them all\ntogether here under the first occurrence so that we may see the\nfulness of the cumulative effect.\n\nIn the English we have a Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]) as\nwell, “ears {ο hear,” but not in the Greek, except in the case of the\neight in Revelations, where we have οὓς ακουσάτω (ous akousato).\nThe real figure lies in the emphatic polyptoton in each case.\n\nThis solemn injunction was never used by mere human lips. No\nmortal man could demand the attention to which this emphatic\ncommand lays claim None but the Lord ever used these words. They\nare (unlike many other of the examples) translated literally, but they\nmean: He whose ears are opened, let him surely hear, or let him take\nheed to give the most earnest attention!\n\nThis attention and obedience the Lord claimed on fourteen\nseparate occasions.\n\nThe fourteen are not divided into two sevens, but into six and eight\n(two fours and two threes).\nSix being the number of man, He spoke the words six times as\n“the Son of Man” on earth: and eight being the number of\nresurrection), He spoke the words eight times as the Risen Lord from\nheaven.\n\nThough the occasions were fourteen (7 X 2) on which the words\nwere used, the actual number of times the words are written down by\nthe Holy Spirit is sixteen (4 X 4, or 42), two being in the parallel\npassages in the Gospels.* [Note: For the significance of these\nnumbers see Number in Scripture (pp 20-47). by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nThese fourteen occasions are connected with different parts of one\ngreat subject, which is dispensational in its character: and this figure\nbeing used only of this one subject, points us to the significant fac that\nit requires the Divinely opened ear to understand the great\ndispensational change which was about to take place.\n\nIt had been foretold in Isa. 6:9 (see above) that it should come\nabout in consequence of the ears being closed to the divine\nannouncement: and seven times this solemn infliction of judicial\nblindness is written down in the Scriptures of Truth.\n\nWhen the great change was announced in consequence and\nfulfillment of this! then, fourteen times did the Lord Himself emphasize\nthe important fact that only the opened ear would be able to\nunderstand it; implying that it referred to secret things, and that only\nthose to whom that secret was revealed would be able to understand\nit or receive it.\nFor the interpretation of these fourteen occurrences, see Things to\nCome (July to Dec., 1896; Jan. and Feb., 1897; Sept. and Oct., 1898,\netc.)* [Note: G.

The first is οὐκ οἶδας (ouk\noidas), thou knowest not as a matter of fact. The second is γνώσῃ\n(σπφςεε) thou shalt learn, i.e., get to know hereafter.” It is this latter\nverb which is used in 1Co. 2:14, for the natural man not only cannot\nreceive, or discern, them, but he cannot even /earn them, or get to\nknow them, not having the necessary spiritual capacity.\n\nJoh. 13:10.-Here again there is no Polyptoton of the verb to wash, as\nappears in the English, for in the Greek the two words are quite\ndifferent. “He that is washed (λελουµένος, leloumenos, i.e., bathed)\nneedeth not save to wash (viwao8al, nipsasthai, i.e., to wash a part of\nthe body) his feet.” The teaching is that he who is purged by the\noffering on the brazen altar, needeth only the water of the brazen\nlaver, which was for “the priests to wash in.” So those who are\nregenerated by the Holy Ghost and have their standing in Christ need\nonly the washing of the hands and the feet, {6., the cleansing of their\nworks and ways by “the washing of water by the word.”\n\nJoh. 17:26.-“And | have declared unto them thy name and will\ndeclare it.”\n\nJoh. 17:25.-“O righteous Father, the world hath not known (éyvw,\nедпф) thee: but | have known (ἔγνων, egnapn) thee, and these have\nknown (ἔγνωσαν, egnosan) that thou hast sent me.”\n\nRom. 2:21-23.-“Thou therefore that teachest (6 διδάσκων ho\ndidaskqpn) another, teachest (διδάσκεις, didaskeis) thou not thyself?\n\nThou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal (uu\nκλέππειν, KAETITEIC, Mee ΚΙερίείη, klepteis)?\n\nThou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou\ncommit adultery (μὴ µοιχεύειν, µοικεύεις, Mee moicheuein,\nmoicheueis)?\n\nThou that makest thy boast of the law (νόµωῳ, потф) through\nbreaking the law (νόµου, nomou), dishonourest thou God?”\n1Co. 6:2.-“Do ye not know that the saints shall judge (κρινοῦσιν,\nkrinousin) the world? and if the world shall be judged (κρίνεται,\nkrinetai) by you, are ye unworthy [fo judge] (Ellipsis of the verb) the\nsmallest matters (κριτηρίων, kriteeriqn), i.e., “are you unworthy [fo\njudge] the smallest judgments?”\n\n2Co. 1:10.-“Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth\ndeliver: in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us.”\nGal. 1:8-9.-“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any\nother gospel (sUayyeAiZntal, euangelizeetai) unto you than that which\nwe have preached (εὐηγγελισάμεθα, eueengelisametha) unto you, let\nhim be accursed.

[Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “I\nwill surely give the tenth unto thee.”\n\nGen. 37:33.-“Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.”\nThe Heb. is δΐό δῖό (taroph, toraph), tearing, he is torn. The\nfigure employed shows the intensity of Jacob’s feelings. He exclaims:\n“The tunic of my son!\nА йа beast hath devoured him!\nTearing-Joseph is torn.”\nLe., he hath been certainly killed or cruelly mangled.\nExo. 3:16.-“l have surely visited you.” Hebrew, visiting | have visited\nyou.\nExo. 19:12.-Here the figure is translated: “He ... shall be surely put to\ndeath.” Lit., stoning, he shall be stoned.\nSo verse 13: “He shall surely be stoned.”\nJos. 24:10.-“But | would not hearken unto Balaam: therefore he\nblessed you still.” Hebrew, blessing, he blessed you: i.e., he kept\nblessing you, or he surely blessed you, or he did nothing but bless\nyou, or he blessed you exceedingly.\n\n2Ki. 3:23.-“The kings are surely slain.” Hebrew, destroying they are\ndestroyed.\n\nPsa. 118:18.-“The Lord hath chastened me sore.” Hebrew, Jah\nchastening hast chastened me.\n\nIsa. 6:9.-“Hear ye indeed.” Hebrew, Hear ye in hearing. “And see ye\nindeed.” Hebrew, “See ye in seeing,” etc.\n\nOn four occasions is this great dispensational prophecy repeated\nin the New Testament in order to emphasise and call attention to the\ngreat change which was about to take place.\n\n1. Mat. 13:14. Mar. 4:12. Luk. 8:4.\n\n2. Joh. 12:39-40.\n\n3. Act. 28:25-27,\n\n4. Rom. 11:8.\nThus, seven times in all, this great prophecy is written down by the\nHoly Spirit in the Scriptures of Truth.\n\nSee Mat. 11:15 above (page 269).\nJer. 22:10.-“Weep sore for him that goeth away.” Hebrew, weeping\nweep.\nJer. 23:17.-“They say still unto them that despise me,” etc. Hebrew,\nsaying they say: i.e., they maintain, or they keep saying, etc.\nDan. 11:13.-“He shall certainly come.” Hebrew, coming he shall\ncome.\nZec. 8:21.-“Let us go speedily.” Hebrew, going let us go.\nMat. 13:13.-“Because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear\nnot”: i.e., they are determined not to hear and not to see.\n\nSee also Mar. 4:12. Luk. 8:10. Joh. 12:40. Act. 28:26; and Rom.\n11:8 : where Isa. 6:9 is quoted.\nAct. 7:34.-Here the figure of Polyptoton is translated as though it were\nEpizeuxis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). Lit. it is “Seeing | have seen”:\ni.e., | have surely seen.\nAct. 28:26-27.-See Mat. 13:13.\nRom. 11:8.-See Mat. 13:13.\nRom. 12:15.-In this verse we have two examples of the repetition of\nthe infinitive and participle.\n\n“Rejoice with them that do rejoice (xaipeiv μετὰ Χαιρόντων,\nchairein meta chairontqdbn), and weep with them that weep (κλαίειν\nμετὰ κλαιόντων, klaiain meta klaiontdbn).”\n\nTwo other figures are combined here-Homoeopropheron and\nHomeeoptoton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\n\nHeb. 6:14.-“Surely blessing | will bless thee, and multiplying | will\nmultiply thee”: i.e., Surely in blessing | will most certainly bless thee,\netc.\n\n(b) In strong negation\nGen. 3:4.-“And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely\ndie.”\n\nHere the serpent emphatically denies Jehovah’s words, and says,\ndying thou shalt not die.\nHe is thus introduced to us in his special sphere-denying the Word\nof God. For he is the god of this world’s religion and not of its crimes\nand immoralities. And his sphere is in the corruption of the truth rather\nthan in the degradation of the flesh.* [Note: See The Silence of God,\nby Robert Anderson, LL.D., C.B., published by Hodder and\nStoughton.]\n\nExo. 5:23.-“Thou hast not delivered them at all.”\n\nThus beautifully is the figure rendered. Hebrew, delivering thou\nhast not delivered them.\n\nExo. 34:7.-“And wilt by no means clear the guilty.” Hebrew, clearing\nthou wilt not clear. Even so the Substitute of the Lord’s people was\nnot cleared. When he bore their sins he bore the punishment also that\nwas due to them.\n\nPsa. 49:7 (8).-“None of them can by any means redeem his brother.”\n\nThus beautifully is the figure rendered, which the R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] has not attempted to improve.\n\nHebrew, a brother redeeming doth not redeem a man: i.e., even\nthough he pay down the price there is no redemption.\n3. Verbs with cognate noun\nA verb and a cognate noun are used together, when great emphasis is\nplaced upon the assertion or expression. It is a kind of superlative\ndegree in verbs to declare the magnitude and gravity of an action or\nthe greatness and importance of its results.\nGen. 1:11.-“Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed.”\nLit., seeding seed. Thus emphasizing the fact that trees, etc., were\ncreated bearing the seeds: and not the seeds producing the trees. The\nhen was created producing the egg, and not the egg producing the\nhen. Thus, at the very outset of the Word of God, the modern figment\nof “evolution” is exploded.\nGen. 8:21.-“And the Lord smelled a sweet savour.” Lit., smelled the\nsweet smell, or the savour of rest: {6., Jehovah accepted the\nsacrifice, and was satisfied with the atonement made by Noah.\n\nThe figure of Anthrapopatheia (q.v. [Note: Which see] ) is\ninvolved.\nGen. 27:3.-“Take me some venison.” Lit., hunt me some hunting, {6.,\nfetch me some game.\n\nThe Ixx. similarly expresses it θήρευσόν µοι θήραν.\n\nVenison, so called from the Latin venatio, to hunt.\nGen. 27:33.-“And Isaac trembled very exceedingly.”\nThus beautifully is the Hebrew figure turned into an English idiom.\nThe Hebrew is: “And Isaac trembled with a great trembling\ngreatly.” (See margin).\nGen. 27:34.-“And ... Esau ... cried with a great and exceeding bitter\ncry.”\nGen. 28:20.-“And Jacob vowed a vow,” i.e., solemnly vowed.\nGen. 30:8.-“And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have | wrestled\nwith my sister.” Lit., “with wrestlings of God, have | wrestled with my\nsister’; where we have another figure, Enallage, by which the Noun “of\nGod?” is used instead of the adjective “great,” denoting therefore “with\nvery great and super-human wrestlings have | wrestled.” (See\nEnallage).\nGen. 35:14.-“And Jacob set up a pillar lé6a i64a (vayatzev\nmaitzevah), lit., and he pillared a pillar. So verse 20.* [It seems clear\nthat this should be the reading also in Gen. 33:20, where we have the\nsame verb bbb (vayatzev), which means {ο stand or rear up, as\none lifts and sets up a (single) memorial stone which we now call a\nЕ\n“menhir.” But the noun is different §)Lb:(mizbeach), which means an\naltar. Some ancientan altar. Some ancientscribe either mistook\nmatzevah (a pillar) and wrote mizbeach (an altar), or the noun was\noriginally abbreviated by the use of the initial letter 7 (mem) and was\nafterwards filled out incorrectly. Because the verb that always goes\nwith altar is tot (banah), to build, as with bricks, etc. (except in Gen.\n35:1; Gen. 35:3 and Exo. 30:1, where it is oe (asah), to make; and\n1Ki. 16:32, where it is eV] (kum), to raise or set up as a building, and\nnot O\'OLL (natzav), fo stand up as a pillar).]\nNum. 4:23.-“All that enter in to serve the service to work the work in\nthe Tabernacle of the congregation.”\nNum. 11:4.-“And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a\nlusting.” Hebrew, lusted a lust: {6., lusted exceedi\nNum. 16:30.-“But if the Lord make a new thing.” Hebrew, create a\ncreation: i.e., do something wonderful.\n1Sa. 4:5.-“All Israel shouted with a great shout”: i.e., with a very loud\nand prolonged or sustained cry.\n2Sa. 12:16.-“And David fasted,” Jit, fasted a fast: i.e., completely or\ntruly fasted.\n\n2Sa. 13:36.-“And all his servants wept very sore.” In Hebrew the figure\nis “wept a great weeping greatly.”\n\n1Ki. 1:40.-“The people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great\njoy”: i.e., their joy scarcely knew bounds.\n\n2Ki. 4:13.-“Thou hast been careful for us with all this care”: ie.,\nexceedingly careful.\n2Ki. 13:14.-“Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness”: i.e., was\nexceeding sick so that he died.\n\n2Ki. 19:7.-“He shall hear a rumour,” lit, hear a hearing, * [Note: See\nMetonymy (of adjunct).] ie., he shall hear important news, something\nthat will upset his plans.\n\nPsa. 14:5; Psa. 53:5.-“There were they in great fear.” The Figure is\n“they feared a fear.”\n\nPsa. 144:6.-“Cast forth lightning.” Heb., lighten lightning, i-e., lighten\nexceedingly, and destroy them.\n\nPro. 30:24.-“Wise, made wise.” Here, the emphasis created by the\nrepetition in the form of Polyptoton, makes a superlative adjective and\nis beautifully and idiomatically rendered “exceeding wise.”\n\nMan is by nature ignorant. He is born more ignorant than the\nbeasts. He has, therefore, to be “made wise”; and, in spiritual things,\nthis can be done only by the Holy Spirit of God.\n\nIsa. 8:12.-“Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid (i.e., fearful).\nSanctify the Lord of hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear.”\n\nIsa. 22:17.-“Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty\ncaptivity.” This verse and the next are very difficult, as is attested by a\ncomparison of the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] with their marginal readings. The above words are literally,\n“Behold, Jehovah will hurl thee with the hurling of a [strong] man.”\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] expresses it: “The Lord\nwill hurl thee away violently.”\nJer. 22:16.-“He judged the cause.” Lit., He judged the judgment; i.e.,\nrighteously judged.\n\nSo Lam. 3:59.\nJer. 51:2.-“And will send unto Babylon fanners (créi, zareem) that\nshall fan her lerla, vzerbiaha).”\nEze. 18:2.-“What mean ye that ye use this proverb? Heb.: juééi\nrulaia é (mishleem eth-hammahshal). Lit., ye proverb this\nproverb, i.e., ye have this proverb in constant use.\nEze. 38:12.-“То take a spoil, and to take a prey.” Lit., to spoil spoil\nand to prey prey; i.e., to take great spoil and a great prey.\nDan. 11:3.-“A mighty King shall stand up that shall rule with a great\nrule”; {6., have a vast dominion.\nJon. 1:10.-“Then were the men exceedingly afraid.” Lit., feared with\ngreat fear.\n\nMic. 2:4.-‘In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and\nlament with a lamentation of lamentations”: {6., shall exceedingly\nlament. Or, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] “lament with a doleful lamentation.” See\nbelow, page 284.\n\nNah. 1:15 (2:1.).-“Keep thy solemn feasts.” Hebrew, Feast thy solemn\nfeasts.\n\nThe figure gives a superlative degree, as it were, to the verb,\nimplying that, before this, feasts had only been formally observed:\nhenceforth they are to be truly celebrated.\n\nHab. 3:2.-Ὁ Lord, | have heard thy speech, and was afraid.” Hebrew,\n| have heard hearing of thee, i.e., | have heard thy fame.\n\nZec. 1:2.-“The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers.” The\nfigure is thus beautifully rendered. Lit., it is “Jehovah hath been\ndispleased with displeasure with your fathers.”\n\nVerse 14. Ч am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great\njealousy,” {6., | am exceedingly jealous.\nVerse 15. “I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at\nease.” Lit., “with a great wrath am | wroth.”\nZec. 7:9.-“Execute true judgment.” Thus elegantly is the figure\nexpressed: “Judge judgment of truth.” See Joh. 7:24.\n\nThis Hebrew idiom appears in the New Testament, showing that\nthough the words are Greek the thoughts and idioms are Hebrew.\n(See under Idioma).\nMat. 2:10.-“They rejoiced with exceeding great joy.” (ἐχάρησαν\nχαράν, echareesan charan).\n\nSee this verge under Ellipsis.\n\nMar. 4:41.-“They feared exceedingly” (ἐφοβήθησαν — ФОВом,\nephobeetheesan phobon). Lit., they feared a fear.\n\nLuk. 22:15.-“With desire | have desired to eat this passover with\nyou.”\n\nHaving translated the figure literally in the Text, the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] half\nrepents it, and gives the English idiom in the margin, “/ have heartily\ndesired.”\n\nJoh. 6:28.-“What shall we do that we might work the works of God?”\ni.e., might really do what God wills us to do.\n\nJoh. 7:24.-“Judge righteous judgment” (τὴν δικαίαν κρίσιν κρίνατε,\nteen dikaian krisin krinate). See Zec. 7:9.\n\nAct. 23:12.-“Certain of the Jews banded together, and bound\nthemselves under a curse.” (Marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , or, with an\noath of execration).\nAnd then, in verse 14, to emphasize this, they say, “We have\nbound ourselves under a great curse.” ἀναθέματι ἀνεθεμαήσαμεν.\n(anathemati anethematisamen.) Lit., we have vowed a great vow.\n\nAnathematizo means to devote, and so to separate from;\nespecially to devote to destruction.\n\nEph. 6:18.-“Praying always with all prayer,” i.e., earnestly praying.\nCol. 2:19.-“Increaseth with the increase of God” (αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν,\nauxei teen auxeesin). Lit, increaseth the increase, i.e., receives\nabundant increase from God, or worthy of God: or, receives Divine\nincrease.\n\n1Ti. 1:18.-“That thou ... mightest war a good warfare” (στρατεύῃ\nστρατείαν, strateuee strateian). This comes also under the figure of\nParonomasia (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).\n\n2Ti. 4:7.-“| have fought a good fight” (τὸν ἀγῶνα τὸν καλὸν\nἠγώνισμαι, ton адфпа ton kalon eegapnismai): i.e., | have earnestly\nfought the good fight.\n\nJam. 5:17.-“He prayed earnestly.” This is the beautiful rendering of the\nfigure προσευχῇ προσηύξατο (proseuchee proseeuxato) with prayer\nhe prayed. See Paronomasia.\nRev. 16:9.-“And men were scorched with great heat.” Lit., burnt with\ngreat burning, i.e., exceedingly burnt.\n\nRev. 17:6.- wondered with great wonder’ (A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\nadmiration), i.e., | wondered exceedingly.\n\nThis figure exists even when the noun is absent through the figure\nof Ellipsis:\n\nNum. 11:14.-1 am not able to bear [the burden ой all this people\nalone, because it, [/.e., the burden] is too heavy for me.”\n\nVerse 17 shows that the word burden is implied; and that Moses\nmeans, | am not able to bear the heavy burden of all this People\nalone. (See under Ellipsis, page 56).\n\nPsa. 13:3.-Here the noun is actually supplied in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] “Sleep\nthe sleep of death,” i.e, sleep the last solemn sleep of death.\n\n4. Verbs with other parts of speech. (Combined Polyptoton)\nIsa. 24:16.-“My leanness, my leanness,* [Note: This is the figure of\nEpizeuxis (q.v.).] woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt\ntreacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very\ntreacherously.”\n\nHere, from the two roots “deal” and “treachery” is heaped together\n\nthis variety of inflections, to enhance the result of the enemy’s\ntreatment.\nHos. 10:1 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).-“Israel is a\nluxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit: according to the\nmultitude of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars, according to the\ngoodness of his land they have made goodly pillars” ({6., images).\nHere, in the repetition of the various inflections of the words “fruit,”\n“multiply,” and “good,” and in the repetition of “according to”\n(Anaphora), and in the repetition of sense in “altars” and “images,” our\nattention is arrested and drawn to the fact that prosperity only led the\nPeople astray into idolatry.\n2Co. 10:12.-“For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or\ncompare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they\nmeasuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves\namong themselves, are not wise.\n\nThis is still more emphatic when we see the structure of this verse.\n\nа — For we are not bold (οὐ)\n\nb — ю number (ἐγκρῖναι) or compare (συγκρῖναι) ourselves\nο with certain of them that commend themselves:\nο but they themselves, measuring themselves by\nthemselves,\nb and comparing (συγκρίνοντες) themselves with\nthemselves\n\nа are without understanding (οὐ).\n\nHere in “a” and “a” we have the declaration, in “a” as to what we\nare not, and in “a” as to what they are not.\nIn “b” and “b” we have comparison (συγκρίνω).\n\nIn “c” and “c” we have commending and measuring.\n\nNote also that in “b” and “c” the pronoun occurs once, while in the\ncorresponding members it is answered by a double occurrence.\n\nFor the meaning of the verb “compare,” see below under\n\nadjectives (page 284), and also under Ellipsis, page 77.\nGal. 5:7-10.-“Ye did run well: who did hinder you that ye should not\nobey (πείθεσθαι, peithesthai) the truth? This persuasion (πεισµονή,\npeismonee) cometh not of him that calleth you ... A little eaven\nleaveneth* [Note: Another example of Polyptoton.] the whole lump. |\nhave confidence (πέποιθα, pepoitha) in you through the Lord, that ye\nwill be none otherwise minded.\n\nHere we have three forms of the same word, or three words from\nthe same root. This is lost in the translation. ΓΠΠείθω (peithd) is more\nthan to believe, it is to be persuaded, to hold or hold on to a belief.\nHence, πεῖσμα (peisma) denotes a ship’s cable, by which it holds on,\nand in which it trusts, while πεισµονή is a holding on, here (in verse 8)\nevidently a holding on to one’s own views with obstinacy.\n\nPerhaps the word “confidence” may best be repeated: “who did\nhinder you that ye should not have confidence in the truth? This\nself-confidence cometh not of him that calleth you ... but | have\nconfidence in you,” etc.\nEph. 1:3.-“Blessed (εὐλογητός, eulogeetos) be the God and Father of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed (0 εὔλογησας, ho\neulogeesas) us with all spiritual blessings (εὐλογία, eulogia) in\nheavenly places (or spheres) in Christ”: i.e., who hath richly blessed\nus with all, etc.\nIl. Nouns and Pronouns\n\n1. Nouns repeated in different cases\nEze. 28:2.-“Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the\nLord God (Adonai Jehovah): Because thine heart (GAC) is lifted up,\nand thou hast said | am a God, | sit in the seat of God (2Th. 2:4) in\nthe heart (aéa, {8., in the heart) of the seas; yet thou art a man and\nnot God, though thou set thine heart (248) as the heart (GEA) of\nGod.”\nJoh. 3:13.-“And no man hath ascended up to heaven (εἰς τὸν\nοὐρανόν, eis ton ouranon), but He that came down from heaven (ἐκ\nτοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ek tou ouranou), even the Son of Man which is (or was)\nin heaven (6 ®v ἐν τῷ oUpava, ho фп en @ ouranq).”\n\nIt is to be remembered that the last clause is doubtful. “Many\nancient authorities omit it,” as the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] remarks in the margin.\nBut, taking it as it stands, we have the three inflections of the word\n“heaven,” calling our attention to a great fact that no one has ever\ngone up to heaven that is by his own act (see Pro. 30:4), for the verb\n“ascended” is active: and the tense is the Perfect, meaning no one\nhath ascended up, and is in heaven. The verb, too, is πορευθείς\n(poreutheis), intimating a leisurely journey, not an instantaneous\nrapture.\n\nIt does not deny that men like Enoch and Elijah had been taken up\nby God, which is a very different thing.\n\nAnd then the expression 6 ὤν (ho qpn) is difficult to express in\nEnglish. It is /it., the one being, but it means here not “who is,” but who\nwas in heaven, i.e., before He came down as stated in chap. 1:1, and\nwho shall again “ascend up where He was before” (chap. 6:62).\n\nSo in chap. 1:18, it should be rendered “which was in the bosom of\nthe Father.”\n\nCompare, for this sense, chaps, 9:25; 19:38. Luk. 24:44. 2Co. 8:9.\nAnd see above, under Ellipsis (page 22), and Heterosis.\n\nRom. 4:18.-“Who against hope believed in hope (map ἐλπίδα ἐπ]\néATridi, par elpida ep elpidi).\nRom. 11:36.-“For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all\nthings.”\nGal. 2:19-20.-“For | through the law am dead (died) to the law (ἐγὼ\nyap διὰ. νόµου νόμῳ ἀπέθανον, едф gar dia nomou noma\napethanon), that | might live (ζήσω, геезф) unto God. | am crucified\nwith Christ: nevertheless I live (ζῶ, zqb); yet not | but Christ liveth (2,\nzee) in me, and that [/ife] which | now live (ζῶ, 2ф) in the flesh ! live\n(ζῶ, 2ф) by the faith of the Son of God.”\n\nSee further on this verse under the figure of Epanadiplosis.\n\n2. Nouns repeated in different numbers\n(a) In singular and plural\n\nPsa. 68:15-16 (16, 17).-In the Hebrew it is clearer than in the English,\nbecause what in English requires two or more words, in Hebrew is\nonly one word, or a compound word.\n\n“A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan.\n\nA mountain of mountain peaks is the mountain of Bashan.\nWhy look ye askance (or envy) ye mountain peaks.\n\nAt the mountain which God hath desired for His abode?\n\nYea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.”\n\nThus, is the Hill of Zion specially marked out as the place which\nJehovah chose for His House.\n\nIsa. 2:11.-The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the\nhaughtiness of men shall be bowed down.\n\nSo also in verse 17, where the singular and plural are used\ntogether (as here) to emphasize the far reaching effects of the day of\nthe Lord, here (verse 12) mentioned for the first time in the Bible.\n\nIn other places also we have the same figure: and it tells us that\nGod makes a distinction between “man” and “men,” opposite to that\nwhich the world makes.\n\nAs for “man” God has condemned him root and branch, while the\nworld would deify him.\n\nAs for “men” God saves and blesses them with an everlasting\nsalvation, while the world makes very little of “men” as individuals, and\nindeed pursues them with persecutions, and fights against them with\n“wars and hatreds.”\n\nSee further on this whole passage, under the figures of\nPolysyndeton and Synonymia.\nJer. 15:16.-“Thy words were found, and | did eat them; and thy word\nwas unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.”\n\nHere the two numbers (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.]\nand pl. [Note: |. The Plural Number.] ) in close conjunction, bring out\nthe contrast between the separate “words” and the “word” of God as a\nwhole.\n\nCompare Joh. 17:8; Joh. 17:14; Joh. 17:17.\n\n(b) In singular and genitive plural\n\nA noun is repeated in the genitive plural in order to express very\nemphatically the superlative degree which does not exist in Hebrew.\nSee under Idiom.\nThus this figure is a kind of Enallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), or\nexchange, by which a noun in the genitive plural, is used instead of a\nsuperlative adjective.\n\nGen. 9:25.-“A servant of servants shall [Canaan] be”: i.e., the lowest\nand most degraded of servants, or the most abject slave.\n\nExo. 26:33, etc.-“Holy of holies.” In A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “the most holy.”\nNum. 3:32.-“Chief of the chief.” In A.V.

[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V.

Hence, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] has translated the figure by giving\ntwo different renderings, (“nations” and “countries”) of the one\nrepeated word “land.”\n\nIsa. 58:10.-“If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the\nafflicted soul.”\n\nHere, the word “soul” is first put (by Metonymy) for the feelings of\nkindness, liberality, and charity; and then (by Synecdoche) for the\nperson himself who is in trouble.\n\nIsa. 66:3-4.-Here, the words of Jehovah are emphasized and\nsolemnised by the structure of the passage which exhibits Epanodos\nor Chiasmos (q.v.

Do they provoke\nme to anger? saith the Lord.”\nIn the first place, it is used of the act of the people in provoking\nGod: in the latter, it is used of the punishments inflicted. Do they\nprovoke me? No; they bring upon themselves the anger and fury of\nJehovah, as the next verse goes on to explain.\n\nJer. 8:14.-“Let us be silent there.” Thus the People propose to rest in\nquietness and security in their sin. But the prophet answers them with\nthe same word in a different sense: “The Lord our God hath put us to\nsilence;” j.e., the silence of Divine punishment-the silence of death.\nJer. 34:17.-“Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty ...\nbehold, | proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord.”\n\nThe people had refused to give “liberty” to the oppressed, which\nHe had commanded in verse 9. Therefore He will proclaim another\nkind of liberty-liberty for the sword, and pestilence, and famine to\ndestroy them; as the context shows.\n\nEze. 20:24-26.-Here the figure is heightened by the structure of the\npassage.\n\nA а Because they had not executed my judgments,\n\nb but had despised my statutes,\nВ апа had polluted my sabbaths ...\nA Ь Wherefore | gave them statutes that were not good,\nа and judgments whereby they should not live:\nВ — апа polluted them in their own gifts, etc.”\n\nMat. 8:22.-“Let the dead bury their dead.”\n\nIn the former place, the word refers to the spiritually dead, “dead in\nsin’; in the latter, to those who have departed this mortal life.\nJoh. 1:10.-“The world was made by Him (the Word), and the world\nknew Him not.”\n\nThe former place refers to the created world, the latter to\nunbelieving men.\nJoh. 1:11.-“He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.”\n\nIn the former place, it refers to His own possessions (neuter\nplural); in the latter, to His own people (masculine plural). See under\nPolyptoton.\nJoh. 2:23-24.-“Many believed (πιστεύειν, pisteuein) in His name,\nwhen they saw the miracles which He did. But Jesus did not commit\nhimself (πιστεύειν, pisteuein) unto them.”\n\nIn the former place, the word “believed” means to assent to His\ndoctrines by a confession of faith; in the latter place, to trust as a\nfriend, to place confidence in. The words read therefore: “Many\nbelieved in His name when they saw the miracles which He did. But\nJesus did not himself believe in them.”\nJoh. 3:31.-“He that is of the earth (ἐκ τῆς γῆς, ek tees gees) is of the\nearth (ἐκ τῆς γῆς, ek tees gees), and speaketh of the earth (ἐκ τῆς\nγῆς, ek tees gees);” i.e., he that is of the earth (in respect to his\nnatural birth and origin) is of the earth (in respect to his nature) and\nspeaketh according (to his nature).\nJoh. 4:31-32.-“His disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. But He\nsaid unto them, | have meat to eat that ye know not of.”\n\nIn the former place, the word is used naturally of eating food; in the\nlatter, spiritually, of doing the Father’s will. See verse 34.\nJoh. 19:22.-“What | have written, | have written.”\n\nIn the former place, it refers to the act of writing; in the latter, to the\nwriting which standeth written.\nRom. 2:12.-“As many as have sinned without law (ἀνόμως, anomaps)\nshall also perish without law (ἀνόμως, апотф=). Here, in the former\ncase, it means not under the Law; in the latter, it means without the\njudgment of the Law.\nRom. 2:26.-“If the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,\nshall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision.”\nIn the former place, the word “uncircumcision” denotes the\nGentiles; and in the latter, their condition as fulfilling the requirements\nof the Law. For this is the force of δικαίωµα (dikaiqma), which is not\nrighteousness as a state or condition, but the righteous requirements\nof the Law.\n\nRom. 3:21.-“But now the righteousness of God without the law is\nmanifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.”\n\nIn the former case, the word denotes moral law (no article) without\nthe works of the law, as opposed to faith; in the latter case, the word\ndenotes the Mosaic Law (with article).\n\nN.B.-There is no article before the word righteousness, so that it\nmeans a Divine righteousness: the same as in chap. 1:17.\n\nRom. 3:27.-“Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of\nworks? Nay; but by the law of faith.”\n\nIn the first place it refers to divine law; and in the second not to law\nat all but to faith itself by the genitive of apposition, “the law, i.e., faith,”\nas in 1:17. (See Appendix B).\n\nRom. 7:13.-“But sin, that it might appear sin.”\nIn the former place, sin is used of the old nature; while, in the latter\nit is used of its real sinful nature and character.\n\nRom. 7:23.-“But | see another law in my members, warring against\nthe law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin\nwhich is in my members.”\n\nIn the first and third places, the word “law” refers to the old nature,\nwhich is indwelling sin, because it once lorded it over him, though now\nit only struggles to usurp again; in the second it refers to the divine law\n(i.e., the new nature) implanted in him, which is contrary to the former,\nand contests its claims.\n\nRom. 9:6.-“They are not all Israel which are of Israel.”\n\nHere the former place refers to the true spiritual seed of Israel; the\nlatter denotes Israel according to the flesh, the natural descendants\nfrom Israel\'s loins.\n\nRom. 12:13-14.-“Given (διώκοντες, αἰφκοπίες) to hospitality. Bless\nthem that persecute (διώκοντας, diqbkontas) you.”\n\nThe word διώκειν (αἰφκείη) is used in the former place, and means\nto pursue or follow closely in a friendly sense; but, in the latter place, it\nmeans the same in a hostile sense, to follow closely so as to\npersecute.\n\nIn the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] , the figure is lost by translation. Literally, it is\n“Follow up hospitality. Bless them that follow you up [fo injure you].\n1Со. 11:24.-“And when He had given thanks, he brake it, and said,\nTake, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you.”\n\nHere the verb to break is used, in the former case, in its proper\nsignification: while, in the second place, it is used spiritually for the\nsufferings and crucifixion of Christ; as is clear from Luk. 22:19, where\nthe word is “given.”\n1Со. 15:28.-“And when all things shall be subdued (ὑποτάσσειν,\nhupotassein) unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject\n(ὑποτάσσειν, hupotassein) unto Him that put all things under Him.”\n\nThe verb means {ο arrange in order, but also to reduce to order.\nThe former sense is used of Christ, the latter of all others (as\nexplained on Psa. 110:1).* [Note: See Things to Come for October,\n1898.]\n1Со. 15:28.-“That put all things under him, that God may be all in all.”\n\nIn the first place “all” refers to all created things and beings; in the\nsecond, to all universal power, “that God may be over all things; and,\nin the third, it refers to all places.\n“All,” being an adjective, must be associated with some noun\n(expressed or implied) which it qualifies. Here the nouns are implied,\nand the omission (see under Ellipsis) produces the figure of\nAntanaclasis.\n2Co. 5:21.-“For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.”\n\nThe order of the Greek is not ambiguous as is the English:-\n\n“For He who knew no sin was made sin for us.” Here, in the\nformer place, it means “sin” in the ordinary acceptation of the word;\nwhile in the latter place, it is put by Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]\n) for a sin-offering.\n\nEph. 1:3.-“Blessed (εὐλογητός, eulogeetos) be the God and Father of\nour Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us (6 εὐλογήσας, ho\neulogeesas),” etc.\n\nThis is really Polyptoton. But here we repeat it in order to point out\nthat the word “blessed” is used in two different senses. We do not\nbless God in the same way that He blesses us. The former word is\nalways used of God, the latter may be used of men. The former word\nmeans the Being who is to be spoken well of, the latter means the\nbeing of whom good has been lastingly spoken-especially by God\nHimself.\n1Ti. 6:5-6.-“Supposing that godliness is to be a way of making gain ...\nbut godliness with contentment Is a great way of making gain.”\n\nHere the word πορισµός (porismos) is used in two opposite\nassociations. In the former case of what a false Christianity supposes\nit to be; and in the second, what it really is.\n\nHeb. 2:14.-“That through death he might destroy him that had the\npower of death, that is, the devil.” Here, the first “death” is put by\nSynecdoche, for the atoning results of Christ’s death: while the second\nmeans the act and article of natural or physical death.\n\n1Pe. 3:1.-“That, if any obey not the word [τῷ λόγῳ, tq Ιοοφ: i.e., the\nGospel], they also may without the word [λόγου, /ogou: i.e., speaking\nor talking] be won by the conversation of the wives.”',''),(34,34,'synoeceiosis','Mat. 5:19.-“Whosoever ... shall break one of these least\ncommandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least\nin the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nIn the former place, the allusion is to the distinction which the\nPharisees made between different commandments (just as Rome has\nsince made the distinction between “venial” and “mortal” sins). There\nis no such distinction, and therefore, when in the latter place Christ\nsays “he shall be called the least,” He means that he will not be there\nat all, for there will be no such distinction there. There is no least in\neither case.\n\nMat. 18:1.-“Who, in that case, is the greatest in the kingdom of\nheaven?” In verse 4 Christ answers, “Whosoever shall humble himself\nas this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nIn the former place the disciples use the word in its ordinary sense\nof pre-eminence. But in the latter place Christ (alluding to the former\nsense) means that no one except Himself has ever humbled Himself\nthus: and who is to dispute that He must be greatest in that kingdom.\nThe occasion also is important; compare verse 1 with 17:24-27.\nMat. 19:16-17.-“And behold one came and said unto him, Good\nMaster, what good thing shall | do that | may have eternal life? And\nHe said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but\none, that is God.”\n\nIn the former case, the young man uses the word “good” of mere\ncreature goodness, such as he supposed Christ to have; while in the\nlatter case, the Lord alludes to the first, using the word in the same\nsense, but not in the same way; thus teaching that there is no real\n“good” apart from God-no “good” except that which comes from God\nand returns to Him.\n\nJoh. 6:28-29.-“What shall we do that we might work the works* [Note:\nSee Polyptoton.] of God? Jesus answered ... them, This is the work\nof God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”\n\nIn the former case, the word “works” is used by the Jews in its\nproper acceptation: it is repeated by Christ in the same sense, but with\nanother meaning altogether, as He goes on to explain.\n\nAct. 26:28-29.-Here the apostle repeats the word “almost” (or “with\nlittle” R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) in the same sense, but\nwith a far higher and more extended meaning.',''),(35,35,'syllepsis','2Ch. 31:8.-“They blessed the Lord and his people Israel.”\n\nHere there is a duplex statement. They blessed the Lord, that is\nthey gave Him thanks and celebrated His praises; and they blessed\nHis People Israel; but in a different way; they prayed for all spiritual\nand temporal blessings for them in the name of the Lord.\n\nTwo meanings are thus given to the word, which is used only\nonce. The sense is repeated, but not the word, and the sense is not\nthe same in each case.\n\nJoe. 2:13.-“Rend your heart, and not your garments.”\n\nHere the word “rend” is used only once, but with two significations:\nin the former sentence it is used figuratively; in the latter literally-the\nheart not being rent in the same sense in which garments are rent.',''),(36,36,'symploce','Though there may be more than one word in the English, it does\nnot follow that there is more than one in the original.\n\nIsa. 2:7-8.-We have it in alternate lines:\n\n“Their land also is full of silver and gold,\n\nNeither is there any end of their treasures;\n\nTheir land is also full of horses.\n\nNeither is there any end of their chariots;\nTheir land also is full of idols, etc.”\nIsa. 65:13-14.-‘Thus saith the Lord God,\n\n“Behold my servants shall eat,\n\nBut ye shall be hungry.\nBehold my servants shall drink,\nBut ye shall be thirsty.\nBehold my servants shall rejoice,\nBut ye shall be ashamed.\nBehold my servants shall sing for joy of heart,\nBut ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.”\nIn the last two lines we have Epistrophe in the word heart.\nJer. 9:23 (22).-Here, in the Hebrew, the three sentences begin, “Let\nhim not glory’ (fE|GUAEE, al-yithhalleyl), and each ends with the\npronominal suffix {, his.\n1Co. 12:4-6.-Here in the Greek each verse begins With “diversities”\nor differences (διαιρέσεις, diaireseis), and ends with “the same”\n(αὐτός, autos).\n1Co. 14:15.-Here the two words repeated and emphasized by\nSymploce are “the spirit” and “the understanding.”\n1Co. 15:42-44.-Here we have four pairs, a kind of double Anaphora.\n“It is sown in corruption;\nIt is raised in incorruption.\nIt is sown in dishonour;\nIt is raised in glory.\nIt is sown in weakness;\nIt is raised in power.\nIt is sown a natural body;\nIt is raised a spiritual body.”\n2Co. 9:6.-Here the Greek exhibits a beautiful example of this figure.\n“He that soweth sparingly, sparingly shall reap also:\nHe that soweth bountifully, bountifully shall reap also.”\nWith this is combined the figure of Anadiplosis (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee.] ), in the repetition of the words “sparingly” and “bountifully.”\nRev. 18:21-23.-To emphasize the complete overthrow of Babylon six\ntimes we have the repeated words “no more.”\nBabylon ... shall be found no more at all,\nand the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and\ntrumpeters shall be heard in thee no more at all.\n\nand no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found in\nthee any more at all:\n\nand the sound of a millstone shall be heard in thee no more\nat all.\n\nand the light of a candle shall shine in thee no more at all:\n\nand the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be\nheard in thee no more at all.”\n\nHere we have Anastrophe (i.e., Polysyndeton) combined with\nEpistrophe.\n(b) In a different order (but the same sense)',''),(37,37,'epanodos','Gen. 10:1-31.-\n\nа 1-.

[Note: Which see_] ).\n(3) While petros is used of Peter, petra is used of Christ: for so\nPeter himself understood it (566 1Pe. 2:4-6, and Act. 4:11-12; and so\nthe Holy Spirit asserts in 1Co. 10:4. “And that rock (πέτρα) was\nChrist,” where we have a pure metaphor (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). So\nthat petros represents Peter’s instability and uselessness as a\nfoundation, while petra represents Christ\'s stability as the foundation\nwhich God Himself has laid (1Co. 3:11. Isa. 28:16).\n\nJoh. 13:7 appears to be the Figure of Paregmenon in the English. But\nthere is no figure in the Greek. “What | do thou knowest not now; but\nthou shalt know hereafter.”\n\nHere, the two words “know” are different in the Greek. The first is\nοἶδα (oida), to know, as a matter of absolute knowledge, but the latter\nis γινώσκω (ginqbskqp), to get to know, learn.\n\nJoh. 15:2.-“Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away\n(αἴρει, airei* [Note: Ι.6., he lifteth up, as in Luk. 17:13. Joh. 11:41. Act.\n4:24. Rev. 10:5, and especially Dan. 7:4 (Theodotian’s Version). See\nunder Ellipsis, page 13.] ): and every branch that beareth fruit he\npurgeth itt [Note: Ι.6., he pruneth it.] (καθαίρει, kathairei).”\n\nAct. 8:31.-“Understandest thou what thou readest” (γινώσκεις &\nἀναγινώσκεις, gindskeis ha anagin¢pskeis).\nHere, the former verb means to know by learning, to get to know;\nand the latter (which is the same verb compounded with ava (and),\nagain, means to read, especially, to read out loud.\n\nRom. 2:1.-“Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that\njudgest (0 κρίνων, ho krinqpn), for wherein thou judgest (κρίνεις,\nkrineis) another thou condemnest (κατακρίνεις, katakrineis) thyself;\nfor thou that judgest (0 κρίνων, ho krindpn) doest the same things.”\nRom. 5:19.-“For as by one man’s disobedience (παρακοῆς,\nparakoees) many were made sinners, so by the obedience (ὑπακοῆς,\nhypakoees) of one shall many be made righteous.”\n\nRom. 12:3.-“Not to think of himself more highly (ὐπερφρονεῖν,\nhyperphronein) than he ought to think (φρονεῖν, phronein); but to\nthink (φρονεῖν, phronein) soberly (σωφρονεῖν, scpphronein),” etc.;\nie., “but so to think that he may think soberly.”\n\n1Co. 11:29.-“For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and\ndrinketh damnation (κρίµα, krima) to himself, not discerning\n(διακρίνων, diakrindpn) the body [of the Lora].”\n\nHere the last words “of the Lord” go out (according to L. [Note: .\nLachmann and his critical Greek Text.] T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his\ncritical Greek Text.] Tr. [Note: г. Tregelles and his critical Greek Text.]\nWH. [Note: H. Westcott and Hort, and their critical Greek Text.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ). And the former word krima\nmeans not damnation, but a matter for judgment, an accusation; while\nthe latter word diakringbn means to distinguish, to make a distinction;\nthough, by the act of communion, they professed to belong to the\nBody of Christ, yet if they did not discern the truth connected with that\nBody (i.e., Christ Mystical) and distinguish their fellow-members of that\nBody from all others, they condemned themselves, they accused\nthemselves. For, while they ate and drank thus, they did so unworthily:\nand by that very act they condemned themselves.\n\n1Co. 11:31-32.-“For if we would judge (διεκρίνοµεν, diekrinomen)\nourselves, we should not be judged (ἐκρινόμεθα, ekrinometha). But\nwhen we are judged (κρινόµενοι, krinomenoi) we are chastened of\nthe Lord, that we should not be condemned (κατακριθῶμεν,\nkatakrithcpmen) with the world.”\n20ο. 4:8.-“Perplexed (ἀπορούμενοι, aporoumenoi), but not in despair\n(ἐξαπορούμενοι, exUporoumenoi),” i.e., at a loss to know what to do,\nbut not utterly at a loss.\n\n20ο. 5:4.-“Not for that we would be unclothed (ἐκδύσασθαι,\nekdusasthai), but clothed upon (ἐπενδύσασθαι, ependusasthai)”:\ni.e., that we would not be found naked in the grave, but be clothed\nwith our resurrection body.\n\nThe figure belongs also to Paregmenon (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).\n26ο. 10:6.-“Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience\n(παρακοήν, parakoeen) when your obedience (ὑπακοή, hupakoee) is\nfulfilled.” So Rom. 5:19.\n2Th. 3:11.-“Working (ἐργαζομένους, ergazomenous) not at all, but\nare busybodies (περιεργαζοµένους, periergazomenous).”\n\nIt is difficult to express the thought in English. The latter word\nmeans to overdo anything; to do with pains what is not worth doing.\nWe might say doing nothing, yet over-doing; or, not as official, but\nOfficious; or, not busy, but fussy; or, not doing their own business, but\nthe business of others.\n\nHeb. 10:34.-“Ye ... took joyfully the spoiling of your goods\n(ὑπαρχόντων, huparchontdpn), knowing in yourselves that ye have in\nheaven a better and an enduring substance (ὕπαρξιν, huparxin).”\nJam. 2:4.-“Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become\njudges of evil thoughts?” There the two words διεκρίθητε\n(diekritheete) and κρίται (kritai) are from the same root: the former\nmeans to make a distinction, and the latter judges.\n\nJoh. 3:20.-“For if our heart condemn (καταγινώσκῃ, katagindskee)\nus, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth (γινώσκει, gindpskei)\nall things.”\n\nBoth words are from the same root, and mean {ο know, but the\nformer to know something against; and the latter, simply to know, or\nrather get to know, learn. For nothing can be hidden from God. Man\ncannot get to know our hearts by any means which he may try. God\ncan; and does.',''),(40,40,'paronomasia','Gen. 1:2.-“Апа the earth had become tohp1 (Wl) and Бопы (2al).”\nFor the lesson taught by this (the second Figure used in the Bible),\nsee under Anadiplosis.\nGen. 4:25.-“She called his name Seth (ad, Sheth).

The word éffé (kaaro) is one of\nthese words, and the two places are Isa. 38:13 and Psa. 22:16. There\ncan be no doubt also that some Codices read {ΤΙ (Ка-агы) as a rival\nreading. Dr. Ginsburg concludes from the Chaldee translation that\nboth these readings were at one time in the text, and it is not\nimprobable that one of the words of this pair dropped out.* [Note: See\nhis Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, pp. 968-972.] If this was the\ncase then there was originally not only a beautiful completeness as to\nthe sense, but also a forcible Paronomasia as well.\n\n“They tore (δή, Каагы) like a lion (éfré, kaari) my hands and\nmy feet.” Or\n\n“Like a lion they tore my hands and my feet.”\n\nThis is borne out by the structure of the passage (verses 12-17).t\n[Note: See under Ellipsis, pp. 28, 29.]\n\nThe reading is shown to require the two words, which thus make\nthe beautiful Paronomasia:\n\n“Like a lion they tore my hands and feet.”\n\nExactly as in Isa. 38:13.\nPsa. 25:16.-“Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for | am\ndesolate and afflicted” (Inaé faé, vahno ahno, lit. “afflicted am I”).\nPsa. 39:11 (12).-“When thou with rebukes dost correct man (feu,\nosh) for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth\n(AU, ης)”\nPsa. 40:3 (4).-“Many shall see it ffl ‚ yirbt) and fear (léérrl-\nу’уогаы).” Or, Many will peer and fear.\n\nSee also Psa. 52:6.\nPsa. 53:6 (8).-See Deu. 30:3.\nPsa. 56:8 (9).-“Thou tellest my wanderings (daé, пфаее); put thou\nmy tears into thy bottle (AG/AE, b’nodecha).” The similarity of\nsound is intended to call our attention to the fact that the tears caused\nby our wanderings are noted and noticed by God.\nPsa. 64:4 (5).-“Suddenly do they shoot at him (éfal; уогибы) and\nfear (eérfl; yorakp)) not.”\nPsa. 69:30-31 (31, 32).-“I will praise the name of God with a song\n(aber, b’shor)....

See Deu. 30:3.\n\nPsa. 96:5.- ΕΟΓ all the gods (élréae, kol-elohay) of the nations\nare idols (reeéeei, elolom).” This latter word means nothings, or\nthings of naught; so that we might render it, “The gods of the nations\nare imaginations.”\n\nPsa. 119:13.-With my lips (AUOUE, bispatai) have | declared\n(AOFUE, sipparti).”\n\nPsa. 122:6.-“Pray for (urél; shaalbl) the peace of (uéli, sh’lom)\nJerusalem (efluééi, Y’rbishalayim): they shall prosper (euéel;\nyishlahybt) that love thee.”\n\nPsa. 126:1; Psa. 126:4.-See Deu. 30:3.\n\nPsa. 137:5.-‘If | forget thee, О Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her\ncunning.” This is how the passage stands in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] It has also been treated as\nan Ellipsis (see pp. 9, 10); where we have supplied “me” after the\nverb, i.e., let my “right hand forget me.”\n\nThe first verb is ruéee. (eshkachech), / / forget thee. And the\nsecond is uude (tishkach), /её it forget (third pers. sing. Kal. fut.\nfrom ὑδς, shachach).\n\nDr. Ginsburg suggests that in the transcription from the ancient\nPhoenician characters to the present square Hebrew characters, the\naleph (= is) which originally commenced the latter word, was mistaken\nfor Tau ( = U), which it closely resembles, and thus the verb was\nchanged from the first person to the third in the second clause. If we\nrestore the Aleph i) we have the following sense and a beautiful\nParonomasia:-\n\n“If | forget thee ({ᾷξςρ, eshkachech), Ο Jerusalem, may | forget\n(ruée, eshkach) my right hand.”\nPro. 6:23.-“For the commandment is a lamp, and the law (ΜΙΓΑ,\nv’teprah) is light (fr, opr); and reproofs of instruction are the way of\nlife.”\nPro. 18:24.-The Paronomasia here lies in the word “friends,” ἴπέί,\nreyim, and éaurinn, lehitrepsa (i.e., геуе and гфза: the “т” of the\nformer, and “lehith” of the latter belonging to the inflections). The latter\nis from ima (raah), to break (and not from mma (raah), to feed), and\nmeans to our own detriment, and not to make friends. Then further,\nru (ish) is not a peculiar spelling of réu (osh), man, but stands for\néu, there is. So that the verse reads:\n\n“There are friends to our own detriment (or ruin);\n\nBut there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”\n\nOr, as we might put it:\n“There are friends that break us,\nBut there is a friend that makes us.”\nOr:-\n“There are friends that give us broken hearts,\nBut there is a friend who ne’er departs.”\nEcc. 7:1.-“A good (cla, 1фу) name (uf, shem) is better than\nointment (uid, mishshemen) that is good (cla, tov).\n\nSee under Epanadiplosis.\n\nEcc. 7:6.-“As the crackling (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] sound) of\nthorns (anéréi, hassirim) under the pot (aneéyr, hassir) so is the\nlaughter of fools.”\n\nHere the figure attracts the attention to the fact that the burning of\nthe thorns makes a noise, but it lasts only for a moment and it is all\nover. So it is with the laughter of fools. See further and compare Psa.\n58:9; Psa. 118:12, and Ecc. 2:2.\n\nIt may be Englished thus: “As the sound of the nettle under the\nkettle;” or, “as the flaming of whin* [Note: Furze or gorse.] neath a\ncaldron of tin;” or, “as the blazing of grass neath a caldron of brass.”\nIsa. 2:19; Isa. 2:21.-“When He ariseth to shake terribly (δΗἴό,\nlaar¢ptz) the earth (AITO, haaretz).”\n\nIsa. 5:7.-\"He looked for judgment (11166, mishpat), but behold\noppression (ide, mishpach); for righteousness (6a-a, tzdakah),\nbut behold a cry (ОЙ-а, tzeskeh).”\n\nWe might English this by rendering it, “He looked for equity, but\nbehold iniquity; for a righteous nation, but behold lamentation.”\nIsa. 7:9.-“If ye will not believe (fi ёг ЦЙёб\' im lo taaminbt!),\nsurely ye shall not be established (6é ёг ufidl; ki lo {еатепы.\n\nWe may English it thus:-“If ye will not understand, ye shall not\nsurely stand.” Or,\n\n“If ye have no belief, surely ye shall have no relief.”\n\nOr, “no confiding, no abiding.”\nIsa. 10:16.-“And under his glory he shall kindle (6-a, yekad) a\nburning (6 -Ἔ, уекфа) like the burning (G@-I8, кжфа) of a fire.”\nIsa. 13:4.~\"The Lord of hosts (ОаЙИ, tzevacpth) mustereth the host\n(баг, tzeva) of the battle,” or a host for the battle.\nIsa. 13:6.-“Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as\na destruction (GUA, k’shtbd) from the Almighty (11186, mish-\nshaddai).” The awful nature of that day is emphasized by this figure,\nand our attention is directed to the fact that Destruction comes from\nthe all-bountiful One! It is like “the wrath of the Lamb,” of which we\nread in Rev. 6:16-17. We have the same figure again in Joe. 1:15.\n\nIsa. 15:9.-“For the waters of Dimon (AGiIC’, Dimepn) shall be full of\nblood (Ai, dam).”\n\nIsa. 17:1.-“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city inéy,\nmeyeer) and it shall be a ruinous heap (iné, me-o).” The latter word\nis put for inlé, ma-avee, so that by an unusual form of the word it\nmay allude to the word “city.”\n\nIsa. 17:2.-“The cities (Are, araye) of Aroer” (AAR, Aroer).\n\nIsa. 21:2.-“Go up (ἄξό, alee), Ο Elam (ἄόξί, eylam).”\n\nIsa. 22:18.-“He will surely (ald, tzandph) violently turn (e6dée,\nyitznaphcha) and toss thee (6d6a, tzenepha).”\n\nIsa. 24:3.\"The land shall be utterly (AAl- ΠΙΡΟΦΚ) emptied (IAI-,\nΕΒΟΦΚ), and utterly (AIG, whibbepz) spoiled (MAIC, tibbepz): for\nthe Lord hath spoken this word.”\n\nIsa. 24:4.-“The earth mourneth (Faéa, avelah) and fadeth away\n(daéa, naviah), the world (UAE, tevel) languisheth (Пёёа,\numlelah), and fadeth away (daéa, navlah), the haughty people of\nthe earth do languish (eel; umlalbi).\n\nIsa. 24:17-18.-\"Fear (O€A, pachad), and the pit (δού, v’phachat),\nand the snare (δς, vapach) are upon thee, Ο, inhabitant of the\nearth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of\nthe fear (AO€A, happachad) shall fall into the pit (AOCU,\nhappachat): and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit (a6eu,\nhappachat) shall be taken in tone snare (ad¢, bappach).\nSee also Jer. 48:43-44.\nIsa. 25:1.-O Lord, thou art my God: | will exalt thee (ΠΠ,\nardmimcha), | will praise thy name (faa ὑῖθ, cbdeh shimcha).”\nIsa. 25:6.-“And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all\npeople a feast duda, mishteh) of fat things (uidéi, sh’maneem) a\nfeast (ada, mishteyh) of wines on the lees (uiréi, sh’marim), of\nfat things (uidéi, sh’manim) full of marrow (igéi,\nm’muchayeem), of wines on the lees (uiréi, sh’marim) well\nrefined.\nIsa. 30:16.-“But ye said, No; for we will flee (din, Nanbis) upon\nhorses (nih, 5015): therefore shall ye flee (Μα[ήία, ?nbisbin): and,\nWe will ride upon the swift (-6, kal); therefore shall they that pursue\nyou be swift (-él- yikkallbt).\nIsa. 32:6.-“For the vile person (daé, naval) will speak villainy\n(daéa, n’valah),” where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] preserves the figure very\nwell.\n\nIsa. 32:7.-“The instruments also of the churl (lééé 6éél, vecheleo\nkelav) are evil.”\n\nIsa. 32:19.-“When it shall hail (lara, bivarad) coming down on\n(AF AU, b’redeth) the forest.”\n\nIsa. 41:5.-“The isles saw it (rfl ‚ гаы), and feared (léérrl ‚ V’yirabl):\nthe ends of the earth were afraid (écfal; yecheradbl) drew near (>\nral; Кагмы) and came.\n\nIsa. 54:8.-‘In a little (AUGO, b’shetzeph) wrath (-OO, ketzeph) | hid\nmy face from thee for a moment.”\n\nIsa. 57:6.-“Among the smooth stones (ἀςδ-ό, bechalkai) of the\nstream is thy portion (οὔ-θ, chelkech).”\n\nIsa. 61:3.-“To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them\nbeauty (6Η, p’eyr) for ashes (For, epher).”\nthe Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, What seest thou? And |\nsaid, | see a rod of an almond tree (ἀ-ᾶ, shaked). Then said the Lord\nunto me, Thou hast well seen; for | will watch over it (U-A, shoked).\nSo, A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin.\n\nOur attention is thus called to the fact that the almond tree has to\ndo With judgment deferred, but finally executed. This is just what we\nhave in Jeremiah: and hence it is the truth set forth in the opening\nchapter.\n\nThe times of the Gentiles are passed over to show that their\njudgment is deferred tiff that foretold shall have been executed on\nBabylon (chap. 25).\n\nChapters 50 and 51 give us the day of reckoning with Babylon for\nthe plunder and destruction of the temple. Jer. 50:4-5 tells us when it\nshall take place. So again 50:20. If we compare the following\npassages, it is clear that all this is yet future. Compare:\n\nJer. 51:13\nwith\n\nRev. 17:1; Rev. 17:15;\nJer. 51:8\nwith\n\nRev. 18:2;\nJer. 51:45\nwith\n\nRev. 18:4;\nJer. 50:13\nwith\n\nRev. 18:19;\nJer. 51:48\nwith\n\nRev. 18:20;\n\nJer. 50:15\n\nwith\n\nRev. 18:22-23;\n\nand we shall see that the judgment is indeed deferred; but, it will\n\nsurely come. God will “watch over” it to bring it to pass, and this is\n\nemphasized and marked by the three words:\n\nShaked-shoked-sheshach.* [Note: See Jer. 25:26; Jer. 51:41.]\nFor the Figure involved in these three words, see under Znigma.\n\nJer. 1:17.-Here there are two Paronomasias which are alternated:-\n\n“Be not dismayed (ugu, techath) at their faces (i6déai,\nmipnehem),\nLest | confound thee (gue, achitcha) before them\n(θά 8[, liphnenem).”\nJer. 6:1.-\"Blow ({]-ἤ |-tiken) in Tekoa (at-lihy, the trumpet.”\nJer. 8:13.-1 will surely (Frid, ahsqph) consume them «Πέδί,\nasiphem).”\nJer. 10:11.-“The gods that have not made (haal; avadb!) the\nheavens and the earth, even they shall perish (6faal; yevadb!) from\nthe earth, and from under these heavens.”\n\nThus is the verse emphasized, and our attention called to it. And\nwhen we look at it we find that, unlike the rest of the prophecies of\nJeremiah, this verse is not written in Hebrew but in Chaldee! It is a\nmessage sent to the Gentiles and their gods by the God of Israel; and,\nlike parts of the book of Daniel which specially relate to the Gentiles,\nand their times, it is in the Gentile and not in the Hebrew tongue.\n\nSee Dan. 2:4-49; Dan. 3:1-30; Dan. 4:1-37; Dan. 5:1-31; Dan.\n\n6:1-28; Dan. 7:1-28.

True\ncircumcision is “to worship God in the spirit, to rejoice in Christ Jesus,\nand to have no confidence in the flesh” (Php. 3:3). It is “of the heart in\nspirit, and not in letter” (Rom. 2:25; Rom. 2:29).\n\nTo go back therefore to ordinances, and to this ordinance, after\nhaving been made free in Christ is mutilation, not true circumcision.\nThe verb κατατέµνειν (katatemnein) is always connected with\nmutilation, see Lev. 21:5. 1Ki. 18:28. Isa. 15:2. Hos. 7:14.\n1Ti. 1:18.-“War a good warfare,” strateian strateuein.\n1Ti. 4:3.-This passage has been referred to under Ellipsis and\nZeugma; but there is a latent Paronomasia in one word that is omitted.\nThe Greek is κωλυόντων (κφΙειοπίφπ), forbidding. This word\nsuggests the other word which is omitted, but is obviously to be\nυπαθιςίοος:-κελευόντων (keleuontdpn), commanding. There is the\ndifference of only one letter between the two words. This is not, of\ncourse, a pure paronomasia as only one of the words is expressed.\n1Ti. 6:5-6.-Where the word porismos, gain, is connected with\npeirasmos, temptation, in verse 9.\n\nHeb. 5:8.-“Though he were a Son yet learned he (ἔμαθεν, emathen)\nobedience by the things which he suffered (ἔποθεν, epathen).”\n\nJam. 5:17.-“With prayer (προσευχῆ, proseuchee) he prayed\n(προσηύξατο, proseeuxato)”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “He prayed\nearnestly.” See Polyptoton.\n',''),(41,41,'parechesls','Mat. 3:9.-“God is able of these stones to raise up children unto\nAbraham.”\n\nHere, there is no Paronomasia either in the Greek or the English,\nbut there is in the Hebrew thought. Hence, these would be this\nParechesis:-\nfadéi (abanim), stones.\nἀᾷ6{ (banim), children.\n\n“God is able of these abanim to raise up banim unto Abraham.”\nMat. 10:30.-“The very hairs of your head are all numbered.” idf,\nmene, and idél, manyan.\nMat. 11:17.-“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced\n(ὠρξήσασθε, dprcheesasthe): we have mourned unto you, and ye\nhave not lamented (ἐκόψασθε, ekopsasthe).\n\nThere is a Homeeoteleuton in these two Greek words but no\nParonomasia. The Parachesis is seen by the Syriac, referring to which\nthe Lord doubtless used. There we see a beautiful example of\nParonomasia, for the word “danced” would be r-auld, rakedton,\nand the word “lamented” would be ff-auld, arkedton.\n\nIn the English it would be:-“We have piped unto you and ye did not\nleap: we have mourned unto you, and ye do not weep.”\n\nMat. 11:29.-“l am meek, and ye shall find rest.”\n\nIn the Peshito we have dé¢ (nich), and décf (n’yacha), and\nbetter still in the Lewis-Codex IFG@¢Eld’ (v’enichkon), ie., / shall\ngive you rest,” i.e., | ат neech and v’eneechk¢pn.\n\nMar. 8:32.-The words of Peter to Jesus are rendered in the Lewis-\nCodex:-“As if he pitied him: be it far from thee.” This is arn, haes;\ncn, chas.\nLuk. 7:41-42.-See Rom. 13:8.\nJoh. 1:5.-“The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness\ncomprehended it not.”\n\nIn Syriac the word “darkness” would be -aé, keval, and\n“comprehend” would be -ἀδ, kabbel.\n\nJoh. 10:1.-“He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold” would\nbe id urn écéif, min tara letora.\nRom. 13:8.-“Owe no man anything but to оуе one another.”\n\nIn the Greek (as in the English) these words are very different: but,\nto a Hebrew, the two words would immediately be, in the mind, ρά\n(Ό, acheb and cla, chab. “Спфу, be debtor to no man, but achBb\none another.” The same is seen in Luk. 7:41-42.\n\nRom. 15:4.-“That we through patience ... might have hope.” This\nwould be naf, sabbar and nlay, subar (from the same root).\n\n“That we through sabbar might have saubar.”\n1Co. 1:23-24.-“We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-\nblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are\ncalled, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the\nwisdom of God.”\n\nHere, there is a beautiful combination of words. By a simple\nchange of letters, the words signify cross, stumbling-block,\nfoolishness, power, and wisdom:-\n\niiéé (maskal) is cross.\n\nJEUIE (michshepl) is stumbling-block.\n\nnéé (sechel) is foolishness.\n\nΔὐδόδ (haschil) is power: ᾖθ., prosperity or success\nresulting from power in doing anything.\n\nuéé (sechel) is wisdom (1Ch. 22:12; 1Ch. 26:14. Pro. 12:8).\n\nSo that the whole passage would sound, in reading, thus:-“We\npreach Christ, maskal, to the Jews michshgpl, and to the Greeks\nsekel, but to them that are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the\nhaschil of God and the sechel of God.”\n2Co. 11:17.-“But as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.”\nHere, foolishness and boasting are (from the same root)-\nAUAEE (hithaltel) and\nAUAIEES (nitheplel).\n(d) With a different sound (but similar sense)\n',''),(42,42,'synonymia','Exo. 1:7.-“And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased, and\nmultiplied.”\nHere, we are impressed with the extraordinary great and rapid\nincrease of Israel in Egypt, on which the Divine Comment in Psa.\n105:24 is, “He increased His People exceedingly.” See also Gen. 46:3;\nDeu. 26:5; Act. 7:17.\n\nThe figure of Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) is combined,\nhere, with Synonymia.\n\nExo. 2:23-25.-“And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the\nbondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason\nof the bondage.”\n\nHere the distress of the People is emphasized; as in the next\nverses the faithfulness of God to His covenant is impressed upon us:\n\n“And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his\ncovenant\n\nwith Abraham,\n\nwith Isaac, and\n\nwith Jacob:\n\nand God looked upon the children of Israel,\nand God had respect unto them.”\nHere we have Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ), in the repetition\nof the word “with”: Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see] ), in the\nrepetition of the word “with,” combined with Synonymia, and all this in\norder to emphasize this remarkable crisis and turning-point of Israel’s\nhistory.\n\nExo. 12:2.-\"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it\nshall be the first month of the year to you.”\n\nThus the important fact of the change of the beginning of the year\nis emphasized. It was no ordinary event; and it is thus impressed upon\nthe People.\n\nExo. 15:16.-“Fear and dread shall fall upon them.”\nExo. 34:6-7.-The import of the name “Jehovah” is revealed by a nine-\nfold synonymous description, which may be thus exhibited:\n\n“Jehovah passed by before him (Moses) and proclaimed Jehovah,\nJehovah, El\n\nmerciful,\n\nand gracious,\n\nlongsuffering\nand abundant in goodness\nand truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands,\nforgiving iniquity,\nand transgression,\nand sin.”\nDeu. 13:4.-“Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him,\nand keep his commandments,\nand obey his voice;\nand ye shall serve him,\nand cleave unto him.”\n\nHere the synonyms are heaped together in order to emphasize the\nsteadfastness with which the people were to follow Jehovah, and to\nimpress them with the perfection demanded by the Law.\n\nWith this is combined Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).\n\nDeu. 20:3.-“Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against\nyour enemies: let not your hearts faint,\nfear not, and\ndo not tremble,\nneither be ye terrified\nbecause of them.”\nPsa. 5:1-2 (2, 3).-\n“Give ear to my words, O Lord,\nConsider my meditation;\nHearken unto the voice of my cry, my King and my God.”\nSo David’s words and meditation and cry and prayer and voice are\nthus emphasized.\nPsa. 6:8-9 (9, 10).-\n“The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping,\nThe Lord hath heard my supplication,\nThe Lord will receive my prayer.”\nHere we have Anaphora (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] ) and Synonymia\nin David\'s prayer, as well as in Jehovah’s hearkening thereto, in order\nto emphasize the great truth conveyed in these two verses.\n\nPsa. 7:14, (15).-\n“Behold he travaileth with iniquity,\nand hath conceived mischief,\nand brought forth falsehood.”\n\nHere we have a double series of synonyms: in the nouns, as well\nas the verbs.\n\nPsa. 7:15 (16).-\n“He made a pit and digged it,\nAnd he is fallen into the ditch which he made.”\nPsa. 8:4 (5).-\n“What is man that thou art mindful of him?\nAnd the son Of man that thou visitest him?\nPsa. 10:17.-\n“Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble:\nThou wilt prepare their heart,\nThou wilt cause Thine ear to hear.”\nHere Synonymia is enforced in the last line by Polyptoton (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).\nPsa. 29:1-2.-\n“Give the Lord, O ye sons of God (i.e., Angels; A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n16141, “mighty”)\nGive the Lord glory and strength.\nGive the Lord the glory due unto His name;\nWorship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.”\nPsa. 32:1-2.-\n“Blessed is he whose trangression is forgiven,\nWhose sin is covered.\nBlessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.”\n\nThese three synonyms must be understood, in order to receive the\nblessing which the figure here announces.\n\n(1) Trangression is our (pesha), from the root, to break, to\nbreak with; hence, to break covenant with, revolt, rebel (see 1Ki.\n12:19; 2Ki. 8:20). When Jehovah says (Isa. 43:27): “Thy teachers\nhave transgressed.” He means they have revolted from Him. So with\nIsa. 1:2.\n(2) Sin is GCFU (chattath), a missing, not hitting the mark (Jdg.\n20:16); also of the feet, to miss the step or footing; and hence,\nstumble; then, to err, go astray, trespass. Every departure from God is,\ntherefore, a missing of the mark, and trespass against Him.\n\n(3) Iniquity is Ald (aven), a bending or curving; then, of actions,\nacting crookedly or perversely. It is generally rendered perverseness.\nSee Isa. 53:5 (where it is rendered iniquities), 6, 11; Jer. 33:8.\n\nThe first of these three words refers specially to thought, the\nsecond to deed, and the third to word.\n\nThe first is “forgiven”: i.e., taken up and carried away (Gen. 27:3\n(take); 58. 53:4 (borne), 12 (bare).\n\nThe second is “covered” by atonement.\n\nThe third is “not imputed”: i.e., not reckoned or counted. Gen.\n50:20 : “Ye thought (or meant) evil against me; but God meant it for\ngood. (Here, we have the same word twice).\n\n“Oh! the blessednessess!\nRebellion forgiven;\nErrings atoned for;\nPerverseness not imputed (or remembered).”\n\nCompare Psa. 103:14 and. Isa. 43:25, where our infirmities which\nman will not remember or make allowance for, God remembers, but\nour sins and iniquities which man always remembers, God will\nremember no more for ever.\n\nPsa. 89:30-31 (34, 32).-\n“If his children forsake my law,\nAnd walk not in my judgments;\n\nIf they break my statutes,\n\nAnd keep not my commandments.”\n\nHere the Synonymia is alternated (positive and negative); together\nwith alternated Anaphora.\n\nPro. 4:14-15.-Here, the synonyms are heaped together to emphasize\nthe necessity, of avoiding all evil and evil persons.\n“Enter not into the path of the wicked,\nAnd go not in the way of evil men;\n\nAvoid it,\n\nPass not by it,\n\nTurn from it,\n\nAnd pass away.”\nIsa. 1:4.-Here, four synonymous descriptions are used to give some\nestimate of Israel\'s condition. See under Anabasis and Ejphonesis.\nIsa. 2:11-17.-We have already seen under the figure of Polysyndeton\n(q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), how this passage is emphasised both by\nthat figure and by its structure.\n\nWe have now to note the bearing of another figure upon it: viz.,\nSynonymia. But the use of this figure, the Synonyms are heaped\ntogether in order still further to attract our attention; and to impress as\nwith the importance and emphasis, which the Holy Spirit would have\nus give to this Scripture; in which “the Day of the Lord” is first\nmentioned, and in which the essence of its meaning and character is\ngiven.\nThere are two classes of words-a kind of double Synonymia-going\non at the same time: one marking the pride of man and the true\nexaltation of the Lord, which shall mark that Day, and the other the\nabasement of man which shall then take place.\n\nIsa. 2:11. The lofty (aaa, gavah) looks of man shall be\nhumbled (1106, shaphel),\nAnd the haughtiness (li, rum) of men shall be bowed\ndown (ga, shachach),\nAnd the Lord alone shall be exalted (uaa, sagav) in that\nday.\nIsa. 2:12. For the Day of the Lord of hosts shail be upon every\none that is proud (afa, gaach) and lofty (i i, rum),\nAnd upon every one (or thing) that is lifted up (dur,\nnahsah);\nAnd he shall be brought low (udé, shaphel):\nIsa. 2:13. And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high\n(i rum) and lifted up (dur, nasa),\nAnd upon all the oaks of Bashan,\nIsa. 2:14. And upon all the high ili, rum) mountains,\nAnd upon all the hills that are lifted up (duit nasa),\nIsa. 2:15. And upon every high (aaa, gavah) tower,\nAnd upon every fenced wall,\nIsa. 2:16. And upon all the ships of Tarshish,\nAnd upon all pleasant pictures.\nIsa. 2:17. And the loftiness (daa, navah) of man shall be\nbowed down (uaa, shachah),\nAnd the haughtiness li, rum) of men shall be made low\n(UGE, shaphen):\nAnd the Lord alone shall be exalted (uaa, sagav) in that\nday.”\nHere we have five words for high repeated fourteen times; and two\nwords for {ουν repeated five times.\nThe five:-\naaa (gavah). Three times: lofty, verse 11; high, verse 15;\nloftiness, verse 17 (in R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] ‚ verses 11 and 15, lofty; in verse 17, loftiness),\ntli (rum). Five times: haughtiness, verses 11, 17; lofty, verse\n12 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , haughty);\nhigh, verses 13, 14 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n18841, high).\nwaa (sagav). Twice: exalted, verses 11, 17 (so R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] ).\nafa (gaah). Once: proud, verse 12 (so R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] ).\ndtr (nasa). Three times: lifted up, verses 12, 13, 14 (so R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).\nThe two:-\nudé (shaphel). Three times: humbled, verse 11; brought low,\nverse 12; made low, verse 17 (R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , brought low).\nἧςς (shachach). Twice: bowed down, verses 11, 17 (so R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).\nThese two words occur also in verse 9.\nIt will be seen that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has quite destroyed the figure\nby its variety of rendering. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] has evidently aimed at more uniformity, and has preserved one\nEnglish word for each Hebrew word, except in two cases, where in\nverses 13 and 14 they have rendered ili (rum), high, and in 11, 17,\nhaughtiness, and 12, haughty. “Haughty” could hardly be used of trees\nand mountains, but “high” could have been used of men, and thus\nhave made the translation uniform.\n\nThis is the first occurrence of the expression “the day of the Lord,”\nand hence its definition is thus given and thus emphasized by the\nfigure of Synonymia.\n\nThe structure of the definition lends weight and solemnity to the\ndescription:\n\nА — 11. Definition of the Day. “Man” and “Men” brought low, and\n\nGod alone exalted.\nВ 12. Persons (every one).\nВ 13-16. Things (every thing).\nА — 17. Definition of the Day. “Man” and “Men” brought low, and\nGod alone exalted.\nThe order of the words too in A and A is remarkable. In connection\nwith the loftiness of man they are arranged alternately.\nverse 11.\nAa aaa (gavah),\nb ἥί (rum),\nverse 17.\nAa aaa (gavah),\nb ἥί (rum),\nWhile in the humbling of man they are arranged in an Epanodos\n(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] )\nverse 11.\nΑ ο ὑἡὑδδ (shaphel),\nа UGG (shachach),\nverse 17.\nA d UGG (shachach),\nο udé (shaphel),\nIsa. 52:13.-“Behold my servant ... shall be exalted, and extolled, and\nbe very high.”\n\nThus the future exaltation of the Messiah is emphasized.\n\nJer. 13:17.-“But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret\nplaces for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down\nwith tears, because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive.”\n\nThis sorrow of the prophet thus emphasized was seen in greater\nsolemnity when the Saviour in later days wept over Jerusalem (Luk.\n19:41).\n\nJer. 48:29.-“We have heard the pride of Moab,\n(he is exceeding proud),\nhis loftiness,\nand his arrogancy,\nand his pride,\nand the haughtiness of his heart.”\nHere is a six-fold Synonymia combined with Parenthesis (q.v.\n[Note: Which see.] ) and Polysyndeton. And all to exhibit the terrible\npride of Moab which was to be punished. Compare Isa. 16:6.\n\nNah. 2:11-12 (12, 13).-\n“Where is the dwelling of the lions,\nAnd the feeding place of the young lions,\nWhere the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s\nwhelp,\nAnd none made them afraid?\nThe lion did tear them in pieces enough for his whelps,\nAnd strangled for his lionesses,” etc.\nZep. 1:15.-“That day is\na day of wrath,\na day of trouble\nand distress,\na day of wasteness\nand desolation,\na day of darkness,\nand gloominess,\na day of clouds\nand thick darkness.”\n\nHere these Synonyms are heaped up to impress the wicked with\nthe terrors of “that day.” This is further heightened by being combined\nwith the figures: Epizeuxis (q.v. [Note: Which see] ), verse 14,\nMesarchia (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ), Mesadiplosis (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee.] ), Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), and Asyndeton (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).\n\nZep. 2:9.-Moab and Ammon shall be as Sodom and Gomorrah,\n“aven the breeding of nettles,\nand saltpits,\nand a perpetual desolation.”\nMar. 12:30.-“And thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart,\nand with all thy soul,\nand with all thy mind,\nand with all thy strength.”\n\nThus is the first and great commandment emphasized by the\ncombined figures of Homoeoteleuton (q.v. [Note: Which see] ),\nPolysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), and Synonymia, in order to\nconvict us of the impossibility of keeping this law and to bring us to the\nfeet of Christ, who alone could keep it: that so we might be impressed\nwith a sense of our own impotence, and cause us thankfully to cast\nourselves on His omnipotence (see Luk. 10:27).\n\nLuk. 10:27.-See Mar. 12:30.\nAct. 2:23.-“Counsel and foreknowledge, Crucified and\nslain.”\nRom. 2:4.-“Or despisest thou the riches of His\ngoodness,\nand forbearance,\nand longsuffering?”\nHere Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) is combined with\nSynonymia.\nRom. 2:7.-“To them who by patient continuation in well-doing seek for\nglory,\nand honour,\nand immortality,\n[He will give] eternal life.”\nSee under Ellipsis.\nRom. 2:8-9.-“But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the\ntruth, but obey unrighteousness, [will be rendered]\nindignation and\nwrath,\ntribulation, and\nanguish.”\nSee under Ellipsis.\nRom. 2:10.-“But glory, honour, and peace [will be rendered] to every\nman that worketh good, etc.”\nSee under Ellipsis.\nRom. 2:18-20.-In these verses the synonyms are heaped together to\ndescribe the Jew who causes the Name of God to be blasphemed\namong the Gentiles (verse 24).\nRom. 6:6.-“Knowing this that our old man is (was) crucified with him\n(Christ), that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we\nshould not serve sin.”\nHere all three terms refer, by the figure of Synonymia, to different\naspects of the same thing:\nThe “old man” expresses the origin in Adam.\nBy reason of its powers and operations it is called “the body of\nsin,” or sinful body.\nAnd, lastly, its very nature and character is expressed by the name\nof “sin.”\nRom. 9:33.-“Stumbling-stone and rock of offence.”\nRom. 10:15.-“Gospel of peace, and ... glad tidings of good things.”\n1Co. 14:21.-“With men of other tongues and other lips, etc.”\nGal. 1:12.-“For | neither received it of man, neither was | taught it,\nbut by the revelation of Jesus Christ.”\n\nThus is emphasized the special commission which Paul received\ndirect from God; and thus is it distinguished from that commission\nwhich had been given to the Twelve.\nGal. 5:19-21.-The works of the flesh are emphasized by sixteen\nsynonyms, and by the figure of Asyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see-_] ).\nEph. 1:20-21.-To describe the exaltation of Christ we are told how He\nhas been set “Far above all\n\nprincipality,\n\nand power,\n\nand might,\n\nand dominion,\n\nand every name that is named,” etc.\nEph. 5:19.-Here the three synonyms, “Psalms, and hymns, and\nspiritual songs,” are used to emphasize the true inward and spiritual\noccupation of the heart with Christ, which is at once the result of being\n“filled with the Spirit” (verse 18), and the test or the measure of being\nso filled.\n\nIt may be well to define these synonyms: Ψαλμός (psalmos)\nmeans a touching, then a touching of an instrument with a “plectrum.”\nψάλλω (рзайф), the verb, means to sweep the strings. So that the\nnoun was used first of the instrument, and then of the song\naccompanied by it. It is used seven times in the New Testament, and\nfour times of the Book of Psalms (Luk. 20:42; Luk. 24:44. Act. 1:20;\nAct. 13:33), and three times of psalms generally (1Co. 14:26. Eph.\n5:19. Col. 3:16). This points to the conclusion that the psalms referred\nto here are the inspired Psalms of the Old Testament.\n\nὕμνος (hymnos), whence our word “hymn,” which was originally a\nheathen word used of a song in praise of a god or hero after death.\nThe word was so steeped in profane and idolatrous associations that\nthe early Christians hesitated to use it, and it was not till the fourth\ncentury that it came to be generally adopted. But then it was\nstudiously confined to a direct address of praise and glory to the true\nand living God; whereas the Psalm might commemorate the mercies\nand blessings He bestowed. It occurs only here and Col. 3:16. The\nverb ὑμνέω (hymned) occurs four times (Mat. 26:30. Mar. 14:26. Act.\n16:25, and Heb. 2:12). The latter two passages fully confirm the\nlimited use of the word: “And sang praises unto God” (Act. 16:25).\n“Will | sing praise unto Thee” (Heb. 2:12), while the former two would\nrefer to the Old Testament Psalms always sung at the Passover.\n\nᾠδή (фаее), whence our word “ode,” occurs seven times,* [Note:\nThe verb dwt (ad › ) occurs five times (Eph. 5:19. Col. 3:16. Rev. 5:9;\nRev. 14:3; Rev. 15:3).] five in the Apocalypse, and two in the Epistles\n(Eph. 5:19, and Col. 3:16), where it is specially combined with\nπνευματική (pneumatikee) spiritual, implying very strongly that they\nwere composed by spiritual persons, and had to do only with the\nthings pertaining to the Spirit of God. The heathen used it of any kind\nof song: harvest, festal, wedding, or battle, etc. Hence the limitation\nsuggested by the word “spiritual,” as distinct from these.\n\nAlthough the first word, psalmos, implies musical instruments, it\nwas only in Old Testament worship that these were used: not in the\nNew Testament, nor in the Primitive Church. Basil, Ambrose, and\nChrysostom all speak in panegyrics on music, but do not mention\ninstrumental music. Indeed, Clement of Alexandria, forbade the use of\nthe flute in the Agape, though he permitted the harp. Basil condemns\nit, and Justin Martyr expressly says that it was not used in the\nChristian Church.\n\nThere is no gift of God which fallen man has not misused, and\nindeed diverted, or rather perverted from its original design. The great\nenemy uses it for the destruction of spiritual worship, under the guise\nof aiding it; and few discern the meshes of his marvellously clever\nsnare.t [Note: See Intoned Prayers and Musical Services, by the\nsame author and publisher. One penny.]\nMusic and singing are clearly defined in these two passages Eph.\n5:19 and Col. 3:16. The three verbs are “speaking,” “teaching,” and\n“admonishing.” This is to be done “to yourselves,” “in you,” “in your\nhearts,” “admonishing yourselves” (ἑαυτούς, heautous), not “one\nanother” (see R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin). The\ngreat requirement for this is “the Spirit” and “all wisdom” and “grace.”\n\nThe words “be filled with the Spirit* [Note: It will be seen, under the\nFigure of Metonymy, that the word “Spirit” here (as in several other\npassages) is put for the gifts of the Spirit.) ” are usually quoted as\nthough they were followed by a full stop, and formed a complete\nsentence. This is not the case. How is any one to know whether he is\nfilled with the Spirit? The answer is given:-\n\n“The word of Christ” will dwell in him richly: i.e., the word spoken\nby Christ and the word relating to Christ: the word which has Christ for\nits object and Christ for its subject, or Christ Himself “by” (ἐν, en) the\nSpirit.\n\nThis indwelling of Christ will be the evidence of the Holy Spirit’s\npresence and operation. For the Spirit and the Word can never be\nseparated. He gives it; and He uses it, and operates through it. It is\nHis work to take of the things of Christ and show them unto us, and\nthus to “glorify” Christ; never calling our attention to His work in us, but\nto Christ’s work for us.\n\nWhen this word thus dwells in us, we shall be full of its wondrous\nPsalms; we shall be speaking in ourselves to God, by our hymns: and\nour songs will be spiritual, because they will be sung in our hearts.\nThere will be the melody which ascends and reaches up to the\nPresence of God: because it will be a “singing by grace and with grace\nunto God.”\n\nThis occupation of the heart with Christ and His Word will be the\nmeasure in which we are filled with the Spirit (i.e., with spiritual gifts).\n\nIt will be the singing of the “heart,” and not of the throat: and it will\nbe “to the praise and glory of God” (as it used to be) and not to the\npraise and glory of the choir or of the performers. The heart which is\nindwelt by the Spirit, can sing to God. It will need no “soloist” to do it\nby proxy. For we are not commanded to listen to the singing of\nanother or others, however exquisite it may be, but to sing ourselves\nas worshippers. This singing requires no “ear for music,” but it needs a\n“heart” for Christ. For this music comes from God and returns to God.\n\nIn the Word of God, prayer is always spoken, and never sung:-\n\n“Moses besought the Lord, saying” (Deu. 3:23; Exo. 32:11, etc.).\n“Manoah intreated the Lord), and said” (Jdg. 13:8).\n\n“Hannah prayed, and said” (1Sa. 2:1).\n\n“Elisha prayed, and said” (2Ki. 6:17).\n\n“Daniel prayed, and made confession, and said’ (Dan. 9:4; Dan.\n9:20).\n\nIndeed prayer is contrasted with praise, for “Solomon spread forth\nhis hands towards heaven, and said’ (1Ki. 8:22-23; 1Ki. 8:54). But\nwhen it is a question of praise then we read that it was made with\nmusic and singing. (2Ch. 5:12-13).\n\nIn the upper room the Lord and His apostles “sang a hymn” (Mat.\n26:30); but when in Gethsemane “He fell on his face and prayed,\nsaying” (verse 39).\n\nIn Jam. 5:13 they are again set in contrast: “Is any among you\nafflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.”\nThis universal testimony of Scripture settles for us the question as\nto the distinction between prayer embodied in hymns and prayer sung\ninstead of said. That testimony of Scripture is dead against the singing\nof prayers in any form or manner. It draws no distinction between\nintoning prayers and singing them. Intoning is singing, and nothing\nelse: it is merely singing on one note instead of many. It is art and\nartificial; it is unnatural and unreal-neither pleasing to God nor edifying\nfor man.\n\nPublic worship is that in which the Word of God should be read,\nprayers prayed, and praise sung. God’s Word we read, not as our\nown, but as His, for our instruction. In prayer and praise we say and\nsing our own words, as our own. It is therefore no argument to urge\nthat the Psalms were sung and they contain prayers. For\n\n(1) We do not admit the first premises. Too little is known to justify\nthe assertion that all the Psalms were sung. Some were, undoubtedly;\nand these may be sung by us to-day, if we can adopt the words as our\nown; but not otherwise.\n\n(2) We cannot adopt the words of all the Psalms as our own, but\nonly so far as they are in harmony with the New Testament teaching\nas to our standing in Christ. The language of those which were under\nthe Old Covenant of Works cannot be adopted as the language of\nthose who are under the New Covenant of Grace.\n\nWe may read them as we read the other Scriptures for our\ninstruction, but we might just as well sing the Lessons as sing some of\nthe Psalms.\n\nAgain we repeat, therefore, the other New Testament Rubrick-“Is\nany afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing Psalms” (Jam.\n5:13); and we conclude that prayer is to be said, and praise is to be\nsung. Praise may even be said; for three times are songs said to be\nspoken. The Song of Moses (Deu. 31:30); the Song of Deborah (Jdg.\n5:12); and the Song of David (2Sa. 22:1; Psa. 18:1-50 Title). But, while\npraise may be spoken, prayer is never said to be sung.\n\nInstead, therefore, of flying in the face of the universal testimony of\nScripture, simply because prayer is embodied by human poets in our\nhymns, we ought rather to question whether the prayer in hymns\nshould not be said, and only our hymns of praise sung. But habits\nonce formed are too strong for us to entertain the hope of making so\nradical a reformation; though it would be better, if not easier, to alter a\nwrong habit than to alter the testimony of the Word of God.\n\nPhp. 4:9.-“Those things which ye have both learned,\nand received,\nand heard,\n\nand seen in me, do.”\nCol. 1:16.-“For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and\nthat are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or\ndominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by\nhim, and for him.”\n\nHere we are impressed with the wonders of the invisible world, of\nwhich so little is revealed.\n\nCol. 3:16.-See Eph. 5:19.\n1Ti. 1:2.-“Grace, mercy, and peace.”\n\nSo also in the other two so-called “Pastoral Epistles,” 2Ti. 1:2, and\nTit. 2:4.\n\nIn all the other epistles it is only “grace,” or “grace and peace.” In\nthese three epistles “mercy” is added: as though to imply that with the\nmany responsibilities of the pastoral office, God’s “mercy” would be\nspecially needed by those who exercised pastoral duties in the Church\nof God.\n1Ti. 3:15.-“That thou mayest know how thou oughtest (Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] , how men ought) to behave thyself [or what\nconduct is incumbent on us] in\n\nthe house of God,\n\nwhich is the Church of the living God,\n\nthe pillar and ground of the truth.”\nWhat this is is shown in the next verse, viz., the “great secret”\nconcerning Christ Mystical and not Christ Personal.* [Note: See The\nMystery, by the same author and publisher.\n\nSee also under Hendiadys.]\n\nThis great Mystery is the Body of Christ, the House in which God\ndwells by His Spirit; the assembly of the saints peculiarly belonging to\nthe living God, as purchased with the blood of the everlasting\ncovenant; and this is the pillar and ground-the great foundation pillar\nof the truth, so specially revealed to Paul to make known among the\nGentiles.\n2Ti. 1:2.-See 1Ti. 1:2.\n2Ti. 3:14-15.-“But continue thou in the things which thou\nhast learned and\nhast been assured of, knowing of whom thou\nhast learned them. And that from a child thou\nhast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise,\netc.”\n\nHere the importance of personal knowledge and study of the word\nof God is enforced: not a mere acquaintance with the letter, but an\nassurance of the truth.\nTit. 1:4.-See 1Ti. 1:2.',''),(43,43,'repeatednegation','This difference may be seen in such passages as 1Co. 2:14 (οὐ).\nJoh. 3:18, where we have οὐ in the first sentence, and µή (both times)\nin the second.\n\nMat. 22:29.-“Ye do err not (µή, mee), knowing the Scriptures.” Here\nthe µή (mee) denies subjectively, not absolutely, implying that though\nthey did actually know the letter, they did not wish to know their truth.\n\nWhen however they and their compounds, οὐδὲ µή (oude mee),\nand οὖδε οὐ µή (oude ou mee), are used together, this difference is\nsunk, and the combination produces a most solemn and emphatic\nasseveration.\n\nIndeed, so strong is it, that whenever man used it the result always\nbelied it. See:-\n\nMat. 16:22 : where Peter says “This shall not be unto thee.” But it\nwas.\nJoh. 13:8 : Peter says again, “Thou shalt never wash my feet.” But\nChrist did.\nMat. 26:35 : where Peter affirms “I will not deny thee.” But he did.\nJoh. 20:25 : Thomas says, “Except | shall see, etc., | will not believe.”\nBut he did.\n\nOn the other hand, our Lord often used this figure: and, whenever\nHe did so, He always made it good:-\nMat. 5:18.-“Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle* [Note: This\nis a little ornament something like a fleur-de-lis over certain letters.\nThe Hebrew name for this is Taag, or little crown (plural Taagim). The\nGreek is ё:5\\ (keraia), a little horn, which is exactly what the Taag is.\nSee The Massorah, by the same author and publisher, One Shilling.\nThe jot or yod is the smallest letter of the alphabet. For full information\non this subject see Dr. Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Hebrew Bible,\npublished by the Trinitarian Bible Society.] shall in no wise pass from\nthe law, etc.” Here we have the certainty of Divine Truth.\n\nMat. 5:20.-“Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness\nof the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.” Here we have the absolute necessity of Divine\nrighteousness.\n\nMat. 5:26.-“Thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast\npaid the uttermost farthing.” Here we have the inflexibility of Divine\njustice.\n\nMat. 13:14.-As in Act. 28:26, we have here the solemn announcement\nconcerning Israel\'s judicial blindness, emphasising and strengthening\nits certainty.\n\nMat. 16:28.-The certainty of His promise as to the manifestation of His\ncoming glory (see 17:1-5, and 2Pe. 1:16-18).\nMat. 18:3.-The absolute necessity of conversion.\nMat. 23:39.-The certainty of His words concerning the conditions as to\nHis return.\nMat. 24:2.-Completeness of the overthrow and dismemberment of the\nTemple.\nMat. 24:21.-The greatness of the tribulation.\nMat. 24:34.-The fact that when once these things begin to come to\npass (γέηται, not πληρόω, compare Luk. 21:24; Luk. 21:32), that\ngeneration which sees the abomination of desolation set up (verse 15)\nshall see “all these things” come to pass.\nMat. 24:35.-The inviolability of Christ’s words.\n\nMat. 26:29.-The certitude of Christ\'s pledge (Mar. 14:25.

Simple\n1. Synonymous or Gradational\nThis is when the lines are parallel in thought, and in the use of\nsynonymous words.\nThe oldest example, and the first in the Bible, is in\nGen. 4:23-24.-In these oldest human poetic lines Lamech celebrates\nthe invention of weapons of war: and it is significant that this should be\nthe first subject of poetry! Lamech’s son was “an instructor of every\nartificer in brass and iron,” and the injury of others was the earliest\napplication of the art.\n\nLamech is so elated with that which would give him power among\nmen that he at once breaks out in eulogy; and boasts that if any one\ninjures him, he would outdo even Jehovah in His punishment of those\nwho should injure Cain.\n\nThere are three pairs of lines, and the synonymous words will be\nat once seen, as we have exhibited them:-\n\n“Adah and Zillah hearken to my voice;\nYe wives of Lamech listen to my speech.\nFor | can slay a man, if he injures me,\nAnd a young man, if he hurts me.\n\nIf Cain shall be avenged seven-fold,\nTruly Lamech [shall be avenged]* [Note: See under\nEllipsis.] seventy-seven-fold.”\nLuk. 1:46-47.-\n“My soul doth magnify the Lord,\nAnd my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.”\nPsa. 1:1.-“Blessed is the man\nthat walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,\nnor standeth in the way of sinners,\nnor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.”\nHere, we have three series of gradation:-\nWalketh,\nstandeth,\nsitteth,\nCounsel,\nway,\nseat.\nUngodly,\nsinners,\nscornful.\n\nThese gradations point us to the fact that there is a mine of truth\ncontained in the verse, on which a volume might be written.\n\nThe tenses also have their lessons for us too, for they imply “that\nnever did walk ... stand ... sit’: and so help to teach us that in this first\nPsalm David speaketh “concerning”: i.e., “with an ultimate reference\nto” (εἰς, eis), “Christ” (See Act. 2:25). In fact, this first Psalm speaks of\nChrist as the one perfect Man; while the second speaks of Him as the\none perfect King: (“the model Shepherd,” He Himself says He is: ©\nποιμὴν © καλός (Πο poimeen ho kalos), not simply © καλὸς ποιµήν (Πο\nkalos poimeen): and then twice over at least (see Joh. 10:11; Joh.\n14:1-31); and so, too, is He the “model” Man and the “model” King.\n2. Antithetic, or Opposite\nThis is when the words are contrasted in the two or more lines, being\nopposed in sense the one to the other.\nPro. 10:1.-\n“A wise son maketh a glad father;\nBut a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother”\nPro. 27:6.-\n“Faithful are the wounds of a friend,\nBut deceitful are the kisses of an enemy”\n3. Synthetic, or Constructive\nThis is where the parallelism consists only in the similar form of\nconstruction:-\nPsa. 19:7-9.-\n“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul:\nThe testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.\nThe statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart:\nThe commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.\nThe fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever:\nThe judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether”\nHere, there is neither gradation nor opposition of words in the\nseveral lines; which are independent, and depend for their parallelism\non their construction.\nIn all the above cases the lines are simply parallel, and are chiefly\nin pairs.\nWhen the parallelism appears in four or more lines, then it may be\ncalled\nIl. Complex\n1. Alternate\nThis is when the lines are placed alternately. In this case, the first and\nthird lines, and the second and fourth lines, may, as a rule, be read\ncontinuously, while the intervening line is thus placed in a parenthesis.\nThese alternate lines may be either synonymous or antithetic.\nGen. 19:25.-\nа “The cities (and He overthrew)\nЬ — The plain (and all the plain),\nа — The inhabitants of the cities,\nЬ — The produce of the plain.”\nDeu. 32:21.-\na “They have moved me to jealousy\nЬБ — with that which is not God:\nа — They have provoked me to anger\nb_ with their vanities:\nο And! will move them to jealousy\n@ — with those which are not a people:\nο | will provoke them to anger\nа with a foolish nation.”\nDeu. 32:42.-Here a and a are continuous, and likewise b and b. They\nmust be so read, thus dispensing with the italics. The line b we give\nfrom the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nа “I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,\nb — апа my sword shall devour much flesh;\nа with the blood of the slain and of the captives,\nЬ from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”\nHere a and a relate to the arrows, while b and b refer to the sword.\n1Ch. 21:22.-\nа — Request. “Grant me the place of this threshingfloor.”\nЬ Design. “That I may build an altar therein unto the Lord.”\nа Request. “Thou shalt grant it me for the full price.”\nЬ Design. “That the plague may be stayed from the people.”\nHere a and a are continuous, likewise b and b. We must read on\nfrom Ь to b, placing a in a parenthesis. This shows that the plague was\nstayed, not because David paid the full price for the place, but\nbecause of the atoning sacrifice which he offered.\nEst. 8:5.\nа — The king. “If it please the king.”\nЬ Esther’s personal influence. “And if 1 have found favour.”\nа — The king. “And the thing seem right before the king.”\nb Esther’s personal influence. “And | be pleasing in his\neyes.”\nPro. 18:24, -The parallel here is lost owing to an obscurity in the\nHebrew. The Massorah records that the word ru (osh) (which has\nbeen taken by translators as another spelling of réu (eesh), а man)\nis put three times* [Note: The other two passages are 2Sa. 14:19\n(where the sense is unaffected, “If there is any that turn” meaning\n“none can turn”), and Mic. 6:10, where the reading called Sevir which\nis equal in authority to the Keri, is boldly adopted into the Text by both\nthe A.V. and the R.V. “Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the\nhouse of the wicked,” etc.] for éu (yesh), there is.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] avoids the italics of\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] which are put in to make some sort of sense owing to\nthe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] having taken 6A UrIAN trom the wrong root (ha, to\nfeed), instead of ma, to break). So that instead of meaning to make\nfriends, it means (as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] )\nto be broken in pieces. Hence, to ruin oneself.\n\nThe point and the parallel, therefore, lies in the plural “friends”: i.e.,\nor many friends in contrast with the faithfulness of the one “friend”:-\n\nа “There are “friends\n\nb — Ю our own detriment:\nа But there is a friend\nЬ that sticketh closer than a brother.”\nSee under Paronomasia.\nPro. 24:19-20.\nа “Fret not thyself because of evil men,\nb neither be thou envious at the wicked;\nа For there shall be no reward to the evil man;\nЬ The candle of the wicked shall be put out.”\nIsa. 1:29-30.-\na “For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have\ndesired,\nЬ — And ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have\nchosen.\nа Forye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth,\nЬ And asa garden that hath no water.”\nIsa. 9:10.-\nа “The bricks are fallen down,\nb but we will build with hewn stones:\nа — The sycomores are cut down,\nЬ — Виё we will change them into cedars.”\nIsa. 14:26-27.-\nа “This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth:\nb And this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the\nnations,\nа For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul\nit?\nЬ — And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?”\nIsa. 17:7-8.-\nа “At that day shall a man look to his Maker,\nЬ — апа his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel,\nа And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,\nЬ neither shall respect that which his fingers have made:”\nIsa. 18:6.-\nа Fowls. “They shall be left, etc.”\nЬ Beasts. “And to the beasts, etc.”\nа Fowls. “And the fowls, etc.”\nЬ Beasts. “And all the beasts, etc.”\nIsa. 31:3.-\nа “The Egyptians are men,\nЬ — апа not God:\nа And their horses flesh,\nЬ — апа not spirit.”\nSee under Pleonasm.\nIsa. 34:6.-Here the first and third lines are continuous, as are also the\nsecond and fourth lines.\nа “The sword of the Lord is filled with blood,\nЬ — itis made fat with fatness,\nа and with the blood of lambs and goats,\nЬ — with the fat of the kidneys of rams.”\nIsa. 51:20 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).-Here a and a,\nand b and b must be read together in order to catch the sense.\nа “Thy sons have fainted,\nЬ they lie [[6., are cast down]\nа at the top of all the streets,\nЬ — а5 an antelope in a net.”\nIsa. 59:5-6.-\nа “They hatch cockatrice’ eggs,\nЬ — ап{ weave the spide’s web;\nа — Не that eateth of their eggs dieth ..\nЬ — Their webs shall not become garments.”\nIsa. 61:4.-\nа “And they shall build the old wastes,\nЬ ἍΤΠΘΥ shall raise up the former desolations,\nа and they shall repair the waste cities,\nЬ — The desolations of many generations.”\nSee also under Epanodos, Antimetabole, and Chiasmos.\n2. Repeated Alternation\nThis is not confined to two alternate lines repeated, making four lines\nin all, as in the preceding examples; but in the repetition of the two\nparallel subjects in several lines.\nIsa. 65:21-22.-\nа1 “And they shall build houses,\nb1 and inhabit them;\nа2 And they shall plant vineyards,\nb2 and eat the fruit of them.\na3 They shall not build,\nb3 and another inhabit;\na4 They shall not plant,\nb4 and another eat.”\nOr, these may be arranged in four longer alternate lines, thus:-\nPositive.\nа Houses (they shall build),\nЬ Vineyards (they shall plant).\nNegative.\nа — Houses (they shall not build),\nЬ — Vineyards (they shall not plant).\nWhere the first two lines are positive and the last negative.\n1Jn. 2:15-16.-\na1 “If any man love the world,\nb1 the love of the Father is not in him,\na2 For all that is in the world.\nb2 is not of the Father,\n83 but is of the world.”\n3. Extended Alternation\nThe Scriptures abound with other illustrations of the arrangement of\nalternate parallel lines.\nBut these alternate lines may consist not merely of two pairs, or of\nfour lines; or, of repeated alternations: the alternation may be\nextended. That is to say, the alternation may be extended so as to\nconsist of three or more lines.\nJdg. 10:17.-\nа “Then the children of Ammon\nЬ — меге gathered together,\nс — апа encamped in Gilead.\nа And the children of Israel\nb assembled themselves together,\nο. and encamped in Mizpeh.”\nMat. 6:19-20.-\nа “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\nЬ — where moth and rust doth corrupt,\nс — апа where thieves break through and steal:\na But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\nЬ — where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,\nс — апа where thieves do not break through nor steal.”\nSee under Epibole.\n4. Introverted Parallelisms\nThis is when the parallel lines are so placed that if there be six lines,\nthe first corresponds with the sixth, the second with the fifth, and the\nthird with the fourth.\nWhen this Introversion consists only of words and of the same\nwords, it is called Epanodos (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\nWhen Propositions are introverted, it is called Antimetabole (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).\nWhen Subjects are introverted, it is called Chiasmus (see under\nCorrespondence).\nGen. 3:19.-\nа End. “Till thou return unto the ground.”\nb Origin. “For out of it was thou taken.”\nЬ Origin. “For dust thou art.”\nа End. “And unto dust shalt thou return.”\nExo. 9:31.-\nа “And the flax\nb — апа the barley was smitten:\nЬ — For the barley was in the ear,\nа and the flax was bolled.”\nNum. 15:35-36.-\nа “And the Lord said unto Moses,\nЬ The man shall be surely put to death:\nο they shall stone him with stones,\n4 — а! the congregation without the camp.\nа And they brought him forth, all the congregation\nwithout the camp,\nс — апа stoned him with stones,\nЬ — апа he died;\nа — as the Lord commanded Moses.”\nDeu. 32:16.-\nа “They provoked Him to jealousy\nЬ — with strange gods:\nЬ — with abominations\nа provoked they Him to anger.”\nThis shows that when “abominations” are spoken of, idols are\nmeant.\n188. 1:2.-\nа “The name of the one was Hannah,\nb — апа the name of the other was Peninnah:\nЬ And Peninnah had children,\nа but Hannah had no children.”\n2Sa. 3:1.-\nа — “Now there was long war between the house of Saul\nb — апа the house of David:\nЬ but [the house ой David waxed stronger and stronger,\nа — And the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.”\n1ΚΙ. 16:22.-\nа “But the people that followed Omri prevailed\nb against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath:\nЬ — So Tibni died,\nа and Omri reigned.”\n2Ch. 32:7-8.-\na Our resource. “There be more with us.”\nЬ — Нб resource. “Than with him.”\nЬ His resource. “With him is an arm of flesh.”\na Our resource. “But with us is the Lord our God.”\nPsa. 76:1.-\nа “In Judah\nЬ — & God known:\nЬ — His name is great\nа In Israel.”\nThis shows how “the Name” of God stands, and is put for God\nHimself.

The Aleph (ὢ\nbeing similar in sound with Ayin (A) was easily exchanged by\ntranscribers. And the Parallelism shows beyond doubt that this is the\ncase here.* [Note: This is from the ms. notes for the second edition of\nDr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible.]\n\nIsa. 50:1.-\nа “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, whom | have\nput away?\nbor which of my creditors is it to whom | have sold you?\nЬ Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves,\n\nа — And for your transgressions is your mother put away.”\n\nIsa. 51:8-9.-\n\nа “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\nЬ Neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord,\nЬ — For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so aremy\n\nways higher than your ways,\n\nа and my thoughts than your thoughts.”\n\nHere the whole paragraph is introverted. In a and a we have\n“thoughts,” in b and b we have “ways.” But the pronouns in a and a\nare alternate as to the “thoughts”:-\n\nο ΜΥ thoughts.\n\n4 Your thoughts.\nο ΜΥ thoughts.\nа Your thoughts.\nWhile they are introverted in b and b as to the “ways”:-\nе Your ways.\nf My ways.\n# Myways.\nе Your ways.\nFurther we may note that a and b are negative; and b and a are\npositive.\nIsa. 60:1-3.-\nа “Arise,\nЬ Shine; for thy light is come,\nс — апа the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\n@ — For behold darkness shall cover the earth,\n@ and gross darkness the people:\nο but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall\nbe seen upon thee.\nЬ And the Gentiles shall come to thy light,\nа and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”\nAll these structures may be described, as well as set forth in full.\nThus:-\nа The rising of Israel. (“Rising up.”)\nЬ The Light received.\nο The glory of the Lord.\n@ The darkness of the earth.\nа The darkness of the peoples.\nс The glory of the Lord.\nЬ — The Light reflected.\nа -The rising of Israel.

See under Correspondence. Hence, it relates to Jew\nand Gentile as such; and consequently it is not to be interpreted of the\nChurch, the standing of which is so clearly set forth in chapter 8.

Alternate Correspondence of Subjects\n\nThis is when the subjects of the alternate members correspond with\neach other, either by way of similiarity or contrast.\n\nWe now give a few examples selected from all parts of Scripture.\n\n1.

In this case the first member of the first\nseries corresponds with the first member of the second, while the\nsecond member of the first series corresponds with the second\nmember of the second series.\n\nIn other words, it is alternate when, of the four members, the first\ncorresponds with the third, and the second with the fourth.\nJos. 9:22-25.-\nА 22.

In the first and third it\nis the “heart,” while in the second and fourth it is the “spirit.”\n\nThese words cannot be applied to the Christian now, inasmuch as\nthe old nature is not taken away, but a new nature is imparted. This is\nthe teaching of Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom.\n4:1-25; Rom. 5:1-21; Rom. 6:1-23; Rom. 7:1-25; Rom. 8:1-39, where\nin 1:16-5:11, sins are first dealt with, as the fruit of the old nature, and\nthen, from 5:12-8:39, sin is dealt with, as the tree which produces the\nfruit: and we are taught that, though the evil fruits are still produced,\nGod reckons the tree itself as dead. So, though sin itself no longer\nreigns, yet sins are still committed by the old nature; but the saved\nsinner is to reckon that old nature, {6., himself, as having died with\nChrist, and he has now a new nature.\n\nThe old nature is not taken away, as it will be in the case of Israel\nin that day: so the believer has in himself one nature that cannot but\nsin, and another that cannot sin (19η. 3:9; 1Jn. 5:18).\n\nThe old nature can never be improved, and the new nature needs\nno improvement.\nUntil the believer recognises this truth he can never know peace\n\nwith God.\nHeb. 1:1-14; Heb. 2:1-18 -\n\nΑ 1:1, 2-. God speaking.\n\nВ -2-14. The Son of God: “better than the angels.”\n\nА 2:1-4. God speaking.\n\nВ 5-18. The Son of Man: “lower than the angels.”\n\nHere the two subjects are arranged alternately. And note that B is\nin a parenthesis with respect to A and A; while A is in a parenthesis\nwith respect to B and B. In other words, A and A read on continuously,\nwithout reference to B, while B and B likewise read on without\nreference to A, which is thus practically in a parenthesis.\n\nHence the word “therefore,” 2:1, is not consequent on 1:14, but on\n1:2-. And the “for” in 2:5 is consequent, not on 2:4, but on 1:14. The\nrespective members therefore read on\n\nThus: (1:1) “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners\nspake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last\ndays spoken unto us by his Son ... (ii. i.) therefore we ought to give\nthe more earnest heed to the the things which we have heard, etc.”\nAnd: (1:14) “Are they not all ministering (worshipping) spirits, sent\nforth to minister for (to serve) them who shall be heirs of salvation?...\n(2:5) for unto the angels hath he not put into subjection the world to\ncome, etc.”\n\n2. Extended Alternation\nThis is when there are still only two series, but each series consists of\nmore than two members.\n\nAnd these are so arranged that the first of the one series\ncorresponds with the first of the other; and likewise the second of the\nformer corresponds with the second in the latter.\n\nThis has been called by some Direct Chiasmus, reserving the term\n“Indirect Chiasmus” for what we have called  Introverted\nCorrespondence, or Chiasmus proper.\n\nBengel calls this “Direct Chiasmus”: but this is contrary to the very\nname of the figure: viz., the letter Chi (X.), which he says, is, as it\nwere, the type or mould according to which the sentence or words is\nor are arranged.\n\nWe prefer to consider it merely as Alternate Correspondence in an\nextended form, reserving the term Chiasmus for Introverted\nCorrespondence.\nPsa. 66:1-20 -\nA 1,2.

Introverted Correspondence\nThis is where there are two series, and the first of the one series of\nmembers corresponds with the /ast of the second; the second of the\nfirst corresponds with the penultimate (or the last but one) of the\nsecond: and the third of the first corresponds with the antepenultimate\nof the second. That is to say, if there are six members, the first\ncorresponds with the sixth, the second with the fifth, and the third with\nthe fourth. And so on.\n\nThe Greeks called it CHIASMOS or CHIASTON from its likeness in\nform to the letter Chi (X.). For the same reason the Latins called it\nCHIASMUS, as well as DECUSSATA ORATIO from decusso, to divide\ncross-wise (i.e., in the shape of an X). The Greeks called it also\nALLELOUCHIA (from ἀλλήλους (alleelous), together and ἔχειν\n(echein), to have or hold, a holding or hanging together.\n\nThis is by far the most stately and dignified presentation of a\nsubject; and is always used in the most solemn and important portions\nof the Scriptures.\n\nBengel observes with regard to this form of the Figure, that “its\nemployment is never without some use: viz., in perceiving the\nornament and in observing the force of the language; in understanding\nthe true and full sense; in making clear the sound Interpretation; in\ndemonstrating the true and neat analysis of the sacred text.”* [Note:\nSee The Structure of the Books of the Bible, by the same author and\npublisher.]\nGen. 43:3-5.-\nА Judah’s words: “The man did solemnly protest unto us, etc.”\nВ Jacob\'s act: “If thou wilt send.”\nВ Jacob\'s act: “But if thou wilt not send him.”\nА Joseph’s words: “For the man said unto us, etc.”\nIn A and A, we have Joseph’s words; and in B and B, Jacob’s\naction.\nLev. 14:51-52.-\nА “And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the\nscarlet,\nBand the living bird,\nС — апа dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the\nrunning water,\nО and sprinkle the house seven times:\nD And he shall cleanse the house\nС with the blood of the bird, and with the running\nwater,\nВ — апа with the living bird,\nА and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the\nscarlet.”\nNote also the figure of Polysyndeton (q.v.

Complex Correspondence\nThis is where the members of a structure are arranged both in\nalternation (simple or extended) and in introversion, combined\ntogether in various ways, giving the greatest possible variety and\nbeauty to the presentation.\n\nNot only is this complex arrangement Of a passage complete in\nitself; but very often there is a double arrangement, the one within the\nother, and consistent with it, though differing from it.\n\nAnd further, the longer members of any particular structure\ngenerally contain and have their own special arrangement, and may\nbe severally expanded.\n\nIn some of the following examples, we have given first the general\nstructure of a whole book or passage and then the expansion of some\nof the larger members of which it is composed.\n\nThe Ten Commandments as a whole, as well as separately, are\nbeautiful examples of complex structure. Take the fourth as a\nspecimen (Exo. 20:8-11):-\n\nΑ 8. The Sabbath-day to be kept in remembrance by man.\n\nВ а 9. The six days for man’s work.\nb 10. The Seventh day for man’s rest.\nВ а 11-.

(“For.”)\n\nThis Psalm is a simple introversion of four members, but the first\nmember, “a,” while it thus forms part of a larger member is itself\nconstructed as an extended introversion, which helps to the\nunderstanding of verses 1-4.\n\nа ο 1. “Thy tabernacles.”\n\n@ 2. Desire for the courts of the Lord.\nе — 3-. As the sparrow.\nе — -3-. As the swallow.\n@ -3. Desire for the altars of the Lord.\nc 4. “Thy house.”\nThe two members d and d read on connectedly thus: “My soul\nlongeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my\nflesh crieth out for the living God ... even thine altars, O Lord of hosts,\nmy King and my God.”\n\nThus we are prevented from supposing that birds could build nests\n\nin the altar of burnt offerings, on which fires were always burning, and\nwhich was overlaid with brass; or in the altar of incense, which was\nwithin the Holy Place, and overlaid with gold! (see page 96).\nPsa. 49:1-20. is perhaps one of the most striking examples of\nComplex Correspondence which the Scriptures afford. The Psalm, as\na whole, is alternate, with a Thema, or general subject. The first and\nthird members are arranged as an introversion; while in each of the\nfour members of which it is composed, a couplet is answered by a\nquatrain, and a quatrain by a couplet.\n\nThe Thema, or Subject, anticipates the double form of the Psalm\nitself. It is in two quatrains: (1) All people to hear (2) | will speak. The\nfirst two lines of each quatrain are broken up and arranged alternately,\nwhile the second two lines of each quatrain are introverted:\n\n(1) All People to hear.\n$  1-. “Hear this\n# — -1-. All ye people,\n$ -1-. Give ear,\n@{ -1. All ye inhabitants of the world.\nи — 2-.

Why fear? (couplet).\nb 6-9. No redemption for the worldly (quatrain,\nalternate).\nο — 10-. Death (couplet).\n4 -10, 11. Worldly wisdom (quatrain, introverted).\nВ — 12.

Man compared to beasts (couplet).\n\nHere note that, as in other cases, the corresponding members\n(which are marked by the same letters) may be read on, the one being\nexplanatory of the other: the question in “a” (“Why fear?”) being\nanswered in a (“Fear not, etc.”)\n\nPsa. 105:1-45. affords another beautiful example, but we can give\nonly the key to it.\n\nΑ 1-7. Exhortation to praise the Lord (second person, plural).\n\nВ 8-12. Basis of praise, God’s covenant with Abraham, in\npromise.\nС а 13. The journeyings of the Patriarchs.\nЬ — 14, 15.

Their affliction.\nd 26-41. Mission of Moses to deliver.\nВ 42-45-. Basis of praise. God’s covenant with Abraham, in\nperformance.\nА -45. Exhortation to praise the Lord (second person, plural).\nHere, the Psalm as a whole is an introversion, while the two\ncentral members are placed in strong correspondence by an extended\nalternate arrangement; in which we have in the first (C) the history of\nthe Patriarchs (Genesis), and in the second (C) the history of the\nNation (Exodus).\nNote also that while A and A are in the second person plural, all\nthe rest of the Psalm is in the third person.\nNote further that the two longer members B and B are similarly\nconstructed, and the subjects repeated by extended alternation (as in\nС and C), thus:-\nВ е 8-10. The Covenant remembered.\nf 11. The Land promised.\n9 — 12. The People described.\nВ е 42, 43. The Covenant remembered.\nf 44. The Land inherited.\n9 45. The People described.\nIn like manner the two longer members d and d may be shown to\nhave the same wonderful structure.\nЯ ἩἹ 17. The sending of the deliverer.\ni 18, 19. His trial by the word.\nκ 20-22. The deliverance.\nа ΠΠ 26. The sending of the deliverers.\ni 27-36. Egypt\'s trial by the word (see verse 27, margin).\nк 37-41. The deliverance.\nPsa. 146:1-10 :.-This Psalm affords another beautiful example of the\ncombined correspondence. As a whole the Psalm is an Introversion;\nwhile the inner members consist of an extended alternation:-\nA 1, 2. Praise. Hallelujah.\nВ а — 3-. Wrong trust, in man.\nЬ -3. Man powerless.\nο — 4. Man perishable.\nВ а 5. Right trust, in God.\nЬ 6-9. God all-powerful,\nс — 10-. God eternal.\nА -10. Praise. Hallelujah.\nPsa. 148:1-14.-\nА 1-. Hallelujah.\nВ а -1.

Praise from the earth (second person).\nЬ — -7-12. Enumeration of earthly things.\nс — 13-. Injunction to praise (third person).\nа -13, 14-. Inducements: (“for”).\nА -14. Hallelujah.\nHere, again, while the whole Psalm is introverted, the two centre\nmembers are arranged as an extended alternation.\nMar. 3:21-35.-\nA а 21-. His kindred. “His friends” (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]\nkinsmen).\nЬ — -21-. Their interference. “Went out.”\nο  -21. Their disparagement of Him. “For they said,\netc.”\nва 22-. The Scribes: Their first charge, “He\nhath.”\nе -22, Their second charge, “He casteth\nout.”\nB e 23-27. His answer to the second\ncharge.\nd 28-30. His denunciation of the first charge.\nA а 31-. His kindred. “There came then his, etc.”\nЬ — -31, 32. Their interference. “Sent, calling.”\nο 33-35. His disparagement of them.\nFrom this beautiful complex structure, we learn that, as “d”\ncorresponds with “d,” the sin against the Holy Ghost is the saying that\nChrist was possessed by a devil! And also, from the correspondence\nof “b,” with “b” we learn that the interference of the mother and\nbrethren of Christ was because they said He was “beside Himself.” No\nwonder then that their disparagement of Him (in “с”) is answered by\nHis disparagement of them (in “с”).\n\nWe give examples of the Seven Epistles addressed by the Holy\nSpirit through St. Paul to the Churches: but for the fuller development\nof them we must refer the reader to our larger work on this great and\nimportant subject.* [Note: What is the Spirit saying to the Churches?\nSee a series of articles commenced in Things to Come, Sept., 1898.]\n\nTHE PAULINE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES.\n\nEpistle to the Romans.-\n\nIntroversion.\nА 1:1-6.

Salutation.\nThe whole of this epistle is marvellously constructed, and the\nconstruction is absolutely essential to its correct interpretation.\n\nIt is hardly the design of this work to go too deeply into these\nstructures; but the doctrinal portion (a |1:16-8:39) is too important to\nbe passed over.\n\nIt is divided into two parts. The first deals with the old nature, and\nwith the fruits of the old tree. The second deals with the tree itself, and\nthe conflict between the two natures in the believer.\n\nC.

The two parts, then, stand, as follows:-\n\nа Ὁ 1:16-5:11. SINS. The products of old nature. The fruits of\n\nthe old tree.\nE 5:12-8:39. SIN. The old nature.

While B and B are a simple alternation, and C and C an\nextended alternation, with which another inner introversion is\ncombined.',''),(51,51,'prosapodosis','Joh. 16:8-11.-“And when he is come, he will reprove (marg. [Note:\narg. Margin.] , convince) the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of\njudgment:-\n“Of sin, because they believe not on me;\n“Of righteousness, because | go to my Father, and ye see me\nno more;\n“Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.”\n\nHere, after the mention of the three words together, “sin,”\n“righteousness,” and “judgment,” the Lord returns to them again, and\nrepeats them separately, for the purpose of explaining and more\nparticularly defining them. Thus we learn that the mission and work of\nthe Holy Ghost with regard to the world was to bring it in guilty (for that\nis the meaning of the word) concerning these three important facts.\n\n(1) “Sin” is not, as man regards it, some mere yielding to the lusts\nof the flesh, but a refusal to believe God’s Gospel concerning His Son,\nthe Lord Jesus Christ. That is sin in God’s sight.\n\n(2) “Righteousness.” Seeing they rejected Christ, and would not\nbelieve on Him, He was, in righteousness, removed from the earth,\nand is returned to the Father, until He comes again in\n\n(3) “Judgment.” For the prince of this world has been judged,\nsentence has been passed upon him, and ere long it will be put into\nexecution.\n\nRom. 11:22.-“Behold therefore, the goodness and severity of God: on\nthem which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue\nin his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.”\n\nHere, the return to the two words is not direct, as in Joh. 16:8-11,\nbut in an Epanodos (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ).\n\nа000 Goodness.\nb25 Severity.\nb= Severity.\n\na®20 Goodness.\n\nThe statement refers to the Gentiles as such (see verse 13, “I\nspeak to you, Gentiles”), and cannot refer to the Church of God; for, of\nthe members of Christ\'s Body it has been already stated and declared\nin chapter 8, that there is no condemnation, and no separation.\n\nTo interpret Rom. 11:1-36 of the Church, and not of the Gentiles as\nGentiles is not only to miss the whole teaching conveyed by the\nstructure (see page 385) as to the separate Doctrinal and\nDispensational sections of the Epistle, but it is to make the grace of\nGod of no effect, and to destroy the standing of the Christian, and his\neternal preservation in Christ.\n\nPhp. 1:15-17.-“Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife;\nand some also of good will:\n\nThe one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to\nadd affliction to my bonds:\n\nBut the other of love, knowing that | am set for the defence of the\nGospel.”\n\nHere, after having first stated the two classes, he returns to them\nto explain his meaning further.',''),(52,52,'epidiegesis','No content for this figure.',''),(53,53,'epexegesis','No content for this figure.',''),(54,54,'exergasia','Psa. 17:1.-\n“Hear the right, O Lord,\nAttend unto my cry,\nGive ear unto my prayer.”\nPsa. 18:1-2.-\n“| will love thee О Lord, my strength.\nThe Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer:\nMy God (ΕΙ), my strength, in whom | will trust;\nMy buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.”\nPsa. 35:1-3.-\n\nа10 “Plead my cause, О Lord, with them that strive with me;\nΡ15 Fight against them that fight against me.\n\n82” Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.\nb22 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them\n\nthat persecute me:\n43: Say unto my soul, | am thy salvation.\n632 4-8. Let them, etc.”\n\nAnd so the Psalm goes on. In a1, a2, and a3, we have prayer for\nhimself (Defensive), and in b1, b2, and b3, prayer against his enemies\n(Offensive). In each case the meaning is further developed.\n\nPsa. 35:4.-\n\n“Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my\n\nsoul:\n\nLet them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise\n\nmy hurt.\n\nLet them be as the chaff before the wind:\nAnd let the angel of the Lord chase them, etc.”\nIn verses 4-8 we have:\ne204.

In ο and с we have the deep as a whole,\nand in d and а the waters which make it up.\nZec. 6:12-13.-\n“Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying:\nBehold, the man whose name is the BRANCH;\nAnd he shall grow up out of His place,\nAnd He shall build the temple of the Lord:\nEven He shall build the temple of the Lord:\nAnd He shall bear the glory,\nAnd shall sit and rule upon His throne;\nAnd He shall be a priest upon His throne:\nAnd the counsel of peace shall be between them.”\n\nHere, the figure is enhanced by Polysyndeton (q.v.

It is clear from\nverse 24 that the sin against the Holy Ghost was the attributing of the\nLord’s work to Beelzebub, or the Evil Spirit. See verse 28, and page\n384.\n\nMat. 15:18-20.-Here, after the statement that “those things which\nproceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile\nthe man,” the Lord goes on to impress the important fact by dwelling\nupon it, and explaining that “out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,\netc. ...” and adding “these are the things that defile a man. And not to\neat with unwashed hands. He shows that it is “not that which goeth\ninto the mouth” (verse 11): these things do not defile a man.\n\nMar. 7:20-23.-The solemn fact of verse 20 as to what really defiles is\ndwelt upon in the following verses, in order to impress its truth upon\nthe mind.\nJoh. 21:15-17.-Peter’s threefold restoration is dwelt upon in these\nverses, to assure him that his threefold denial had not cut him off; and\nthat though he failed, the prayer of his great Advocate was heard and\nanswered, so that his faith did not fail.\n\nCol. 2:14-15.-Here the blessed effect of Christ\'s death is dwelt upon in\nthe enumeration of some of its triumphant results.',''),(56,56,'hermeneia','Psa. 7:1-17, where verse 13 (14) explains verse 12 (13).\nPsa. 77:19.-After saying\n“Thy way is in the sea,\nAnd thy path in the great waters,”\nthe interpretation is added:\n“And thy footsteps are not known.”\nIsa. 1:23.-After the words\n“Thy silver is become dross,\nThy wine mixed with water,”\nthe interpretation is added:\n“Thy princes are rebellious, etc.”\nIsa. 34:6.-Here the statement about the sword of the Lord in the\nformer part of the verse is explained in the latter part.\nIsa. 44:3.-\n“| will pour water upon him that is thirsty,\nAnd floods upon the dry ground.”\n\nThis is immediately explained to mean:\n“| will pour my spirit upon thy seed,\nAnd my blessing upon thine offspring.”\nIsa. 51:1-23, where verse 2 explains verse 1.\nHos. 7:8-9.-Here verse 9 is the interpretation of verse 8.\nAmo. 3:8.-Here we have first\n“The lion hath roared,\nWho will not fear?”\nand then the interpretation:\n“Adonai Jehovah hath spoken,\nWho can but prophesy?”\nMat. 6:24 and Luk. 16:13.-Here the last clause interprets the first.\nThis is on account of, and is shown by the structure:\nΑΓΌ “No servant can serve two masters,\nBoo a0 For either he will hate the one,\n6299 and love the other;\n(B00000000 555 or else he will hold to the one,\nа200 and despise the other.\nA™ Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\nHere A interprets A, showing that the two masters meant are God\nand Mammon; while, in B and B, the two-fold reason is given in the\nform of an Epanodos (q.v.

Words\n1. Certain idiomatic words\nAccording to the Hebrew idiom (see under /diom), two nouns are often\nused together, one of which appears to be redundant. Glassius* [Note:\nPhilol. Sac., Lib. i., Tract 1, Can. 38.] gives a list of certain words,\nwhich are thus commonly used to enhance and emphasize the force\nof the other noun. Not as an adjective; for in that case the figure would\nbe Enallage instead of Pleonasm. Some of these come under the\nfigures Synecdoche and Idiom (q.v. [Note: Which see.] )\nThe ten words are as follows:-\n1. ΦρὕΗ (Pahneem), faces.\nThe word is always in the plural on account of the various features\nof the face.\n\nGen. 1:2.-“And darkness was upon the faces of the deep,” {6., upon\n\nthe deep. But how much more forcible and emphatic the expression\n\nbecomes by the pleonasm.\n\nGen. 11:8.-“So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the\n\nface of all the earth:” {6., all over the earth.\n\nGen. 16:8.-‘l flee from the face of my mistress Sarai,” instead of “from\n\nmy mistress.”\n\nGen. 23:3.-“And Abraham stood up from before his dead.” Lit., from\n\nthe face of his dead, i.e., from the presence of his dead wife.\nSometimes the word is omitted in translation:\n\nExo. 7:10.-“And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh,” Lit., before\n\nthe face of Pharaoh, i.e., before his very eyes.\n\nLev. 23:40.-“And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God.” Lit.,\n\nbefore the face of the Lord your God, i.e., in His very presence.\n\nJdg. 11:3.-“Then Jephthah fled from his brethren.” Here the A.V.\n\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n\n1611.] has again omitted the word “face,” but in this case has put it in\n\nthe margin.\n1Sa. 14:25.-“And there was honey upon the ground.” Lit., upon the\nface of the ground, {6., spread out.\nIsa. 14:21.-“That they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the\nface of the earth with cities.”\nIsa. 19:8.-“And they that spread nets upon the waters.” Lit., upon the\nface of the waters.\nHos. 10:7.-“As the foam upon the water.” See margin, “the face of the\nwater.”\nAmo. 5:8.-“And poureth them out upon the face of the earth.”\n\nIn the N.T., though we have Greek words, we have the same\nHebrew idiom.\nLuk. 21:35.-“As a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the\nface of the whole earth.” Here the Pleonasm emphasizes the universal\ncharacter of the events connected with “the great Tribulation.”\nAct. 3:19.-“That so there may come (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] ) times of refreshing from the presence (face) of the Lord.”\nAct. 5:41.-“And they departed from the presence of the council.” Lit.,\nthe face о!\nAct. 17:26.-“For to dwell on all the face of the earth.”\nRev. 12:14.-“From the face of the serpent,” {6., a great way off from\nthe serpent.\n2. ФД (Peh), mouth.\n\nThis word seems to be redundant when used with the word\n“sword”: “the mouth of the sword.” But this use of the Figure is to\nemphasize the fact that it is not a mere sword, but a sword with its\nsharp devouring edge, which is thus compared to a mouth.\n\nGen. 34:26.-“And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the\nedge (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , Heb., mouth) of the sword.”\n\nSo also Exo. 17:13. Deu. 13:15. Eze. 6:11. Amo. 7:11. Luk. 21:24.\nHeb. 11:34.\n\nA sword with two mouths is a sword which devoured\nexceedinglyand slew large numbers; Jdg. 3:16. Rev. 1:16; Rev. 3:13.\nHeb. 4:12.\n\nOther uses of the word are seen in\nGen. 43:7.-“We told him according to the tenor (Heb., the mouth) of all\nthese words”: i.e., all those things concerning which they had been\ninterrogated.\n\nNum. 26:56.-“According to the (mouth of the) lot”: {6., according to\nwhat the lot shall say or determine.\n\nPro. 22:6.-“Train up a child in the way he should go.”\n\nHeb., in the mouth of his way: i.e., at the very mouth or entrance\non life, so that it may be determined in a direction of justice and\nhonesty, etc.\n\n3. 6ρύη (Bahneem), sons or children\nGen. 11:5.-“The Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which\nthe children of men builded”: /.е., men viewed as the descendants of\nAdam; the human race.\n1Ki. 8:39.-“Thou ... knowest the hearts of all the children of men”: i.e.,\nof all men, with emphasis on the “all.”\nEcc. 3:18.-“I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of\nmen.”\n\nΠ.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “I said in mine heart, /Е is\nbecause of the sons of men, that God may prove them, etc.”\nHere, the figure shows that the emphasis is on “men” in contrast to\n“beasts.” “Yet | said in my heart respecting MEN, God hath chosen\nthem to show that they, even they, are like beasts.”\n\nPsa. 36:7.-“How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the\nchildren of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings,” i.e.,\nmen in all ages-not merely men, as such, but men in all their\nsuccessive generations.\n\nSo also in the New Testament we find the same usage:\n\nMar. 3:28.-“All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men,” i.e., men\nin all ages, as in Mat. 12:31.\n\nEph. 3:5.-“Which (i.e., the Mystery) in other ages was not made\nknown unto the sons of men:” i.e., to any human being.\n\nIt is according to this Figure or Hebraism that Christ is called “the\nSon of Man,” as the man, the representative man, the man who had\nbeen long promised as the seed of the woman; the man prophesied.\nTherefore this title used of Christ usually has reference to that aspect\nof His work as the appointed Judge of men (Act. 17:31). “The Son of\nMan’ is therefore an emphatic dispensational title of Christ. It means\nmerely “man,” but with emphasis on all that the word means as used\nof Christ and his dominion in the earth. See Mat. 10:23; Mat. 16:13;\nMat. 16:27-28. Mar. 2:28. Luk. 6:5. Joh. 3:14. etc., etc.\n\nEzekiel is often thus addressed by God (chap. 2, 1, 11, etc.), as\n“son of man,” but in his case without the article.\n\nSee also Psa. 8:4 (the first occurrence); 144:3, etc.\n\nIn Psa. 127:4 (5) we have “children of the youth,” {6., young\nchildren.\n\nJoe. 3:6.-“The sons of Greece,” {6., Greeks.\nDeu. 9:2.-“Sons of the Anakim”: i.e., Anakim.\n\nThe word in the plural means simply the name of the nation\nviewed as descended from some progenitor: e.g., “children of Israel”:\nie., Israelites, “children of Ammon, Moab, etc.”\n\n4. ЩН (Shem), name\n\n(a) This word appears to be redundant in the phrase “the name of\nGod.” It means God Himself, and has greater emphasis than if the\nsimple word God were used.\n\nIsa. 30:27.-“Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far”: i.e.,\nJehovah Himself.\n\nJer. 44:26.-“Behold, | have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord”:\ni.e., by myself, by my own majesty, by all that my name implies.\n\nMic. 5:4.-“And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in\nthe majesty of the name of the Lord his God”; i.e., in the majesty of\nJehovah Himself.\nPsa. 20:1 (2).-“The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the name of\nthe God of Jacob defend thee:” i.e., Jacob’s God Himself.\n\nSo also verse 7 (8), etc.\nPsa. 113:1.-“Praise the name of the Lord”: i.e., “Praise Jehovah\nHimself.”\n(0) When used with the verb ЧША (karah), to call, it means\nemphatically to name.\n\nSee Gen. 11:9; Gen. 19:22; Gen. 27:36; Gen. 41:51.\n\n(c) The worship and profession of God is indicated by the phrases\n“call upon the name of the Lord:” i.e., to worship Jehovah himself\n(Gen. 4:26. Jer. 10:25).\n\n“To love the name of the Lord;”\n\n“To walk in the name of the Lord;”\n\n“To praise the name of the Lord.”\n\nAll these expressions mean, by the figure of Pleonasm, to worship\nand fear Jehovah Himself as opposed to self, and all other gods.\n\nWe have the same figure in the New Testament:-\n\nMat. 6:9 and Luk. 11:2.-“Hallowed be thy name”: i.e., “Let thy holy\nmajesty-thyself alone-be worshipped.”\n\nRev. 15:4.-“Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?”:\nie., fear and worship Thee Thyself.\n\nMat. 1:21.-“Thou shalt call his name JESUS”: i.e., shall call Him that\nholy one Himself.\n\nSo Luk. 1:13; Luk. 2:21.\n\nRom. 10:13.-“Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be\nsaved”: {6., not whosoever shall utter the name, but whosoever shall\nbe a true worshipper of God in Christ shall be saved.\nSo Heb. 13:15. Joh. 1:12; Joh. 2:23; Joh. 3:18, etc.\n5. ЙГ (yaad), hand.\n\nThe word “hand” is used in various ways (both idiomatically and by\nMetonymy, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) to express the instrument by\nwhich a thing is done; and this in order to put the emphasis on the fact\nthat the power did not lie in the instrument, but in him who used it.\nGen. 9:5.-It seems superfluous, but it is not. It emphasizes the fact\nthat it is God who requires punishment for shedding man’s blood, and\nthat he will use all and every instrument to accomplish His will.\n\nExo. 4:13.-“And he (Moses) said, O Lord (Adonai), send | pray thee\nby the hand thou wilt send”: {6., by any agency except me!\n\n1Sa. 17:37.-“The Lord that delivered me out of the paw (hand) of the\nlion, and out of the paw (hand) of the bear, he will deliver me out of the\nhand of this Philistine”: {6., the power of the lion, and the bear, and\nGoliath. See Psa. 22:20 (21) (= the dog); 49:15 (16); 107:2. 1Ki. 11:12.\n1Ki. 8:53.-“Thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant”: {6., by\nMoses. Jehovah was the speaker, Moses was only the instrument.\n\nSo also 2Ki. 17:13, and many other passages in which Jehovah\nspeaks by the hand of his prophets.\n1Ch. 6:31 (16).-“And these are they whom David set over the service\nof song in the house of the Lord.” Lit., “over the hands of song,” .e.,\nover the instruments of song, so as to minister music. So 2Ch. 29:27,\n“the hands of the instruments (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).\n\nIsa. 64:6 (5).-“And our iniquities.” Lit., “the hand of our iniquities”: {6.,\nthe power of our iniquities.\n\nTo this belongs Psa. 7:3 (4), “If there be any iniquity in my hands.”\nLit., in the hands of me: i.e., in me. A kind of Metonymy (q.v. [Note:\nWhich see.] ), or Synecdoche, by which a part of a person is put for\nthe whole.\n\nIn the New Testament we have the same use of the word χείρ\n(cheir), Παπά.\n\nMar. 6:2.-“That even such mighty works are wrought by his hands.”\nLit., “by the hands of him”: i.e., by Him.\n\nLuk. 1:71.-“From the hand of all that hate us”: i.e., not merely from our\nenemies, but from the power of those enemies who hate us and cause\nus to serve them.\n\nSo also Act. 5:12; Act. 7:25; Act. 7:35.\n\nIn Act. 15:23, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] omits “by the hands of them,” and\nsubstitutes the word “letters” in italics. The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] says, “They wrote thus by them” (Gal. 3:19 and Rev.\n19:2).\n6. Ъек (tavech) and ULLIO (kerev), midst\nThe phrase “in the midst” is used phonastically when it is not to be\ntaken literally as being equidistant from the extremes, or when it only\nadds emphasis to the sense.\n\nGen. 45:6.-“These two years hath the famine been in the land.” Lit.,\n“in the midst of the land”: .e., all over it. Here it is not translated at all.\nNum. 14:13.-“Thou broughtest up this people in (or by) thy might from\namong them.” Lit., “out of the midst of them”: out of Egypt. See also\nJos. 3:17. 2Ki. 4:13. Psa. 22:14 (15).-“My heart is like wax; it is\nmelted in the midst of my bowels”: i.e., within me. So Psa. 40:8; Psa.\n40:10 (9, 11).\n\nPsa. 22:22 (23).-“In the midst of the congregation will | praise thee”:\nie., in the assembly of the People; not of the “church,” which was\nafterwards revealed to Paul in the New Testament Scriptures as the\n“Mystery.”* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and\npublisher.] But wherever God’s People are assembled, there is He “in\nthe midst of ({:6., with) them.”\n\nPsa. 40:8; Psa. 40:10 (9, 11).-“In the midst of my heart”: i.e., in me.\nPsa. 48:9 (10).-“In the midst of thy temple”: i.e., in thy temple.\n\nIsa. 10:23.-“In the midst of all the land.”\nHab. 3:2.-“Revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of\nthe years make known’: i.e., within or during that time of Tribulation.\n(See also under Anadiplosis).\nZec. 2:5; Zec. 2:10-11 (9, 14, 15).-“In the midst of thee”: i.e., in thee.\nMat. 13:49.-“And sever the wicked from among the just”: i.e., from. So\nAct. 17:33. 2Co. 6:17.\n\nFor other illustrations see Mat. 13:25. Luk. 17:11. Heb. 2:12.\n(Compare Psa. 22:22 (23), above).\n\n7. MO (lev), MOO (levav), heart\n\nThe word “heart” is sometimes used pleonastically by Metonymy\n(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ) for the midst, when it does not mean literally\nthe precise middle point.\nExo. 15:8.-“In the heart of the sea.” So Psa. 46:2. Pro. 23:34; Pro.\n30:19. Eze. 27:4.\nMat. 12:40.-“In the heart of the earth”: {6., in the earth.\n\n8. Γ6μι (Davar), word.\n\nis very frequently used in the same way.\n\nPsa. 35:20.-“Deceitful matters.” Lit., “words of frauds”: i.e., frauds.\nPsa. 65:3 (4).-“Iniquities prevail against me.” Here the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] puts\nthe literal meaning in the margin, “the words or matters of iniquity”:\ni.e., my iniquitous matters. So with\nPsa. 105:27.-“The words of his signs.”\nPsa. 145:5.-“The words of thy wonders”: i.e., as rendered “thy\nwondrous works.”\n9. UCM (K?N, voice-\n\nGen. 3:8.-“They heard the voice of the Lord God walking, etc.”: i.e.,\nthe sound, or merely Jehovah Elohim.\nPsa. 98:5.-“The voice of a psalm”: i.e., with a psalm.\nPsa. 102:5 (6).-“The voice of my groaning”: i.e., my groaning.\nIsa. 24:18.-“The noise (voice) of the fear. (See also under\nParonomasia).\nJer. 16:9.-“I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in\nyour days,\n\nthe voice of mirth, and\n\nthe voice of gladness,\nthe voice of the bridgeroom, and\nthe voice of the bride.”\nThis does not mean that there shall be any bridegrooms and\nbrides without voices, but that marriage itself shall cease.\nJer. 51:54.-“А sound of a cry.” Lit., the voice of a cry: {6., a great\nclamour. So Zep. 1:10, etc.\n10. YONH (yahmeem), days.\nThe word days joined with years, etc., is used pleonastically. See\nGen. 47:8, (9). Exo. 13:10. Jdg. 19:2 (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).\n2Sa. 19:34 (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ). Psa. 90:10.\nGen. 29:14.-“And he abode with him the space of a month.” Marg.\n[Note: arg. Margin.] : “Heb., a month of days.” This, by the figure of\nHypallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), stands for the days of a month:\nie., a full month. So Num. 11:20-21.\n\n11. engn (vayehee), and it came to pass.\n\nSometimes this word appears to be redundant; as well as the\nGreek καὶ ἐγένετο (kai egeneto). That is to say, as the sense is\ncomplete without it, it is added for the sake of emphasis.\n\nSee the preterite. Gen. 38:1; Gen. 38:7; Gen. 38:24; Gen. 38:28;\nGen. 39:10; Gen. 39:13; Gen. 39:15, etc. Mat. 7:28; Mat. 9:10; Mat.\n11:1; Mat. 13:53; Mat. 19:1; Mat. 26:1. Mar. 1:9; Mar. 2:15. Luk. 1:24;\nLuk. 1:41; Luk. 2:1; Luk. 2:6; Luk. 5:1.\n\nSo with the future; Deu. 18:19. Jos. 2:14. 1Ki. 18:24; 1Ki. 20:7. Isa.\n7:23. Hos. 2:23. Joe. 3:15. Act. 2:6; Act. 3:23. Rom. 9:26.\n\n2. Other Words\nDeu. 33:19.-“Treasures hid in the sand.”\n\nHere the figure is very freely rendered. Lit., it is “hidden-things\nhidden of the sand”, i.e., the hidden things of the earth, in contrast with\nthe treasures of the sea.\n\nPsa. 40:7.-“Then said |, Lo, | come: in the volume of the book it is\nwritten of me” i.e., in the book, namely, Holy Scripture. (See under\nSynecdoche). The second noun (in regimen) being as the genitive of\napposition. See Appendix Β.\n\nIsa. 33:23.-“Тпеп is the prey of a great spoil divided. Heb., TT\nΠΙΜΜ (ad shalal), a prey of a spoil: i.e., a great spoil.\n\nDan. 12:2.-“And some to shame and everlasting contempt.”\n\nRom. 1:23.-“Unto an image made like.” Lit., “unto a likeness of an\nimage.”\n\nBy this figure the meaning is enhanced, so that it is as though it\nsaid, “They changed the glory of the incorruptible God actually into an\nimage of corruptible man!\n2Co. 5:1.-“The earthly house of this tabernacle,” emphasizing this\nmortal body as being so different from the heavenly body.\n\nEph. 4:23.-“And be renewed in the spirit of your mind”: i.e., that your\nwhole new nature or inner man being a new creation, Divine in its\norigin and impeccable in its character now causes the whole course of\nlife to flow in a different direction.\n\n1Th. 2:13.-“When ye received the word of God, which ye heard of\nus.” Lit., the word of hearing. λόγος ἁκοῆς (logos akoees). ἁκοῆ\n(akoee) which means hearing, is often used by the figure of Metonymy\n(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), for what is heard. See Joh. 12:38. Rom.\n10:16. “Who hath believed our hearing”: i.e., what they have heard;\nour preaching or testimony.\n\nSo here, the figure cannot be rendered literally, but the whole\nsense is enchanced by the fact that it was the word of God, which they\nheard, and not only heard but received it into their hearts.\n\nCompare Heb. 4:2; and see under Metonymy-\n\nRev. 16:19.-“The fierceness of His wrath.”\n\nHere, the figure is seen and beautifully translated: not literally, but\naccording to the enhanced sense.\n\nThe Greek is θυμὸς ὀργιίς (thumos orgees), the anger of His\nwrath, the two words being synonymous. Both refer to the working of\nthe passions of the mind, but ὀργή (orgee) is the heat of the fire, while\nθυμός (thumos) is the bursting forth of the flame. ὀργή (orgee),\ntherefore, is the more lasting feeling of anger and wrath. θυμός\n(thumos) is the more sudden manifestation of it, so that “fierceness of\nHis wrath Beautifully expresses the figure.\n\nIl. Sentences\nAnother kind of Pleonasm is when the sense or whole sentence is\nrepeated in another form, and thus put in another way. This may be\ndone either affirmatively or negatively.\n1. Affirmatively\nWhen the same sense is repeated affirmatively, it is hardly to be\ndistinguished from Synonymia (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), which it much\nresembles. See Psa. 29:1-2; Psa. 89:31-32. Isa. 52:13, etc.\n\nGen. 1:20.-“And fowl that may fly above the earth, in the open\nfirmament of heaven.”\n\nInstead of saying simply in the air, it first says “above the earth,”\nand then it is further emphasized by “the open firmament of heaven,”\nin order to make the distinction between these and what had been\ncreated to be in the waters, and on the earth.\n\nNum. 19:2.-“This is the ordinance of the law which Jehovah hath\ncommanded”: i.e., the law or statute, but it is put thus to impress\nupon the people the importance of the special truth connected with\n“the red heifer.”\n\nDeu. 32:6.-“Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not\nmade thee? and established thee?”\n\nJoh. 1:22.-“Who art thou?... What sayest thou of thyself?”\n\nJoh. 5:24.-“He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent\nme, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation\n(judgment), but is passed from death unto life.”\n\nAct. 13:45.-“But when the Jews saw the multitudes,\nthey were filled with envy,\n\nand spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,\ncontradicting-\n\nand blaspheming.”\n\nPhp. 1:23.-“Which is far better.”\n\nHere, the return of Christ is declared to be πολλῶ (ρο(/2), much;\nμᾶλλον (malion), more; κρεῖσσον (kreisson), better, than either living\nor dying; out of (ἐκ) which two he was being pressed by that third\nthing: viz., the great desire εἰς τὸ ἀναλῦσαι (eis to analusai) unto the\nreturn (see under Antimeria, Epanalepsis, Resumptio, and Apostasis).\n\nΑναλύω means to return from thence hither (not from hence\nthither). See Luk. 12:36. Job. 2:1. Jdt. 13:1. 1Es. 3:3. Wisd. 2:1; 5:12.\nEcc. 3:15. Macc. 8:25; 9:1: 12:7; 15:28. Josephus Aut. 6:41.\n\nThere is no other way of being “with Christ,” as the Thessalonian\nsaints are told 1Th. 4:17, οὕτως (hout?s), thus in this matter, shall we\never be with the Lord: {6., by being “caught up to meet the Lord in the\nair’: the sleeping saints not preceding those who are alive, and the\nliving ones not preceding those who have fallen asleep (verse 15), but\nboth sleeping and living saints raised and changed, together (ἅμα\nhama) caught away.\n\nSee under Epanalepsis (pp. 206, 207), where it is shown that for\nhim to abide in the flesh is better for them-better than dying-but not\nbetter than the coming of Christ.\n2. Negatively\nHere the sense is first put positively and then negatively, or vice versa.\nThis of course greatly emphasizes the original statement, and calls\nvery special attention to it.\nGen. 40:23.-“Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat\nhim.”\n\nHere the simple statement that the chief butler did not remember\nJoseph, would have expressed the fact simply and clearly; but in order\nto emphasize and forcibly mark it, it is repeated negatively:-“but forgat\nhim,” as though to remind us that he acted after the manner of man. In\nthis character of man lies the justification of that definition of\n“gratitude” which the world has given in condemnation of itself:-that it\nis “a lively sense of favours to come”!\n\nGen. 42:2.-“That we may live and not die.” So Gen. 43:8, etc.\n\nExo. 9:19.-“Every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and\nshall not be brought home.”\n\nExo. 12:20.-“Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations ye\nshall eat unleavened bread.”\nDeu. 28:13.-“And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail:\nand thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath.”\nDeu. 32:6.-“O foolish people, and unwise.”\nDeu. 33:6.- αἱ Reuben live and not die.”\n\nThus this figure simply but emphatically reverses the\npronouncement of Jacob in Gen. 49:3-4.\n1Sa. 1:11.-“And remember me, and not forget thine handmaid.”\n1Ki. 6:18.-The stones within the Temple-walls were overlaid with\ncedar (verses 15, 16), and this cedar was further overlaid with gold\n(verse 21). It is not, therefore, necessary to the description to add\nverse 18: “There was no stone seen”: but it was necessary to\nemphasize the fact, because of the important truth which these stones\nwere afterwards to be used to typify: viz., that the “living stones” (1Pe.\n2:5), who are built up a spiritual house, are as completely covered with\nthe Divine and the glorious righteousness of Christ, in which they\nappear in the presence of God, “perfect in Christ Jesus,” “complete in\nHim.” Nothing whatever in or of themselves being seen.\n2Ki. 20:1.-“Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live”:\nie., thou shalt surely die.\nIsa. 3:9.-“They declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not.”\nIsa. 31:3.-“Now the Egyptians are men, and not God (ΕΙ); and their\nhorses are flesh and not spirit.” The figure is thus used to show the\npeople how easily Jehovah could destroy them.\nIsa. 38:1.-“Thou shalt die, and not live”: to emphasize the certainty of\nhis death.\nIsa. 45:22.-“| am God, and there is none else.” This to show that\nthere is none that save like Him.\n\nSo Isa. 46:9; Isa. 44:8.\nJer. 20:14.-“Cursed be the day wherein | was born: let not the day\nwherein my mother bare me be blessed.”\nEze. 18:13.-“He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he\nshall surely die.” Here, the negative is put first, and then repeated in\nthe positive form.\nEze. 28:2.-“Thou art a man, and not God.”\nEze. 33:15.-“He shall surely live: he shall not die.* [Note: See also\nunder Asyndeton.]\nHos. 5:3.-“l know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me.”\nHos. 11:9.-Ί am God, and not man.”\nAmo. 5:20.-“Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not\nlight?”\n\nSee this passage also under Erotesis and Metonymy.\nHab. 2:3.-‘It will surely come, it will not tarry.”\nLuk. 18:34.-\n“And they understood none of these things:\nAnd this saying was hid from them,\nNeither knew they the things which were spoken.”\n\nAll this to enhance the fact of the utter ignorance of the disciples.\nJoh. 1:3.-“All things were made by Him, and without Him was not\nanything made that was made.”\n\nJoh. 1:20.-“And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, | am\nnot the Christ.”\n\nJoh. 3:15.-“That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but\nhave eternal life.”\n\nAct. 18:9.-“Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace.”\n\nRom. 4:20.-“He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief;\nbut was strong in faith.”\n\nRom. 12:11.-“Not slothful in business.” Lit., in diligence, not slothful.\nSee under Ellipsis and Idiom.\n\nRom. 12:14.-“Bless, and curse not.”\n1Со. 1:10.-“That there be no divisions among you; but that ye be\nperfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same\njudgment.”\nGal. 5:1.-“Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath\nmade us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of\nbondage.”\n41Jn. 1:5.-“God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.”\n1Jn. 1:8.-“If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and\nthe truth is not in us.” So 1Jn. 2:4, etc.',''),(59,59,'periphrasis','Gen. 20:16.-Abimelech said unto Sarah concerning Abraham,\n“Behold, | have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold,\nhe is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee, and\nwith all other: thus she was reproved.”\n“A covering of the eyes” is a periphrasis for a husband. Having\nsaid “thy brother,” Abimelech avoids calling him directly thy husband,\nand thus rebukes her by using this beautiful periphrasis. See Gen.\n24:65. 1Co. 11:5, etc.\n\nGen. 46:26.-Those that “came out of his loins”: i.e., his direct\ndescendants-his children and grandchildren. Hence, the number of\nthese differs from (and is smaller than) the number spoken of in Act.\n7:14, which embraces “all his kindred”: i.e., all his other relations who\nare specifically excepted in Gen. 46:26.\n\nJdg. 5:10.-“Speak, ye that ride on white asses (i.e., princes), ye that\nsit in judgment (i.e., rulers), and walk by the way (i.e., merchants).”\n\nThese periphrases mean simply, “Speak, ye princes, ye rulers, and\nye merchants”; but their description, instead of their names,\nemphasizes the classes of persons so described.\n2Sa. 3:29.-“That falleth on the sword”: i.e., is put to death by the public\nexecutioner.\n2Ch. 26:5.-Uzziah “sought God in the days of Zechariah who had\nunderstanding in the visions of God”: /.е.. who was a Prophet.\n2Ch. 32:21.-“They that came forth of his own bowels (i.e., his own\nsons) slew him,” who ought to have been the very last to commit such\na crime.\nPro. 30:31.-The Periphrasis, here, in the Heb. (see marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] ) is well girt in the loins, which both the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have rendered “greyhound”!\nBut the figure is used of a war-horse caparisoned, mail-clad, and\nadorned for war.\n\nEcc. 12:1-14 is full of the most beautiful examples. See under\nEuphemism and Metalepsis.\n\nPsa. 4:7.-“Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time\nthat their corn and their wine increased”: i.e., more than in the joy of\ntheir abundant harvest and vintage.\n\nPsa. 105:18 is a Periphrasis for Joseph\'s captivity, referring to Gen.\n39:20-23; Gen. 41:12.\n\nPsa. 132:3-4.-The Periphrasis is used in order to emphasize David’s\ndetermination not to rest until he had done it.\nIsa. 14:15.-“Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell (Sheol), to the\nsides of the pit”: {6., be dead and buried.\n\nJer. 21:13.-“Inhabitress of the valley and rock of the plain”: i.e., Zion is\nspoken of by this description on account of its situation. Compare Jos.\n15:8.\n\nEze. 1:22.-“The likeness of the firmament upon (or over) the heads of\nthe living creature was as a species of ice exceedingly strong (i.e.,\ncrystal), etc.”\n\nEze. 24:16.-“The desire of thine eyes”: {6., thy wife, as is clear from\nverse 18. So verses 21 and 25.\n\nEze. 24:25.-“The lifting up of their soul”: marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ,\ntheir beloved sons and daughters.\n\nEze. 26:9.-“Engines of war”: battering-rams.\n\nEze. 31:14.-“The trees by the waters.” Lit., “trees drinking water.” The\nPeriphrasis is used for trees that are watered by irrigation. Hence,\ntrees planted in a garden.\n\nMic. 7:5.-Here we have a double Periphrasis. “The doors of thy\nmouth,” by Metonymy for words, or what is said, and “her that lieth in\nthy bosom” for thy wife.\nZep. 1:9.-“Those that leap on the threshold”: i.e., the servants of the\nrulers and others who were sent to enter the houses of others and\ntake away the good things that were therein. The words that follow\nshow this to be the correct interpretation; for such are said to fill their\nMasters’ homes with what they have taken by violence and deceit. It\ndoes not, as many suppose, refer to idolatrous worship, for the word\nГМВ (dalag) is not so used. On the contrary: compare 2Sa. 22:30.\nPsa. 18:29 (30). Son. 2:8. Isa. 35:6.\n\nMat. 11:11.-“Born of women’; i.e., born by natural process. See Luk.\n7:28. Job. 14:1; Job. 15:14; Job. 25:4. Luk. 2:23.\n\nMat. 26:29.-‘This fruit of the vine” for wine. See Metonymy-\n\nMat. 27:62.-“The next day, that followed the day of the preparation”:\ni.e., the Sabbath. This seems to be one of the most striking instances\nin the New Testament, especially when we compare Luk. 23:56. The\nselfsame day is meant. But mark the difference. To the holy and\ndevout women that day was still the Sabbath. But in the case of those\nwho had rejected “the Lord of the Sabbath,” what happens? It has\nbeen observed that, when He is on the point of leaving the Temple for\nthe last time, our Lord, who formerly, even in that same week, before\nHe had been finally rejected in that House, than which He was greater,\nhad spoken of it as “My Father’s House,” now calls it “your house.” So,\nhere again. From these rejectors of the Sabbath’s Lord, the very name\nof their sacred day is taken away. And the Spirit uses this long, round-\nabout, depreciatory phrase: “the next day, that followed the day of the\npreparation.”\n\nLuk. 2:11.-“In the city of David”: i.e., Bethlehem.\n\nLuk. 21:35.-“All them that dwell on the face of the whole earth”: i.e.,\neveryone. See under Pleonasm-\n\nJoh. 1:9.-“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that\ncometh into the world.”\n\nThis rendering is obtained by disregarding the figure, taking the\nparticiple “coming” as though it were the present tense, and referring it\nto “every man,” instead of to “the True Light.” The common Hebrew\nPeriphrasis for man was иба бтемн‚ the comer into the world*\n[Note: In accordance with Luk. 2:23.] But this expression (the Coming\nOne) in the New Testament (and especially in John’s writings) is used\nexclusively of Christ alone, and this in an exalted sense as the\nComing One. Thus the verse reads, “The True Light is he who, coming\ninto the world, lighteneth every man’ ({6., of course, every man\nwithout distinction, not without exception! which would not be true).\nThus the verse teaches: (1) that no longer was the Light to be\nconfined to one nation or to one People, but was to enlighten all\nwithout distinction of race; and (2) that no man can be enlightened\nexcept by Christ.\n2Co. 5:1.-“Our earthly house of this tabernacle”: i.e., this body.\n1Th. 4:1-18 -In this chapter there are three examples of Periphrasis,\nall used for the Gentiles:\n\nVerse 5, “which know not God.”\nVerse 12, “them that are without.”\nVerse 13, “others which have no hope.”\n\nThe description, by which the Gentiles are thus spoken of, is so\nmuch more expressive than the mere mention of the word “Gentiles.”\nHeb. 1:14.-“Heirs of salvation” is a beautiful Periphrasis for the elect.\n2Pe. 1:13.-“As long as | am in this tabernacle”: {6., am alive.\n\nVerse 14, “Shortly | must put off this my tabernacle”: i.e., must die.\nThis is strictly speaking Euphemy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ): viz., a\npleasant periphrasis to describe an unpleasant fact, instead of naming\nit plainly.',''),(60,60,'hyperbole','Gen. 2:24.-“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,\nand shall cleave unto his wife.” This does not mean that he is to\nforsake and no longer to love or care for his parents. So Mat. 19:5.\nGen. 41:47.-“And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth\nby handfuls”: i.e., one grain produced a handful of grains, which is\nhyperbolical of a prolific increase.\n\nSo verse 49.\nGen. 42:28.-“Their heart failed them.” Here the Hyperbole “their heart\nwent out,” is thus beautifully rendered.\nExo. 8:17.-“All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land\nof Egypt”: i.e., wherever in all the land there was dust, it became lice.\nDeu. 1:28.-‘The cities are great, and walled up to heaven,” to express\ntheir great height. So Deu. 9:1, etc.\nJdg. 5:4-5, beautifully sets forth the Divine Majesty manifested in\nJehovah\'s leading the People into the Promised Land.\nJdg. 20:16.-“Every one could sling stones at an hair and not miss”: to\ndescribe the wonderful proficiency which the Benjamites had attained\nin slinging stones. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] has added breadth in italics, so as to\nlessen the boldness of the Hyperbole, “an hair breadth.”\n1Sa. 5:12.-“The cry of the city went up to heaven,” to describe the\ngreatness of the cry.\n\n1Sa. 7:6.-“And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and\npoured it out before the Lord, and fasted, etc.” This is an hyperbolical\ndescription of the intensity of their weeping and lamentation. Similar\ndescriptions occur Psa. 6:6; Psa. 119:136. Jer. 9:1. Lam. 3:48-49.\n1Sa. 25:37.-Nabal’s “heart died within him, and he became as a\nstone”: i.e., he was terribly frightened and collapsed or fainted away.\n1Ki. 1:40.-“So that the earth rent with the sound of them.” A\nhyperbolical description of their jumping and leaping for joy.\n1Ki. 10:5.-“There was no more spirit in her”: i.e., she was dazed or\nstupefied, as we say, with astonishment.\n2Ch. 28:9.-“A rage that reacheth up unto heaven,” to express the\nintensity of the rage.\nEzr. 9:6.-“Our trespass is grown up unto the heavens,” to express the\nenormity of their sin.\nNeh. 8:4.-“And Ezra the Scribe stood upon a tower (marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] ) of wood”: i.e., a high wooden structure; or, as we should\nsay, a platform or pulpit.\nJob. 29:6.-“The rock poured me out rivers of oil”: i.e., | had\nabundance of all good things. So chap. 20:17 and Mic. 6:7.\nJob. 39:19.-“Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?”\n\nGlassius gives this as an Hyperbole for the neighing of the horse,\nbut it seems better to take ШТОД (ra’mah), of a flowing mane, from\nШТН (ra’am), to tremble, shake, wave, as in verse 25.\n\nThe word denotes a shaking, as well as the noise caused by the\nshaking. See Psa. 104:7. Isa. 29:6. The Ixx. has φόβον (phobon), fear,\nperhaps a mistake for φόβην (phobeen), a mane:-“Thou hast clothed\nhis neck with a flowing mane.”\n\nPsa. 107:26.-“They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to\nthe depths”: to express the violence of a storm; and waves, as we Say,\n“mountain-high.”\n\nPro. 23:8.-“The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up”: to\nexpress the suffering of regrets at having received benefits from such\na host.\n\nIsa. 5:25; Isa. 42:15.-These are hyperbolical descriptions to set forth\nthe excessive anger and judgments of Jehovah in making the Land\ndesolate.\n\nIsa. 14:13.-‘I will ascend into heaven”: to express the pride of Lucifer.\nIsa. 57:9.-“Thou ... didst debase thyself even unto hell (Sheol)”; to\nemphasize the indignity of Ahaz, king of Judah in sending to Tiglath-\nPileser, king of Assyria, to help him against Israel, saying, “I am thy\nservant!” (2Ki. 16:7, etc.).\n\nJer. 1:19; Jer. 15:20.-“They shall fight against thee” (see below, Jam.\n4:1).\n\nThe verb, which means to wage war, is Hyperbole when used of a\nsingle individual; but it told Jeremiah how bitter the opposition of man\nwould be to his Divine message.\n\nJer. 4:29.-“The whole city shall flee ... they shall go into thickets.” Lit.,\ninto the clouds; to express the inaccessible places.\n\nJer. 51:9.-“Her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even\nto the skies”: to express the magnitude of Babylon’s sin which called\nfor such a judgment (Rev. 18:5).\n\nJer. 51:53.-“Though Babylon should mount up to heaven”; to express\nthe pride of Babylon.\n\nLam. 2:1.-“How hath the Lord ... cast down from heaven unto the\nearth the beauty of Israel”: to express the degradation of Zion and the\nheight of glory from which she had fallen.\n\nLam. 2:11.-“My liver is poured upon the earth, etc”: to express the\ndepth of the Prophet\'s grief and sorrow at the desolations of Zion.\nEze. 27:28.-“The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy\npilots.”\n\nSo R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , but both margins say\nwaves. The root ВШЩЦ (garash) means to drive out, drive about.\nWhen used of a city, it refers to the suburbs which are driven out from\nthe city: but, used of the sea, it means the driving and casting about of\nits waves. See Isa. 57:20.\n\nThe figure here expresses the greatness of the terror of the\ndefenders of Tyre in the day of its overthrow: “the waves of the sea\nshall lash themselves at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.”\nDan. 9:21.-“Gabriel ... being caused to fly swiftly.” Lit. (see marg.\n[Note: arg. Margin.] ), with weariness: i.e., with such swiftness as to\ncause weariness.\n\nMat. 11:23.-“And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven,\nshall be brought down to hell.” Or, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , “And thou Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto\nheaven? thou shalt go down (or be brought down) unto Hades.”\n\nMat. 21:13.-“My house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have\nmade it a den of thieves.” The Lord thus emphasizes the fact which is\nplainly stated in Mal. 3:8 : “Ye have robbed me.”\n\nLuk. 14:26.-“If any man come to me and hate not his father and\nmother”: i.e., does not esteem them less than me. So the verb to hate\nis used (Gen. 29:31. Rom. 9:13).\n\n“Anger’ is used for displeasure (Deu. 3:26).\n\n“Save” is used for preserve (Job. 2:6. Eze. 18:17).\n\n“Lose the life” is used of esteeming it as a small matter (Mat.\n10:39; Mat. 16:25. Mar. 8:35. Luk. 9:24; Luk. 17:33, as is clear from\nRev. 12:11).\n\nTo mar is used for hurting (Rth. 4:6): i.e., for his heirs.\n\nTo rob is used of receiving wages (2Co. 11:8).* [Note: As we often\nsay, in declining a favour, “I have no wish to rob you.”]\nLuk. 18:5.-“Lest by her continual coming she weary me.” True of man-\nbut an Hyperbole as applied to God.\n\nSee Anthropopatheia\nJoh. 3:26.-“All men come to him.” Thus his disciples said to John, to\nshow their sense of the many people who followed the Lord.\n\nJoh. 12:19.-“Behold, the world is gone after him.” The enemies of the\nLord thus expressed their indignation at the vast multitudes which\nfollowed Him.\n\nJam. 3:6.-“The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.” It is a question\nhere, whethor κόσμος (Kosmos) does not mean ornament or adorning,\nas in 1Pe. 3:3 : i.e., the decking or adorning of iniquity, glozing it over\nand making that which is sinful, appear to be innocent, etc.\n\nJam. 4:1.-“From whence come wars and fightings among you.” The\nword “war” is used hyperbolically when applied to the quarrels of\nsocial life. So Jer. 1:19; Jer. 15:20 (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ). See\nabove.\n\nOther examples of Hyperbole may be seen in 2Sa. 17:13. 2Ki.\n19:24. Job. 40:18. Isa. 14:14; Isa. 34:3-4; Isa. 34:7. Eze. 26:4; Eze.\n32:5-8. Amo. 9:13. Nah. 2:3. Gal. 4:15.\n\nExamples pertaining to\n\ncomparisons\nare frequent, where one thing is compared with another, when there is\nnothing common between them:-\n\nThe sand of the sea and the dust of the earth are constantly used\nto express a vast number. (See under /diom).\n\nGen. 13:16; Gen. 22:17; Gen. 28:14. 1Ki. 4:20. 2Ch. 1:9. Heb.\n11:12 : of Abraham\'s seed.\n\nJdg. 7:12 : of the Midianites.\n\n1Sa. 13:5 : of the Philistines.\n\n1Ki. 4:29 : of Solomon’s largeness of heart.\n\nJob. 29:18 : of the days of a man’s life.\n\nPsa. 78:27 : of the feathered fowl in the wilderness.\n\nIsa. 29:5 : of other peoples.\n\nJer. 15:8 : of Judah’s widows.\n\nOther comparisons may be seen.\n2Sa. 1:23.-Saul and Jonathan “swifter than eagles,” “stronger than\nlions.”\n\nSo Jer. 4:13, and Lam. 4:19, to express great velocity.\n1Ki. 10:27.-Silver and gold as stones. So 2Ch. 1:15; 2Ch. 9:20.\nJob. 6:3.-Job’s grief heavier than the sand.\nJob. 41:18.-Leviathan’s sneezings causing light to shine.\nHab. 2:5.-To express great rapacity.\nLam. 4:7-8.-To express and contrast the dignity and indignity of the\nsons of Zion.\nhypotheses.\n\nSometimes we have Hyperbolical Hypotheses, which are\nimpossible in themselves, but are used to express the greatness of\nthe subject spoken of.\n\nPsa. 139:8; Psa. 139:10.-To show the wondrous omnipresence of\nGod.\nPro. 27:22.-To show the folly and incorrigibility of the fool.\nOba. 1:4.-To emphasize the certainty of the coming judgment of\nEdom. Compare Jer. 49:16, and Mat. 11:23 as quoted above.\n\nMar. 8:36. Luk. 9:25.-To express the utmost gain and make the\nstrongest contrast.\n\n1Co. 4:15.-To express the difference between pedagogues and\nparents.\n\n1Co. 13:1-3.-There are many hyperbolical hypotheses in these\nverses, to show the all-importance of the love of God shed abroad in\nthe heart by the Holy Ghost.\n\nGal. 1:8.-An angel from heaven preaching a different gospel is\ninconceivable. The hypothesis is used in order to show the importance\nof the Gospel of God.\n\n1Ki. 20:10.-“The boasting of Benhadad.”\n\nMat. 5:29.-“If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out ...”\n\nMat. 5:30.-“If thy right hand offend thee, etc.”\n\nIt is perfectly clear that Christ does not wish us to mutilate our\nbodies: so that this must be an hyperbolical or emphatic exhortation to\navoid and remove everything and anything that causes us to stumble.\nLuk. 10:4 is an hyperbolical command not to loiter or delay in\nceremonious salutations (such as are common even to the present\nday).\n\nJoh. 21:25 is also Hyperbole. The verb χωρῆσαι (ch?reesai) is to be\ntaken in the same sense, as it is in Mat. 19:11, where the Lord says,\n“All men cannot receive this saying;” and in verse 12, “He that is able\nto receive it, let him receive it.” The “world” is also put by Metonymy\nfor mankind.\n\nHence, Thophylact expounds χωρῆσαι (ch?reesai), to receive, by\nνοῆσαι (ποεεςεῆ, to understand.\n\nRom. 9:3.-“For | could wish that myself were accursed from Christ” is\nan hyperbolical supposition.\n\nOr we may take this sentence as being in a parenthesis, and\nrender the imperfect tense ηὐχόμην (eeuchomeen) in the sense of /\nused to wish.\n\nThe passage would then read, “I have great heaviness and\ncontinual sorrow in my heart for my brethren, my kinsmen according to\nthe flesh, (for | used to wish myself to be a cursed thing from Christ).”\n\nJud. 1:23.-“Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.” This is\nan hyperbolical prohibition as to avoiding all contact with defilement.\n\nIn the statements of the Lord Jesus there often seems to be an\nHyperbole when there is really none: e.g., Mar. 16:15. Joh. 3:32.\nAnabasis; or, Gradual Ascent\n\nAn Increase of Sense in successive Sentences\nA-n?b’-a-sis. Greek, ἀνάβασις, from ava (ana), up, and βαΐνειν\n(bainein), to go; βάσις (basis) means a stepping, or a step. So that\nAnabasis means a going up* [Note: Hence, the journey or expedition\nof Cyrus up from the coast into Central Asia is called his Anabasis, by\nXenophon.] or ascent. The Figure is so called when a writing, speech,\nor discourse, ascends up step by step, each with an increase of\nemphasis or sense.\n\nThis figure was called by the Latins INCREMENTUM (/n?-cr?-\nmen?-tum), growth or increase, from incresco, to grow on or upon.\nHence our words “increase” and “increment.”\n\nWhen this increase or ascent is from weaker to stronger\nexpression, and is confined to words, it is called Climax (q.v. [Note:\nWhich 5εε.]).\n\n[N.B.-When the sense or gradation is downward instead of\n',''),(61,61,'anabasis','Psa. 1:1.-“Blessed is the man\nthat walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,\nnor standeth in the way of sinners,\nnor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.”\nHere is a triple Anabasis depending on Parallelism (q.v. [Note:\nWhich 5εε.]).\nThe first are impious, as to their mind.\nThe second are sinners, who not only think, but carry out the\nworkings of their evil minds.\nThe third are scorners, glorying in their wickedness and\nscoffing at righteousness.\nAgain, the first continue in that mind, taking evil counsel.\nThe second carry it out, as the principle of their walk.\nThe third settle down in their evil, as on a seat.\nThese three are exemplified in the first three verses of the next\nPsalm, where a corresponding Anabasis is seen:-\nPsa. 2:1-3.-First, we have the “heathen”: i.e., the Gentile nations; then\n“the peoples”: i.e., the Tribes of God, Israel imagining vain things; and\nin the third, we have “kings” and “rulers,” all conspiring together.\nAct. 4:27 gives us the fulfilment:-(1) we have the kings and rulers\ntaking counsel; (2) we have the rage and vain imaginations; and (3)\nthe open and actual rebellion. On Psa. 1:1, see page 350.\nPsa. 7:5.-\n“Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it;\nYea, let him tread down my life upon the earth.\nAnd lay mine honour in the dust.”\nPsa. 18:37-38.-\n“| have pursued mine enemies,\nAnd overtaken them:\nNeither did | turn again till they were consumed.\n| have wounded them that they were not able to rise:\nThey are fallen under my feet.”\nIsa. 1:4.-\n“Ah sinful nation,\nA people laden with iniquity,\nAseed of evildoers,\nChildren that are corrupters.”\nEze. 2:6.-“And thou son of man,\nbe not afraid of them,\nneither be afraid of their words,\nthough briers and thorns be with thee,\nand thou dost dwell among scorpions:\nBe not afraid of the words,\n\nnor be dismayed at their looks,\nthough they be a rebellious house.”\n\nAnd why this Anabasis? To impress upon us that whatever\nopposition we may encounter, we are to speak and give forth the word\nof God, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear (verses 5\nand 7), and not to corrupt it or alter it to please the people: to distribute\nversions of it, not “the best that people will take,” but the best that we\ncan make.\n\nDan. 9:5.-\n\n“We have sinned,\n\nand have committed iniquity,\n\nand have done wickedly,\n\nand have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and\n\nfrom thy judgments.”\n\nHab. 1:5.-\n\n“Behold ye among the heathen,\n\nand regard,\n\nand wonder marvellously:\nFor | will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe,\nthough it be told you.”\nZec. 7:11-\n“But they refused to hearken,\nAnd pulled away the shoulder,\nAnd stopped their ears that they should not hear.\nYea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they\nshould hear the law, etc.”\nThus the Anabasis powerfully and emphatically sets forth the\nsecret cause of Israel’s trouble.\nZec. 8:12.\n“For the seed shall be prosperous,\nThe vine shall give her fruit,\nAnd the ground shall give her increase,\nAnd the heavens shall give their dew,\nAnd | will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these\nthings.”\n1Со. 4:8.-\n“Now ye are full,\nNow ye are rich,\nYe have reigned as kings without us.”\n\nSee under Asyndeton\n19π. 1:15\n\n“That which was from the beginning,\n\nwhich we have heard,\n\nwhich we have seen with our eyes,\n\nwhich we have looked upon,\n\nand our hands have handled, of the Word of life.”\n\nAs contrasted with Anabasis, we here introduce Catabasis, instead\nof including it under Figures involving Omission, in order that the\ncontrast may be more clearly seen.',''),(62,62,'catabasis','Isa. 40:31.-“They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;\nthey shall mount up with wings as eagles,\nthey shall run, and not be weary,\nthey shall walk, and not faint.”\nThe figure Catabasis here illustrates the effect of growth in grace.\nAt first the believer flies; but as his experience increases, he runs, and\nat the end of his course he walks. Like Paul, who first said “I suppose |\nwas not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles” (2Co. 11:5; 2Co.\n12:11). Later he writes, | “am less than the least of all saints” (Eph.\n3:8); while at the end of his life he says, | am the chief of sinners! (1Ti.\n4:15).\nJer. 9:1.-\n“Oh that my head were waters,\nand mine eyes a fountain of tears,\nthat | might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of\nmy people!” (See above.)\nLam. 4:1-2.-“How is the most fine gold changed!\n\nThe stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every\n\nstreet.\n\nThe precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,\n\nHow are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,\n\nthe work of the hands of the potter!”\nEze. 22:18.-“Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross:\nall they\n\nare brass,\n\nand tin,\n\nand iron,\n\nand lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross\n\nof silver.”\nDan. 2:1-49 -The Figure Catabasis is seen in the four successive\nworld-powers, showing a deterioration and a growing inferiority. Gold,\nsilver, brass, iron and clay. Not only is this deterioration in power and\nauthority shown in the decrease of value, but in the decrease of\nspecific gravity:-Gold is equivalent to 19-3; silver, 10-51; brass, 8-5;\niron, 7-6; and clay, 1-9. Down from 19-3 to 1-9.* [Note: See Ten\nSermons on the Second Advent, by the same author and publisher.]\nAmo. 9:2-3.-\n“Though they climb up to heaven, thence will | bring them\ndown:\nAnd though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, | will\nsearch and take them out thence:\nAnd though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea,\nthence will | command the serpent, and he shall bite them.”\nThus powerfully is shown the impossibility of escaping from the\njudgments of God.\nPhp. 2:6-8.-“Who, being in the form of God,\n1. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\n2. But made himself of no reputation.\n3. And took upon him the form of a servant,\n4. And was made in the likeness of men,\n5. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,\n6. And became obedient unto death,\n7. Even the death of the cross.”\nThese seven downward steps in the Saviour’s humiliation, are\nfollowed in verses 9-11 by seven steps upward in His glorification.\nThe word “robbery” is ἁραγμός (harpagmos), and means, not the\nthing grasped or seized, but the act of seizing. The contrast is\nbetween the first man and the second: the first Adam and the last. The\nTempter promised our first parents that they should “be as gods” (i.e.,\nas God Himself), and they grasped at equality with God.\n\nThe second man, on the contrary, did not yield to the temptation,\nbut humbled himself, and reached the highest position in glory through\nsuffering and death, even the death of the cross.\nThere is also probably a reference to Joh. 6:15. Our Lord was\nperfectly aware that He was “a born King” (Mat. 2:2). And Herod and\nall Jerusalem knew it too. Hence the consequent alarm. But the Lord\nknew also that Crsar had, for the time, been allowed of God to lord it\nover His people, for their sins, and the fulfilment of His designs. He\nwould therefore countenance no unauthorized attempt on the part of\nthose who did not believingly own Him either as to His Divine or His\nhuman nature and rights.\n\nNote also as to the words used: “Thought.” The verb ἡγεῖσθαι\n(heegeisthai), to bring one’s self to think. Adam and his wife may have\n“brought themselves to think,” at the serpent’s instigation, that the\nthing he suggested was something to grasp at, and therefore worth\nthe grasping effort. Eve, at any rate, would seem to have thought so.\nAdam we cannot, perhaps, say the same of, for “Adam,” we are\nexpressly told, “was not deceived.” Hence, apparently, his deeper\nguilt. But no “subtil serpent” could for a moment-(notice the Aor.\nἡγήσατο, He never once admitted the thought)-induce the “second\nMan,” “the Lord from heaven,” to think it possible to become equal\nwith God, any more than he could induce Him to deny or forget that\nessentially He was so in His Divine nature: Son of God, as truly as\nSon of Man. Hence we may suggest such a rendering as this: “Who,\nbeing originally in the form of God, never considered the being on an\nequality with God a usurping (or usurper’s) business.” To be what one\nis is no usurping business. Nor is it so, either, to know and assert that\none is so.',''),(63,63,'merismos','Isa. 24:1-3 where, after stating the fact, “Behold, the Lord maketh the\nearth empty,” the statement is amplified, and the way in which God will\ndo this and scatter the People is afterwards enumerated.\nEze. 36:4.-After saying “Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the\nLord God (Adonai Jehovah),” the word is spoken, not only to the\nmountains, but to the hills and rivers, and valleys, and desolate\nwastes, and the cities that are forsaken.\n\nAnd all this to show how complete shall be the blessing for the\nland of Israel.\nRom. 2:6-8.-Here, after stating that God “will render to every man\naccording to his deeds’ in verse 6, verses 7 and 8 go on to enumerate\nthe particulars of the two great classes of deeds.\nGal. 5:19-21.-“The works of the flesh” are first mentioned as a whole,\nand then the whole sixteen are named and enumerated.\nGal. 5:22-23.-“The fruit of the Spirit” is first mentioned, and then the\nnine manifestations of it are enumerated.

Bring no more vain oblations;\nincense is an abomination unto me.”\nOne sentence would have expressed the whole, “your sacrifices\nare not pleasing to me.” But, by the figure Synathroesmos, all kinds of\nsacrifices are enumerated, and the sense is thus amplified and\nemphasized to show that, with all their outward show of “religion,”\nthere was no true worship of the spirit and heart.\n\nSo with the feasts, in verse 14, and with prayers, in verse 15.\n\nThe figure is used here to emphasize the fact that religious\nordinances and services are nothing in themselves.\n\nIn the days of our Lord there was plenty of “religion”: Isa. 1:1-31\ndescribes the abundance of it; but there was no heart in it. It was all\nform! and it was these very religious people (and not the rabble) who\ncrucified the Lord!\n\nIsa. 3:16-23.-Неге, the various ornaments of women are heaped\ntogether, to heighten the effect, and to emphasize the awful judgment\nof verses 24-4:1.\n\nRom. 1:29-31.-Here, many abominations of the heathen are\nenumerated to show what is the outcome of the “reprobate mind.”\n\nThere are other figures in this passage.

For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\nwith the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the\ndead in Christ shall rise first: then, we which are alive and remain\nshall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord\nin the air: and so (i.e., thus, in this manner) shall we ever be with the\nLord.”',''),(82,82,'epicrisis','Joh. 1:24.-The sentence, “And they which were sent were of the\nPharisees,” is added to remind us of the fact that the Pharisees made\na great point of Baptism; which compelled them therefore to\nacknowledge the baptism of John to be a matter of great importance.\nJoh. 1:28.-“These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan,\nwhere John was baptizing.”\n\nThis is to explain that the people had come a long way.\n\nJoh. 3:24.-“For John was not yet cast into prison.”\n\nThis is why John had not ceased to baptize.\n\nJoh. 5:39-40.-Here we have in two verses a double Epicrisis, the first\napproving, and the second condemning, but both adding a solemn\ntruth, independent of the statement that goes before.\nA “Search the Scriptures;\nB For in them ye think ye have eternal life.\nΑΓ’ And they are they which testify of me:\nBo And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.”\nThe structure agrees also with this. It is thus exhibited in four\nmembers.\n\nIn the first and third members (A and A), we have the Scriptures;\nwhile in the second and fourth (B and B, the Epicrisis), we have the\naction and the conduct of those who possessed them.\n\nNote that the verb “search” is imperative, and not indicative, as we\nnever find the verb in the indicative commencing a sentence without\nthe pronoun or some other word; while the imperative is frequently so\nused. See Joh. 14:11; Joh. 15:20. The Jews read, but they did not\n“search.”\n\nThe verb “think” also means {ο hold as an opinion, believe (see\nAct. 15:28. 1Co. 4:9; 1Co. 7:40, etc.).\n\nJoh. 6:4.-“And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.” This is\nadded to explain how it was that so many were going out of the\ncountry up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify\nthemselves.\n\nJoh. 7:5.-“For neither did his brethren believe in him.”\n\nThis solemn addition explains a great deal: especially Mar. 3:1-35;\nfrom which it is clear, by comparing verses 21 and 31, that His mother\nand brethren set out to lay hands on Him, bringing on themselves the\nrebuke of verses 32-35. See under Correspondence (page 384).\n\nJoh. 8:20.-“These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in\nthe Temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet\ncome.”\n\nThis Epicrisis is used to show how easily (humanly speaking) He\nmight have been taken where there were so many people assembled.\nJoh. 8:27.-“They understood not that he spake unto them of the\nFather.”\n\nBy means of this additional explanatory conclusion, we are made\nastonished at the unbelief and blindness of the Jews. See 12:37.\nJoh. 9:14.-“And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay,\nand opened his eyes.”\n\nThe Epicrisis here explains much concerning the events recorded\nin this chapter.\n\nJoh. 9:22.-“These words spake his parents, because they feared the\nJews:” etc.\n\nThis is added to explain the action of the parents of the man born\nblind.\n\nJoh. 10:22-23.-“And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication,\nand it was winter, and Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon\'s\nPorch.”\n\nThis is added to show that Christ happened to be at that feast, and\nthat he had not gone up to it as to the other feasts. After He had\naccomplished His journey to the feast of Tabernacles (7:8), He made a\ndelay there, so as to remain over the feast of Dedication. (For this\nfeast, see 1Ma. 4:59). See page 455.\nJoh. 11:13.-“Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that\nhe had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.”\n\nThis Epicrisis is used to explain the meaning of what the Lord\nJesus had said.\nJoh. 11:30.-“Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in\nthat place where Martha met him.”\n\nThis explanation is needed to enable us to understand the course\nof events.\nJoh. 12:33.-\"This he said, signifying what death he should die.”\nJoh. 12:37.-“But though he had done so many miracles before them,\nyet they believed not on him.”\nAct. 19:20.-“So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.”\n1Jn. 3:1.-After the words “sons of God,” the best Texts with R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] add καὶ ἐσμεν (kai esmen), and\nwe are; or, and such we are.

[Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] “some\nfew men.”\n\nPro. 3:25.-“Be not afraid of fear suddenly”: i.e., sudden fear.\n\nPro. 15:24.-“The way of life is above, to the wise, that he may depart\nfrom sheol beneath”: i.e., the lower Sheol.\n\nPro. 24:28.-“Be not a witness against thy neighbour heedlessly”: a\nrash, and hence likely to be, a false witness.\n\nPro. 27:1.-“Boast not thyself of to-morrow’: i.e., of any future day.\n\nMat. 6:34.-“Be not full of care for to-morrow”: i.e., have, then, no\nanxiety for any future day.\n\nJoh. 15:5.-“Without (or apart from) me ye can do nothing”: /е.,\nsevered from me.\n\n2Со. 4:16.-“Though our without (/е., external or outward) man perish,\nyet the within ({:6., internal or inward) man is renewed day by day.”\n2Co. 4:17.-“For our momentary lightness of tribulation (i.e., light\ntribulation) worketh for us exceedingly excessively an eternal weight of\nglory”: {Θ., an excessively surpassing eternal weight of glory.” R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] “more and more exceedingly.”\nIll. Antimereia of the Adjective\n\n1. Adjective for Adverb\nAct. 16:37.-“They have beaten us in public”: i.e., publicly.\n1Co. 12:11.-“Dividing to each one personally”: i.e., severally.\n\n2. Adjective for Noun\n\nGen. 1:9-10.-“Let the dry appear”: i.e., the land. So Psa. 95:5; and, in\nthe Greek, Mat. 23:15.\nIsa. 24:23.-“Then the pale shall be confounded”: ᾖθ., the moon,\nbecause pale.\nRom. 1:15.-τὸ kat’ ἐμὲ πρόθυμον” (to kat’ eme prothumon),\naccording to my ready [mind], i.e., my readiness.\nRom. 1:19.-“The known (i.e., knowable or discoverable) of God”: i.e.,\nthat which may be learnt even by the natural man.\nRom. 2:4.-“Not knowing the kind [thing or giff] of God”: i.e., the\nkindness of God.\n\n1Co. 1:27-28.-‘Foolish,” “weak,” “base,” “despised”: i.e., as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] , “the foolish things,” etc.\n\n2Co. 8:8.-“To prove the genuine of your love”: i.e., the genuineness\n(or genuine character of).\n\nEph. 6:12.-“The spiritual [powers, bands, hosts] of wickedness”: {6.,\nwicked spirits.\n\nPhp. 2:6.-“Equal with God”: {6., on an equality with God.\n\nThis is what the first man grasped at, tempted and deceived by the\nOld Serpent. But Christ, the second man, the last Adam, did not think\nit a matter to be grasped at in this way, “but humbled Himself,” and\nthrough suffering and death reached His exaltation. (See pages 202,\n433).\n\nPhp. 4:5.-“Let your moderate be known unto all men”: i.e., your\nmoderation.\n\nHeb. 6:17.-“The unchangeable of his counsel”: ie., the\nunchangeableness of His counsel, or the unchangeable [character] of\nHis counsel.\nIV. Antimereia of the Noun\n1. A Noun for a Verb\nThis is called “Antimereia of the Noun.”\nJdg. 16:23.-“Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together\nfor to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their God, and to rejoice.” Lit,\nfor a great rejoicing.\nIsa. 7:1.-“Rezin ... and Pekah ... went up toward Jerusalem to war\nagainst it.”\nLit., for the war. Fig., to make war.\nMar. 12:38.-“And he said unto them in his doctrine.” Here, the noun\n“doctrine” is put instead of the verb, “during his teaching” or, “while he\ntaught.”\n2. A Noun for an Adverb\nIsa. 21:7.-“And he hearkened diligently with much heed”: i.e., most\nattentively.\nPsa. 75:2 (3).-“I will judge upright [judgments]”: i.e., righteously. So\nPro. 31:9.\nPsa. 139:14.-“I will praise thee, for | am made with fears and wonder’:\nie., fearfully and wonderfully.\nLam. 1:8.-“Jerusalem hath sinned a sin”: i.e., grievously.\nMar. 7:3.-“Except they wash their hands with the fist”: {6., carefully or\nassiduously.\nMar. 8:32.-“And he spake the word with boldness”: i.e., boldly, openly,\nor publicly. So Joh. 7:26; Joh. 10:24; Joh. 11:14; Joh. 16:25; Joh.\n16:29; Joh. 18:20; Joh. 11:54.\n3. A Noun for an Adjective\n\nThus “circumcision” and “uncircumcision” are used instead of\ncircumcised or uncircumcised persons.\n\nAnathema, which means accursed, is an accursed or\nexcommunicated person or thing.\n1Co. 14:12.-“So also ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spirits.”\nHere, the noun is used instead of an adjective (πνευμάτων for\nπνευματικῶν). Both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] insert “gifts” in italics.\n1Со. 14:32.-“And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the\nprophets.” Here, the noun “spirits” is again used for the adjective\nSpiritual gifts. See under Metonymy.\nGal. 1:14.-“Being more exceedingly a zealot”: i.e., zealous, as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n16111]\nHeb. 12:11.-“Any discipline for the present (time) seems not to be of\njoy” (xapdc, charas): i.e. joyous, “but of grief’ (λύπης, /ирее5): {9.,\ngrievous, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.]\n1Jn. 5:6.-“Because the Spirit is truth.” Here the noun is rendered\nliterally: but it is used by the figure Antimereia for the adjective true;\nand the meaning is that the witness of the Holy Spirit concerning\nChrist is true in every place and in every particular.\n\nIf this figure were not Enallage, then it would be a Metaphor, which\nis quite out of the question.\n4. A Noun (repeated) for an Adjective\nA noun is sometimes repeated in order to express the adjective in the\nhighest or superlative degree. This is called Geminatio or Epizeuxis\n(q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).\nIsa. 26:3.-“Thou wilt keep him in peace, peace”: i.e., perfect peace.\nSee under Epizeuxis, where many examples are given.\n\n5. A. Noun (in regimen) for an Adjective\n\nWhen, of two nouns, one noun is placed in regimen: i.e., when one\ngoverns the other in the genitive case: the latter word (sometimes two\nwords) becomes an adjective.\n\nThe natural and ordinary way of qualifying a noun is by using an\nadjective. But, if it is wished to emphasize the adjective, then this rule\nis departed from; in order to attract the attention of the reader, and to\ntell him that the adjective is very emphatic, and is to be read as if it\nwere underlined or under-scored in ordinary writing. For example:\nsuppose we are speaking of Angels, and our thought is simply of them\nand their being, we should use the word “mighty” as an adjective, and\nsay “Mighty ANGELS,” but if we wished to emphasize the adjective\n“mighty,” and call attention to the fact that we are not referring to\nangels as such, but to their wondrous power, and we should say\n“MIGHTY Angels.” How is this to be done? By Antimereia. By using a\nnoun instead of an adjective, and saying “Angels of might.”\n\nIt is difficult to say how this should be dealt with in translation so as\nto render it idiomatically, and yet apprise the reader of the correct\nemphasis.\nNeither the Authorized nor the Revised Version follows any fixed\nrule. Sometimes the noun is translated literally, and sometimes it is\nrendered as an adjective.\n\nIt is important, however, that the reader (especially the public\nreader) should know where the emphasis is required.\n\nIt should be observed, however, that the second noun (i.e., the\nnoun in the genitive case) is not always used instead of an adjective.\n\nThe word “of” takes many different meanings; and it is important\nthat each should be accurately defined and determined.\n\nAs this, however, does not belong strictly to the figure Antimereia,\nwe have given an outline of the whole subject in the Appendix. (See\nAppendix B “On the usuage of the Genitive case.”)\n\nThe following are examples of Antimereia, where a noun in\nregimen is used instead of an adjective:-\n\nExo. 34:7.-“The iniquity of the fathers”: {6., when the iniquity wrought\nby the children is the same in character, it will he punished in the\nsame way.\n\n2Ki. 24:3.-“The sins of Manasseh”: {6., the sins like Manasseh’s, as is\nexplained by the next sentence, “according to all that he did.”\n\n2Ch. 24:6; 2Ch. 24:9.-“The collection of Moses”: i.e., like that ordered\nby Moses. The italics of the A.V.

Hence, used always of angels in the Old Testament.\n\nSee every other occurrence:- Job. 1:2; Job. 2:6; Job. 38:7. Psa.\n29:1; Psa. 89:6. Dan. 3:25.

[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] margin): i.e., immensely powerful.\nThe word “sons” or “children” with a noun (in regimen) is used\nidiomatically:-\n\nThe word “son,” when qualified by another noun, denotes the\nnature and character of the person or persons so named, and even\ntheir source and origin: e.g., “sons of Belial” (margin, naughty men).\nDeu. 13:13. Jdg. 19:22.\n\n“Sons of valour” (2Sa. 2:7. 1Ki. 1:52. Deu. 3:18): /е., brave\nmen.\n\n“Sons of the pledges”: i.e., hostages (2Ki. 14:14).\n\n“Son of oil” (Isa. 5:1, marg. [Note: arg.

[Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] margin: “But we are not [children of unbelief]\nof drawing back unto destruction of the soul ({6., unbelievers), but\n[children] of faith (i.e., believers) unto the gaining of it.”\n\nSo the expression “son of man,” “sons of men,” “children of men”\nis a Hebrew idiom for a human being as distinct from a beast on the\none hand and from God or angelic beings on the other (Gen. 11:5,\netc.).\nIn like manner the “sons of God” in the New Testament are those\nwho partake of the New, Divine, or spiritual nature (2Pe. 1:4), whether\nangels or men, as distinct from the beasts and from mere human\nbeings.\n\nBeni Ha-Elohim, the sons of God, is used seven times in the Old\nTestament for angels (see above).\nOnce it is used of Restored Israel (Hos. 1:10) in Heb. 2:1, but here\nthe expression is different, Beni El-hai.\n\nIn the singular with both articles it is used of Christ.\n\n“The Son of God” is that blessed one who is perfect man and\nperfect God, perfectly human as “the Son of man” (also with both\narticles) and perfectly Divine as “the Son of God.”\n\n6. Noun (governing) for Adjective\nWhen the first noun (instead of the second noun, in regimen) is\nchanged, and used instead of the adjective, the figure is called\nHypallage. See below.\n7. The former of Two Nouns (both in regimen) used for an\nAdjective\n\nWhen two nouns are both of them in regimen, and only one of them is\nused for the adjective, sometimes it is the former* [Note: Sometimes it\nis the latter that is put for the adjective.

The /atter of Two Nouns (both in regimen) used for an Adjective\nGen. 9:5.-“At the hand of a man of his brother”: i.e., at the hand of his\nfellow or brother man. There is no “every” expressed in the Hebrew.\nRom. 3:23.-“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”:\nie., of God’s glory.\n\nRom. 8:3.-“In likeness of flesh of sin”: i.e., sinful flesh’s likeness.\n\nCol. 1:11.-“According to the power of the glory of Him”: i.e., according\n\nto His glorious power.\n\nCol. 1:13.-“And hath translated us into the kingdom of the son of His\n\nlove”: {6., His beloved Son’s kingdom. See Mat. 3:17.\n\n9. One of two Nouns in the same case (and not in regimen) used\nfor an Adjective\n\nWhen two nouns in the same case are united by a conjunction, one of\nthem (generally the latter) is used as a very emphatic adjective, e.g.,\nAct. 14:13 : “They brought oxen and garlands,” means “They brought\noxen, yes, and they were garlanded too!” This figure is called\nHendiadys, under which the reader will find many examples.\n10. Noun (in regimen) for superlative of Adjective\n\nWhen the latter noun is the genitive plural of the former noun e.g.,\nKing of Kings, Holy of Holies, it is put instead of, and to emphasise,\nthe superlative degree of the adjective. As this is a species of\nPolyptoton, we have put the examples under that figure (q.v. [Νοίε:\nWhich see_] ).',''),(106,106,'antiptosis','Exo. 19:6.-“A kingdom of priests”: i.e., a royal priesthood. In 1Pe. 2:9,\nthis is put literally, instead of (as here) by Antiptosis.\n\nPsa. 1:1.-“O the blessedness or happinesses of the man”: i.e., the\nhappy or blessed man.\n\nMat. 13:5.-“No depth of earth”: /.e., no deep earth.\n\nLuk. 1:48.-“The low estate of his handmaiden”: i.e., his humiliated\nbondmaid: referring to the humiliation to which she had to be subject.\nIf even Joseph could suspect her, however sorrowfully and sadly, what\nwould others do? What, in fact, in Jewish teaching still!\n\nLuk. 5:9.-“At the haul of the fish”: i.e., the fish of the capture; or, the\ncaptured fishes.\n\nRom. 2:4.-“The good thing (τὸ χρηστόν, to chreeston) of God”: i.e.,\nthe goodness of God. See under Antimereia of the adjective.\n\nRom. 5:17.-“The abundance of the grace”: i.e., the abounding grace.\n1Co. 1:17.-“Not with wisdom of speech”: i.e., not with learned or\neloquent language.\n\n1Со. 1:21.-“The folly of preaching”: i.e., foolish (as the wise Gentiles\nironically called it) preaching.\n\n1Со. 14:12.-\"So do ye also, since as ye are zealous of spirits.” Here,\nthe noun “spirits” is used for the adjective spiritual (πνευμάτων,\nрпеитайфл for πνευματικῶν, pneumatikebn). Both the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] insert the word “gifts” in\nitalics. See under Metonymy.\n\n2Co. 8:8.-“The genuineness of your love”: i.e., your genuine love.\n\nGal. 3:14.-‘The promise of the Spirit’: i.e., the promised Spirit.\nGal. 4:4.-“The fulness of the time”: {6., the full or completed time.\nEph. 1:7.-“The riches of his grace.” By Enallage this would be\ngracious riches, but it means more than this. Grace is the subject, and\nit is the exceeding wealth of this wondrous grace which has abounded\ntoward those who are “accepted in the Beloved.”\n\nBy Antiptosis the one is put for the other, and the noun “riches” is\nput for the adjective: i.e., His exceeding rich grace. So also\nEph. 1:18.-“The riches of his glory’ denotes the exceeding rich glory\nof His inheritance in the saints.\nEph. 4:29.-“Building up or edifying of the need.” The A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nrenders this-“Use of edifying;” but it is the word “use” (or need) which\nis in the genitive case, and not the word “edifying.” The R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “Edifying as the need may be.”\n\nBut by the figure of Antiptosis (which neither Version perceived),\nthe former noun is used for the adjective, instead of the latter in the\ngenitive case.\n\nThe meaning, therefore, is “that which is good for edifying use.”\nPhp. 4:5.-“The immutability of his counsel”: i.e., his immutable\ncounsel.\nCol. 1:27.-“The riches of the glory”: i.e., His wondrously rich glory, in\nthe mystery revealed to and through Paul.\n1Th. 1:3.-“Work of faith,” “labour of love,” and “patience of hope.”\n\nWe have given these under the genitive of origin (see Appendix B):\ni.e., work which proceeds from faith, labour which proceeds from love,\nand patience that proceeds from hope.\n\nThe genitive, however, may be, by Antimereia, faithful service,\nloving labour, and hopeful patience.\n\nBut, if the figure is Antiptosis, then it means a working faith (i.e., a\nfaith which is manifested by its works), a laborious love, and patient\nhope. Probably all three interpretations are correct!\n\nHeb. 6:17.-“The immutability of his counsel”: i.e., His unchangeable\ncounsel.”\n\nHeb. 9:15.-“The promise of the eternal inheritance”: {6., the promised\neternal inheritance.\n\n1Pe. 3:20.-“The longsuffering of God”: i.e., the longsuffering God.\n\nThere are other exchanges of case beside that of the absolute for\nthe construct. But these are for the most part peculiar to Greek usage.\nLuk. 1:55.-“As he spake to (πρός) our fathers, to Abraham (τῷ\nΑβραάμ), and to his seed (τῷ).” Here, the fathers is in the Accusative\nbecause more general; while Abraham, etc, is in the Dative, because\nmore personal\nHeb. 10:5.-“A body hast thou prepared me (Dat. μοί (moi), for me).”\n\nIt is a question whether the Dative is used, by Antiptosis, for the\n\nAccusative; to show that, while Christ’s human body was prepared for\nHim, yet He was also constituted a servant for ever according to Exo.\n21:6 and Deu. 15:17. This is the sense in Psa. 40:6 (7), and σῶμα\n(sqma), body, was used of slaves (Rev. 18:13), just as we use\n“hands” of labourers.\nRev. 1:5-6.-“And from Jesus Christ (Gen. [Νοίε: en. The Genitive\nCase_] ), the faithful witness (Nom. [Note: om. The Nominative Case.]\n), and the first begotten (Nom. [Note: om. The Nominative Case.] )\nfrom the dead ... to him (Dat.) that loved us ... and made us (Nom.\n[Note: om. The Nominative Case.] ) kings, etc., to him (Dat.).” All this\nchange of cases seems to overwhelm us with the idea of the\nimpossibility of expressing the praise and glory which should be\nascribed to Jesus Christ.\n\nSee also (in the Greek) Rev. 3:12; Rev. 18:13.',''),(107,107,'heterosis','|. Of Forms and Voices\n1. Intransitive for Transitive\nMat. 5:29.-“If thy right eye offend thee”: (σκανδαλίζω, skandalizq), to\nmake to stumble: i.e., make thee stumble. So Mat. 18:6. 1Co. 8:13.\nMat. 5:45.-“He maketh his sun to rise” (ἀνατέλλω, anatellq), to rise\nup.\n\n1Co. 2:2.-“| determined not to know anything among you”: i.e., to\nmake known, preach.\n\n1Со. 3:6.-“God gave the increase,” and verse 7: “God that giveth the\nincrease.” So 2Co. 9:10. In all other places the verb αὐξάνω\n(аихапф), to increase, is intransitive.\n\n1Co. 13:12.-“Then shall | know, even as | also am known”: {6., | shall\nbe made to know or taught.\n\n2Co. 2:14.-“Now, thanks be to the God that always causeth us to\ntriumph.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] recognises the figure of exchange; as also\nin\n\n2Со. 9:8.-“God is able to make all grace abound in you.”\n\nGal. 4:9.-“But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known\nof God”: {6., been made to know, or been instructed by God.\n\nEph. 1:8.-“According to the riches (or wealth) of His grace which\n(grace) he hath made to overflow into us.”\n\n2Ti. 2:19.-“The Lord knoweth them that are his”: i.e., the Lord maketh\nknown who are His; as in Num. 16:5.\n\n2. Active for Passive\n1Pe. 2:6.-“Wherefore also it is contained in the Scriptures,” Jit, it\ncontains: i.e., there is a passage in the Scripture.\n\n3. Middle for Passive\nLuk. 2:5.-“To be taxed with Mary”: /it., to enrol himself.\n1Со. 10:2.-“And were all baptized into Moses”: lit, baptized\nthemselves.\n\nIl. Heterosis of Moods\n\n1. Indicative for Subjunctive\n\nAs the Hebrew language has no subjunctive mood, the indicative is\noften put instead of that mood; and this is done in the New Testament,\nas well as in the Old Testament, inasmuch as, though the language is\nGreek, the thoughts and idioms are Hebrew.\n1Co. 15:12.-“Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead,\nhow say some among you,” etc.: i.e., how is it that some among you\nsay.\n\nVerse 35. “But some men wilt say”: /.e., may say.\n\nVerse 50. “Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption”: i.e., neither\ncan corruption, etc.\n\n2. Subjunctive for Indicative\n\nMat. 11:6.-“Blessed is he who may not be made to stumble”: i.e., who\nis not made to stumble or seeth nothing to stumble at in me.\nJoh. 15:8.-“By this is my Father glorified, that ye may bear much fruit”:\nie., that ye bear or when ye bear, etc.\n1Co. 6:4.-“If, then, ye may have matters of judgment” (cases for the\njudge): i.e., if ye have.\nJam. 4:13.-“To-day or to-morrow we may go into such a city”: i.e., we\nwill go.\n\nVerse 15: “If the Lord should will, and we should live”: i.e., if He\nwilleth, and we live.\nSome Christians say, “If the Lord should tarry;” not perceiving that\nHe may tarry, and yet not will that we should live, or do this or that.\nTarrying and willing are two very different things.\n3. Imperative for Indicative\nGen. 20:7.-“For he (Abraham) is a prophet, and let him pray for thee”:\nie., (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] ), he shall pray for thee.\nGen. 42:18.-“This do ye and live”: i.e., and ye shall live.\nGen. 45:18.-‘I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye\nthe fat of the land”: {6., ye shall eat (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ).\nDeu. 32:50.-And be gathered unto thy people”: i.e., thou shalt be\ngathered.\nPsa. 22:8 (9).-“Roll thyself on, or trust thou in the Lord.”\n\nWhatever part of the verb aé (σφ!) may be, it must be-put for the\nindicative, for it is so rendered in the Septuagint (“He trusted in the\nLord”), and is so quoted in the New Testament (Mat. 27:43).\n\nPsa. 37:27.-“Depart from evil and do good: and dwell for evermore”:\nie., thou shalt dwell.\nPro. 3:4.-“So shalt thou find favour.”\nHere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] recognizes the figure, for the Heb. is imperative,\n“find.” But the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] misses it in 4:4. “Keep my commandments\nand live”: i.e., and thou shalt live.\n\nRom. 5:1.-“Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with\nGod.”\n\nHere the reading, according to the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] and the Textual critics, should be ἔχωμεν (imperative),\ninstead of ἔχομεν (indicative), as in the T.R. and A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] Alford,\nthough he recognizes the reading, and puts it in the text, yet bows to\nthe overwhelming evidence of the sense, and the context, and\ncontends for the Indicative. The simple solution is that this is one of\nthe instances, if the critics are right, in which the Imperative is used for\nthe Indicative, and though the text may say “let us have,” the meaning\nis “we have.”\n1Со. 16:22.-‘If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be\nAnathema Maran-atha”: i.e., he is or will be Anathema (or accursed)\nwhen the Lord shall come.\nIn prophetic utterances the future indicative is very often declared\nby the imperative; for “Whatsoever the Lord willeth, that doeth he.”\nIsa. 8:10.-“Take counsel together ... speak the word”: i.e., ye shall\ntake counsel together, and it will come to naught: and ye shall speak\nthe word, but it will not stand.” So also 29:9; 37:30; 54:1, etc.\nJoh. 2:19.-“Destroy this temple.” This was not a command for the\nJews to destroy Him, but a prophesy that they would do so. When\nthey perverted His words, they did not do so by taking the figure\nliterally, but by declaring that He said “I will destroy this temple.”\nGal. 6:2.-“And so fulfil (/.e., so ye will fulfil) the law of Christ.”\nJam. 5:1.-“Weep and howl:” i.e., ye shall weep and howl.\n\n4. Imperative for Subjunctive\n\nNum. 24:21.-“Strong be thy dwelling place, and build in the flint-rock\nthy nest. Nevertheless”: i.e., thou mayest put, but,” etc. A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] :\n“Thou puttest” (Ind. [Note: The Indicative Mood.] ), but the sense is\nsubjunctive.\nPsa. 4:4 (5).-“Stand in awe, and sin not”: i.e., if ye stand in awe ye will\nnot sin.\n\nNah. 3:14.-Here, all the imperative commands are conditional\ndeclarations, as is shown by verse 15: i.e., the people might do all\nthese things, nevertheless, it would be all in vain.\n\nLuk. 10:28.-“This do, and thou shalt live”: /.e., if thou do this. Hence\nthe Imperative very often implies only permission:-\n2Sa. 18:23.-“Run”: i.e., thou mayest run.\n1К!. 22:22.-“Со forth, and do 5ο”: i.e., thou mayest go, and do it.\n2Ki. 2:17.-“Send”: i.e., ye may send.\nMat. 8:32.-“Со”: i.e., ye may go.\n1Co. 7:15.-“Let him depart”: i.e., he may depart.\n1Co. 11:6.-“Let her also be shorn”: i.e., she may be shorn.\n\n5. Infinitive for Indicative\nGen. 8:5.-“And the waters were in going and returning”: i.e., as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] , decreased continually.\nExo. 8:15 (11).-“But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, and to\nharden his heart, and hearkened not unto them”: i.e., hardening of his\nheart followed, or took place.\n2Sa. 3:18.-“By the hand of my servant David to save my people\nIsrael”: i.e., | shall save.\n1Ki. 22:30 and 2Ch. 18:29.-“And the king of Israel said unto\nJehoshaphat: To disguise myself and to enter into the battle”: | will\ndisguise myself; or as in margin [when he was] to disguise, etc.\n\n2Ch. 31:10.-“Since the People began to bring the offerings into the\nHouse of the Lord, to eat, to be satisfied, and to have left plenty”: /.е.,\nwe have eaten, and had enough, and have left plenty.\n\nPsa. 8:1 (2).-“Who to set thy glory above the heavens”: who hast set.\nThe Targum and the Syriac have the Indicative (Num. 27:20).* [Note:\nSee the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible.]\n\nPsa. 32:9.-“Not to understand”: {6., having no understanding.\n\nPsa. 77:1 (2).-“Even unto God with my voice, and to hear me”: i.e.,\nand He gave ear to me, or He will hear me; or, by Ellipsis, and He [will\ncondescend] to hear me.\n\nPro. 12:6.-“The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood”: i.e., lie\nin wait.\n\nIsa. 5:5.-Here, the Infinitive is correctly rendered by the Indicative\nfuture: “I will take away, and break down,” etc.\n\nIsa. 38:16.-“So wilt thou recover me, and to make me to live”: i.e., and\nvivify me, or preserve my life.\n\nIsa. 49:7.-“To him to despise in soul”: i.e., to him who is despised by\nman.\n\nJer. 7:9.-“Will ye to steal, to murder,” etc. Some interpret the letter а\n(He) as interogative, but others as intensive, Will ye steal, etc. (with\nemphasis on the verbs).\n\nJer. 14:5.-“Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and to forsake it”: i.e.,\nand forsook it, because there was no grass; or, the sense may be\nsupplied by Ellipsis, and [was obliged] to forsake it, etc.\n\nEze. 1:14.-“And the living creatures to run and to return”: i.e., ran and\nreturned.\n\nEze. 11:7.-“To bring you forth”: i.e., | will bring you forth. “I shall bring”\nis actually the reading according to the Sevir, and indeed it is the\nTextual reading in some MSS., as well as the Editio princeps of the\nHebrew Bible (Soncino, 1488), and the marginal reading of the first\nedition of the Rabbinic Bible by Felix Pratensis (Venice, 1517), as may\nbe seen from the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Edition of the Hebrew Bible.\nHab. 2:15.-“To make him drunk”: /е., and makest him drunken also\n(as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] ).\n6. Infinitive for Imperative\nExo. 20:8.-“To remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy”: ie.,\nremember thou. So Deu. 5:12.\nLuk. 9:3.-“Neither to have two coats”: {6., neither have ye.\nRom. 12:15.-“To rejoice with them that rejoice”: i.e., rejoice ye. See\nunder Homeeoteleuton.\nPhp. 3:16.-“To walk by the same rule”: i.e., let us walk, or walk ye.\n\nOther examples may be seen in Jos. 1:13. Job. 32:10 (11). Psa.\n\n17:5; Psa. 22:8 (9). Isa. 32:11. Jer. 2:2.\n\nIll. Heterosis of the Tenses\nAs the Hebrew verb has only two principal tenses, the past and the\nfuture, these two with the participles supply all the other tenses.\nHence, in the New Testament, where the thought and idiom are\nHebrew, though the tenses are Greek they consequently have all the\nvariety which these tenses have in Hebrew.\n\n1. The Past for the Present\nThe Past not only serves to express what is finished or past, but what\nis present: regarding it, and also the future, as actually done. The past\ntense expresses what is either imperfect or perfect, or what is a gentle\nimperative, or a fixed determination, or a continuation of the action or\nstate. The exact sense can be known only from the context.\nGen. 4:1.-“I have gotten a man from the Lord”: i.e., | have got, or,\npossess.\n\nVerse 9: “I have not known”: i.e. (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), | know not, or, |\ndo not know.\n\nGen. 23:11; Gen. 23:13.-“I have given thee the field”: {6., | give to\nthee the field.\nGen. 32:10 (11).-“I have been unworthy of all the mercies”: i.e., | am\nunworthy.\n\n2Sa. 1:5.-“How hast thou known ({6., how dost thou know) that Saul\nand Jonathan his son are dead?”\n\n2Ki. 3:11.-“Here is Elisha, son of Shaphat, who hath poured ({6.,\npoureth) water on the hands of Elijah.” Elijah’s servant is described by\npart of his service (this is by the figure of Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:\nWhich see_] ).\n\nPsa. 1:1.-“O the happiness of that one who hath not walked (i.e., doth\nnot (and never did) walk),” etc.\n\nPsa. 14:1.-“The fool hath said ({6., sayeth) in his heart, There is no\nGod.” If this Psalm refers to Nabal (a foo/), we may render it: “Nabal\nsaid” or “A fool sayeth.”\n\nPsa. 25:2.-“My God, in thee | have trusted:” {6., do | trust. So Psa.\n31:1 (2). Pro. 17:5; and in many other places: the sense being, “I have\ntrusted, and still do trust, in Thee.”\n\nPsa. 31:6.-“Thou hast delivered (i.e., thou deliverest) me, О Jehovah.”\nIsa. 9:2 (1).-“The People who walk in darkness have seen (i.e., see) а\ngreat light.”\nJoh. 1:4.-“In him was (i.e., is) life, and the life was (i.e., is) the light of\nmen.”\n\nVerse 15: “This was (i.e., is) he of whom | spake.”\nJoh. 3:16.-“God so loved (i.e., loveth) the world, that he gave ({6.,\ngiveth) his only begotten Son.”\nJoh. 9:36.-“Who is he, Lord, that | shall have believed (i.e., may\nbelieve) on him.”\nJoh. 20:17.-“Hold me not, for | have not yet ascended”: i.e., | do not\nyet ascend, or am not yet ascended.\nAct. 12:14.-Rhoda “told Peter to be standing before the porch”: i.e.,\nhow Peter is standing.\nRom. 5:2.-“This grace wherein ye have stood”: i.e., and continue to\nstand.\n1Со. 1:10.-“In whom we have hoped (and continue to hope).”\nHeb. 10:11.-“And every high priest stood (i.e., standeth) daily” (as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] ).\nJam. 1:24.-“He beheld himself, and has gone away”: ie., he\nbeholdeth himself, and goeth his way.\n1Jn. 3:6.-“Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him”:\nie., seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.\n\nOther examples may be seen in Joh. 5:45; Joh. 11:27; Joh. 16:27.\n1Ti. 4:10; 1Ti. 5:5.\n\n2. The Past for the Future\n\nThis is put when the speaker views the action as being as good as\ndone. This is very common in the Divine prophetic utterances: where,\nthough the sense is literally future, it is regarded and spoken of as\nthough it were already accomplished in the Divine purpose and\ndetermination: the figure is to show the absolute certainty of the things\nspoken of.\nGen. 45:9-10.-“Haste ye and go up to my father, then ye have said\n(i.e., will say) to him ... and thou hast dwelt (i.e., wilt dwell) in the land\nof Goshen.”\n\nExo. 17:4.-“They have stoned me”: i.e., they will stone me.\n\n1Sa. 2:31.-“Lo, the days are coming, and | have cut off thine arm”: i.e.,\nshall cut off, etc.\n\n1Sa. 10:2.-“Thou hast found”: i.e., wilt find.\n\n1Sa. 6:7-8.-“And ye have bound (i.e., will bind),” etc.\n\nJob. 19:27.-“And mine eyes have beheld?” (i.e., will have seen).\n\nPsa. 23:5.-“Thou hast anointed”: {.6., wilt anoint.\n\nPsa. 107:42.-“And all iniquity hath shut ({6., will have shut) her\nmouth.”\n\nPro. 1:22.-“The scorners have delighted (i.e., will delight) in their\nscorning.”\n\nPro. 11:7; Pro. 11:21.-“The hope of the unjust men hath perished”:\nie., will perish: but just one’s seed hath escaped: {6., will escape.\n\nPro. 12:21.-“And the wicked have been (i-e., will be) full of evil.”\nJer. 21:9.-“Whosoever goeth forth and hath fallen unto the\nChaldeans”: i.e., shall fall, etc.\n\nAs we have said above, nearly all the prophecies are thus written.\nSee Isa. 11:1-16 : “And a rod hath come out of the stock of Jesse,”\nand often through the chapter.\n\nJoh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended up into the heaven”: i.e. ascend\nup, or can ascend.\n\nJoh. 4:38.-“Other men laboured, and ye have entered (i.e. shall enter,\nor are entered) into their labours.”\n\nRom. 8:30.-The called are spoken of as already (in the Divine\npurpose) in Christ, justified, yea, even glorified.\n\nEph. 2:6.-Believers are regarded as already raised from the dead and\nseated in the heavenly places.\n\nHeb. 2:7.-“Thou hast made (i.e., Thou wilt make) Him for a little while\nless than the angels.” For this was a prophecy spoken of Christ long\nbefore, in Psa. 8:1-9\n\nHeb. 3:14.-“We have been made (i.e., we shall become) partakers of\nChrist, if we hold,” etc.\n\nHeb. 12:22.-“But ye have come (i.e., shall come) unto Mount Zion,”\netc.\n3. The Aorist for the Past\n\nThe Aorist, or indefinite past tense, is used to denote an action\ndefinitely past and completed some time ago.\nMat. 14:3.-“Now Herod, having laid hold of John, bound him”: i.e., had\nbound him.\nJoh. 18:24.-“New Annas sent him (i.e., had sent him) bound unto\nCaiaphas.”\n\n4. The Aorist for the Present\nThe Aorist is sometimes put for a past action or state continued up to\nthe present time.\nMat. 3:17.-“This is my beloved son, in whom | was (i.e., was and am)\nwell pleased.” So Mar. 1:11, and Luk. 3:22.\nMat. 23:2.-“The Scribes and Pharisees sat ({6., and continue to sit) in\nMoses’ seat.”\nΜατ. 16:19.-“Was taken up into heaven, and sat (/е., sat and\ncontinues to sit) on the right hand of God.”\nLuk. 1:47.-“My spirit rejoiced”: i.e., hath rejoiced and doth rejoice. A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n16411, “hath rejoiced.”\nLuk. 15:16.-“And he was longing to have filled”: i.e., to fill.\nJoh. 1:12.-“To them gave he authority to have become (i.e., to\nbecome, or that they might be) sons of God.”\n1Jn. 4:8.-“He that loveth not, knew not (i.e., knoweth not, or never\nknew) God.”\nJoh. 11:56.-“What think ye, that he will not have come (i.e., there is no\nhope of his coming) to the feast?”\nJoh. 15:6.-“Except anyone abide in me he was cast out (i.e., will be\ncast out), and was ({:6., will be) burned.” See under Ellipsis.\n\n5. The Present for the Past\nMat. 2:13.-“And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the\nLord appeareth ({6., appeared).”\nMar. 2:4.-“They are letting down the bed”: i.e., they did let down. See\nalso chaps, Mar. 3:19-20, Mar. 3:31 and Mar. 16:2.\nJoh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended into heaven, but the Son of man\nwho is (i.e., who was) in heaven.” Note that the perfect of the first verb\nis used for the future, as already observed above.\nAct. 9:26.-“They were all afraid of him, not believing (or refusing to\nbelieve) that he is ({6., was. So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) a disciple.”\nGal. 2:14.-“But when | saw that they do (i.e., did) not walk uprightly.”\nHeb. 2:16.-“For not, indeed, of angels’ nature He taketh ({6., took)\nhold, but of Abraham’s seed He taketh ({6., took) hold.”\nHeb. 7:3.-“He remaineth (i.e., remained) a priest all his life.”\nHeb. 7:8.-“One testified of that he liveth” (i.e., that he lived, viz., a\npriest) all his life. See above.\n\n6. The Present for the Future\nThis is put when the design is to show that some thing will certainly\ncome to pass, and is spoken of as though it were already present.\nMat. 2:4.-“Demanded of then where Christ should be (i.e., is to be)\nborn.”\nMat. 3:10.-“Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn\ndown”: i.e., will be hewn down.\nMat. 5:46.-“What reward have ye?” i.e., will ye have?\nMat. 17:11.-“Elias indeed cometh (i.e., will come) first.”\nMat. 26:29.-“Until the day when | drink ({6., shall be drinking) it with\nyou new,” etc.\nMar. 9:31.-“The Son of man is delivered ({6., will be delivered) unto\nthe hands of men.”\nLuk. 13:32.-“And the third day | am (i.e., shall be) perfected.”\n1Co. 15:2.-“By which also ye are (i.e., will be) saved.”\n1Со. 15:12.-“How say some among you that there is (i.e., will or can\nbe) no resurrection of the dead?”\n2Pe. 3:11.-“Seeing that all these things are (i.e., shall be) dissolved.”\n2Pe. 3:12.-“And the elements are (i.e., shall be) melted.”\n\nOther examples may be seen in Mat. 11:3. Joh. 7:27; Joh. 7:33-34;\nJoh. 8:58; Joh. 10:17-18; Joh. 12:26; Joh. 12:34; Joh. 13:6; Joh.\n13:27; Joh. 16:16. Act. 1:6. 1Co. 15:35; 1Co. 16:5. Rev. 11:5, etc., etc.\n7. The Present for the Paulo post futurum*\n[Note: This tense differs from the simple or perfect future by denoting\nand referring to something which will soon be past.]\n\nMat. 26:24.-“The Son of man indeed goeth (i.e., will soon be gone, or\ngiven over), as it is written of Him.”\n\nSo verse 45. Mar. 14:41. Luk. 22:22; Luk. 22:37. Joh. 13:3; Joh.\n14:3; Joh. 14:18-19; Joh. 17:11, ete.\nLuk. 22:19.-“Which is given (i.e., which will soon have been given) for\nyou.”\n\nSo also Mat. 26:28. Mar. 14:24. 1Co. 11:24.\nLuk. 24:49.-“Behold, | send (i.e., | shall soon have sent) the promise\nof my Father,” etc. So also Joh. 20:17.\n2Ti. 4:6.-“For | already am being poured (or offered)”: i.e., | shall soon\nhave been offered up.\n\n8. The Future for the Past\n\nThe future is used for the past when it is understood that the thing or\nmatter was future at the time of writing or speaking.\nExo. 15:5.-“The depths will cover ({.6., have covered and will continue\nto cover) them.”\n\nJdg. 2:1.-“I shall make (i.e., | made) you to go up out of Egypt and\nshall bring (i.e., have brought) you into the land which | sware unto\nyour fathers.” When the angel spake this it was past: when Jehovah\nsaid it, it was future.\n\nJdg. 5:8.-“He (i.e., Israel) will choose (i.e., he chose) new Gods.” For\nDeborah is speaking of the cause of the affliction which had fallen\nupon the People: viz., idolatry.\n\nJdg. 21:25.-‘Each man will do (i.e., did) what was right in his own\neyes.”\n2Sa. 3:33.-“And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Will Abner\ndie as a fool dieth?” (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , Died Abner, etc.).\n2Sa. 12:3.-“She will (i.e., did) eat of his own meat, and will drink ({6.,\ndrank) of his own cup, and will lie (i.e., lay) in his bosom, and so she\nbecame unto him as a daughter.”\nIsa. 63:3.-“I shall tread ({6., | have trodden) ...” as in the rest of the\nverse.\n\n9. The Future for the Present\nThis is a case in which what was then future at the time of speaking,\nremained, or remains, as a present fact. The present in this case is\noften in the subjunctive or reflexive mood.\nGen. 2:10.-“And thence it will part (i.e., gets parted, or parts itself) and\nbecomes four heads.”\nNum. 18:7.-“I shall give (i.e., | do give) your priest’s office unto you as\na service of gift”: {6., the gift at the time of speaking was future; but,\nministry remains an ever present gift.\nJob. 3:20.-“Wherefore will light be given to him that is in misery?” (i.e.,\nis light given).\nPsa. 1:2.-“And in His Law he will (i.e., doth) meditate.” So Psa. 3:5 (6);\n22:2 (3); 25:1; 31:5 (6). Hos. 1:2, etc.\nMat. 12:31.-“Every sin and blasphemy will be ({6., may be) forgiven to\nmen.\nLuk. 6:7.-“Whether he will heal (i.e., whether he does heal) on the\nsabbath day.” Here the Critical Texts actually read the present tense,\nas in the next passage (Luk. 23:46).\nLuk. 23:46.-“Father, into thy hands | shall commend (i.e., | commend)\nmy spirit.”\nRom. 3:30.-“Seeing it is one God which shall (i.e., doth) justify.”\n10. The Future for the Imperative\n\nThe Future of the Indicative is by Hebrew idiom frequently used for the\nImperative. When this is the case, the Imperative is very forcible and\nemphatic; not being so much a mere command as the assertion of a\nfact which could hardly be otherwise. All the ten commandments are\nin this form.\n\n“Thou wilt not’ not merely “shalt not.”\nJdg. 5:21.-“O my soul, thou wilt tread down strength”: i.e., tread thou\ndown (not, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] ‚ “hast trodden down’); or, Μ.Μ. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] : “march on.”\nSo Psa. 5:11 (12).\n1Со. 5:13.-“Ye will put away (i.e., put away) from among yourselves\nthat wicked person.\n1Ti. 6:8.-“We shall be content”: {6., let us be content.\nIV. Heterosis of Person and Number (Verbs)\n\nIn order to make what is said more emphatic, Hebrew idiom\nsometimes changes the number and person of the verb. In most of\nthese cases the figure is correctly rendered in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , so\nthat we need only give a few examples which are there passed over.\n\n1. The First Person for the Third\nEcc. 3:18.-“I said in my heart according to the reasoning of the sons\nof men”: i.e., according to the reasoning of man, or human reasoning:\ni.e., man says in his heart.\n\nIn Rom. 7:1-25, Paul, though speaking in the first person, is saying\nwhat is true of all who share his experience: and not merely speaking\nof his own case as being peculiar or different from others.\n\nRom. 10:18.-“But | say.” Who says it? David! But by the Holy Spirit\nwhat David said is now repeated by Paul in the first person.\n\n2. The Second Person for the Third\nIsa. 1:29.-“They shall be ashamed for the oaks which ye (i.e., they)\nhave desired,” etc.\n\nFor they desired them, of course: yet the persons addressed were\nequally guilty and are thus by the sudden change of persons charged\nwith the same sin.\nIsa. 42:20.-“Seeing many things, but thou observest not”: (i.e., he\nobserves not) as in the rest of the verse.\nJer. 29:19.-“But ye (i.e., they) would not hear.”\nGal. 6:1.-“Ye that are spiritual restore such an one, in the spirit of\nmeekness, considering thyself (instead of yourselves).” This is in order\nto emphasize the fact that those who are thus addressed stand each\nin the same individual danger.\n\n3. The Third person for the First or Second\nGen. 49:4.-“Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then\ndefiledst thou it: he went (/.e., thou wentest) up to my couch.”\nIsa. 54:1.-Here the third person is rendered correctly in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] by\nthe second.\nLam. 3:1.-“I am the man, he hath (i.e., | have) seen affliction.”\nMic. 7:18.-Here we have “his” inheritance, after the address “like\nthee.”\n4. The Plural for the Singular\nGen. 29:27.-“Fulfil her week, and we ({6., I) will give thee this also for\nthy service.”\nNum. 22:6.-“Peradventure | shall prevail, that we (i.e., |) may smite\nthem.”\n2Sa. 16:20.-“Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among\nyou What shall we (i.e., 1) do?”\nJob. 18:2.-“How long will it be ere ye (i.e., thou) make an end of\nwords? mark, and afterwards we (i.e., |) will speak.”\nDan. 2:36.-“This is the dream; and we (i.e., |) will tell the interpretation\nthereof.”\nMar. 4:30.-“Whereunto shall we (i.e., |) liken the kingdom of God?”\nJoh. 3:11.-“We (i.e., |) speak that we (i.e., 1) know, and testify that we\n(i.e., 1) have seen; and ye receive not our (/.e., my) witness.”\nJoh. 21:24.-“And we (i.e., |) know that his testimony is true.”\nRom. 1:5.-“By whom we (i.e., |, Paul) have received grace and\napostleship.” (See also Hendiadys).\n1Ti. 2:15.-“She will be saved through the child-bearing if they (i.e.,\nand all her daughters) abide in faith,” etc.\n5. The Singular for the Plural\nNum. 32:25.-“Spake” is (sing) “he spake”: i.e., the tribe as composed\nof the children of Gad,” etc. It is put for the plural, “they spake”; and it\nshould really be “they spake” (viz., the children of Gad and the\nchildren of Reuben), according to the Sevir. This extra-official reading\nis the Textual reading in several MSS.; in the Samaritan Text, in the\nTargums of Jonathan and Onkelos, the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the\nVulgate. See the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible. So 1Sa. 16:4 :\ni.e., one particular elder spoke for all. But the sing. [Note: The Singular\nNumber.] is put for the plural: for here, again, according to the note in\nDr. Ginsburg’s Text, the verb should be in the plural. This is not only\nthe reading according to the Sevir, but it is in the Text of many MSS.,\nthe Editio princeps of the Prophets (Soncino, 1485-6), the first edition\nof the Hebrew Bible (1488), the Targum, the LXX. [Note: The\nSeptuagint Version (325 b.c.).] Syriac, and the Vulgate.\nSee also Est. 9:23. Job. 12:7. Psa. 73:7. Pro. 14:1; Pro. 14:9.\nV. Heterosis of Degree\nThe Hebrew has no degrees of comparison in the Adjective: hence\nother methods are adopted to express them.\n\nIn the New Testament, while the language is Greek, the thoughts\nand idioms are Hebrew; so that the Hebrew methods of comparison\nare frequently adopted; and thus we have, by the use of Enallage,\nseveral examples of exchange in the expression of Degree. (See\nunder Idiom).\n\n1. The Positive for the Comparative\nWhere the positive is used with the comparative particle ἤ (ee), than, it\nimplies that, though there may be in one sense a comparison, yet, in\nanother and true sense, there is really no comparison at all; for the\nuse of the positive declares that the one case is so, rather than the\nother, which is not so.\nPsa. 118:8-9.-“It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to put\nconfidence in man”: i.e., the one is good, the other is not; yea, it is\naccursed (see Jer. 17:5; Jer. 17:7).\nMat. 12:7.-1 will have mercy, and not sacrifice’: i.e., rather than\nsacrifice.\nMat. 18:8.-“It is good for thee”: {6., (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) it is better for\nthee, etc. But the meaning is that the one condition is good, and not\nthe other. Hence it is expressed “rather than the other.”\nMar. 3:4.-“Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-days or to do evil?”:\ni.eé., more lawful to do good than to do evil. The evil His enemies did\non the sabbath was in watching Him.\nLuk. 18:14.- tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather\nthan the other.”\n\nHere, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] has translated it not as a comparative, but as\npositive; supplying the word “rather,” which is quite correct. The\nthought being that, while there must be a comparison between the two\nmen, the one was justified and the other was not.\n\nThe whole parable is concerning justification and not about prayer.\nSee verse 9.\nJoh. 6:27.-“Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat\nthat endureth to eternal life”: i.e., labour more for the latter than for the\nformer, or rather than.\nJoh. 15:22.-“If | had not come and spoken to them, they had not had\nsin”: ᾖΘ., so much sin.\n1Co. 3:7.-“So neither is the planter anything, nor the waterer; but God\nthat maketh grow’: i.e., they were nothing in comparison with God.\n\n2. The Positive for the Superlative\n\n1Sa. 17:14.-“And David was the small one (i.e., the smallest): and the\nthree great ones (i.e., the greater or greatest three) followed Saul.”\n2Ch. 21:17.-“The small one (i.e., the smallest) of his sons.”\nJon. 3:5.-“From their great one (i.e., the greatest one among them) to\ntheir small (i.e., smallest) one.”\nMat. 5:19.-“Whosoever therefore shall break one of these shortest\ncommandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the\nkingdom of heaven, but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same\nshall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” See under\nSynceceiosis.\nHeb. 10:21.-“And having a great (i.e., highest) priest over the house of\nGod.”So Heb. 13:20.\n3. The Comparative for the Positive\n\n1Ti. 3:14.-“Hoping to come unto thee more quickly”: {Θ., soon; or, as\nin A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 16111], shortly.\n2Ti. 1:18.-“And in how many things he ministered to me in Ephesus\nthou knowest better’: {6., well; or (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), very well: i.e., to\nwell to need reminding of.\n\n4. The Comparative for the Superlative\nMat. 13:32.-“Which indeed is less than (or least of) all the seeds\n(which men sow in the fields).”\n\nMat. 18:1.-“Who then is greater in the kingdom of heaven”: or (as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] ), greatest.\n\nJoh. 10:29.-“My Father, which gave them me, is greater than (i.e.,\ngreatest of) all.”\n\n1Co. 13:13.-“But the greater (i.e., the greatest) of these is charity.”\n1Co. 15:19.-\"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all\nmen more ({6., most, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) miserable.”\n\n5. The Superlative for the Comparative\nJoh. 1:15.-“For he was first of me”: i.e., prior to me (A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] before\nme). So the word first is used in Mar. 6:21; Luk. 19:47; Act. 25:2; Rev.\n13:12; and perhaps Rev. 21:1 : “the former heaven and earth”; and\nRev. 20:6 : the former resurrection of the two foretold in the Old\nTestament and in the Gospels. Not necessarily the special\nresurrection of the Church of God revealed in 1Th. 4:16.\nJoh. 15:18.-“If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me first of\nyou”: i.e., before you. So 1Co. 14:30. 1Ti. 5:12.\n2Th. 2:3.-“Except there come the apostacy first”: {6., before it.\n1Jn. 4:19.-“We love Him because He first loved us”: i.e., before we\nloved Him.\n\nVI. Heterosis of Number\n1. The Singular for the Plural\nGen. 3:8.-“Hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God\namongst the tree (i.e., trees) of the garden”; or, perhaps, tree in the\nsense of tree-growth or “a wood” as we speak of a collection of trees.\nGen. 49:6.-“In their anger they slew a man (i.e., men) and in their self-\nwill they houghed an ox (i.e., oxen).”\nExo. 14:17.-Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] has taken the singular “chariot” as\nthough put for the plural. But it is a question whether it be so in this\ncase, owing to the alternate structure.\nа Pharaoh.\nb — Нб host.\nа Pharaoh\'s chariot.\nЬ — His horsemen.\nExo. 15:1; Exo. 15:21.-“The horse and his rider”: i.e., horses and their\nriders.”\nExo. 23:28.-“I shall send the hornet before thee”: {6., hornets (without\nthe article).\nLev. 11:2.-“This is the beast which ye shall eat”: ᾖ6., these are the\nbeasts, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.]\n\n2Co. 11:26.-“Dangers in the city (i.e., cities, or city-dangers), dangers\nin the wilderness ({.6., wildernesses, or wilderness-dangers).”\n\n1Со. 6:5.-“One who shall be able to judge between his brother”: {6.,\nhis brethren.\n\nSee also Num. 21:7; Num. 21:31. Deu. 20:19. 2Sa. 19:41 (42).\nPro. 17:22; Hos. 5:6. Jon. 2:3 (4), etc. And in New Testament, Rev.\n21:21, “street” for streets. Also often “demon” and “wicked ones”\nmeans all the demons and evil spirits. See Joh. 8:44, and Eph. 6:16.\n\nIn Pronouns the singular is frequently put for the plural. See Deu.\n21:10. Jos. 2:4. 2Ki. 3:3. Psa. 35:8. Php. 3:20.\n\n2. The Plural for the Singular\nThis is so put when great excellence or magnitude is denoted.\n\nOur attention is thus called to the importance of the thing or matter\nconcerning which the statement is made.\nGen. 4:10.-“Bloods”: i.e., much blood.\nLev. 19:24.-“It shall be holy to praise the Lord withal.” Heb. (margin), it\nshall be “holiness of praises to the Lord”: i.e., the fruit of a young tree\nwas not to be eaten for three years, but in the fourth year it was to be\ncounted as holy to the great praise and glory of Jehovah. See under\nProsopopesia.\n\nGen. 19:11.-“And they smote the men that were at the door of the\nhouse with the blindnesses”: i.e., with intense blindness (as in 2Ki.\n6:18, the only occurrences of this word).\n\n2Sa. 3:28.-“Bloods”: /е., much blood.\n\n1Ch. 28:3.-“Bloods”: i.e., much blood.\n\nPsa. 22:3 (4).-“O Thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel”: i.e., the\nloud or perfect praise.\nPsa. 28:8.-“The Lord is their strength, and he is the strength of\nsalvations”: {6., great saving strength or strength of great and mighty\nsalvation. The margin has “his strength,” but 6il stands for 6Nil\nwritten defective for plene, as is shown and preserved in some ancient\nversions and noted in R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nmargin.* [Note: See Dr. Ginsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible.] The\nmeaning thus is:-\n\n“Jehovah is the strength of his people,\n\nAnd He is the strength of great salvation of His anointed.”\nPsa. 42:5 (6), 11 (12); 43:5.-“l shall yet praise him for the helps or\nhealths”: {6., the wonderful help, great deliverance, or great salvation.\nPsa. 45:15 (16).-“With gladnesses and rejoicing shall they be\nbrought”: i.e., with great gladness and rejoicing.\nPsa. 47:6 (7).-“Praises”: i.e., great or loudest praise.\nPsa. 49:3 (4).-“My mouth shall speak wise things”: {6., great wisdom.\nPsa. 51:17 (19).-“The sacrifices of God”: the great sacrifice of God is\na broken spirit.\nPsa. 89:1 (2).-“I will sing of the mercies”: i.e., the great and wondrous\nmercy. So often in N.T., Rom. 12:1. 2Co. 1:3.\n\nPsa. 90:10.-“And if by reason of strengths (or excellencies)”: i.e., of\ngreat strength.\n\nPsa. 139:14.-‘I will confess thee, because that (with) wonders (i.e.,\nwith great wonder) | have been distinguished, and wonderful are thy\nworks.”\n\nPsa. 144:7.-“Send thine hands from above; rid me and deliver me”:\ni.e., send thy gracious protection and great delivering power.\n\nThe singular is actually the Textual reading, not only in some\nManuscripts, but in the Editio princeps of the Hagiographa (Naples,\n1486-7), the Targum, the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.).] , the Syriac, and the Vulgate. See Dr. Ginsburg’s note on this\npassage in his edition of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nSee under Anthropopatheia.\n\nEcc. 5:6 (7).-“Vanities”: i.e., great vanity.\n\nIsa. 26:2.-“Which keepeth truths”: i.e., the great and important truth of\nGod.\n\nIsa. 58:11.-“In droughts”: /.e., in great drought.\nJer. 22:21.-“| spake unto thee in thy prosperities (i.e., in thy great\nprosperity), but thou saidst, | will not hear.”\n\nLam. 1:9.-“Wonders”: i.e., a great wonder.\n\nLam. 3:22.-‘It is of the Lord’s mercies”: {6., great mercy.\n\nEze. 22:2.-“The city of the bloods”: i.e., the city where so much blood\nhas been shed.\n\nEze. 25:17.-“Vengeances”: i.e., great or terrible vengeance. See A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] margin and Psa. 94:1.\n\nEze. 28:10.-“Deaths”: i.e., the awful death.\n\nDan. 2:18.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.\n\nMat. 26:65.-“Then the High Priest rent his clothes”: i.e., his great robe\nof office.\n\nJoh. 1:13.-“Not of bloods”: {6., not of the best or purest blood; or not\nof the very best of human parents.\n\nAct. 1:7.-“Times or seasons”: i.e., the great and important time and\nseason. So 1Th. 5:1. 1Ti. 6:15. Tit. 1:3.\n\nRom. 12:1.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.\n1Со. 15:29.-It has been suggested that in this passage we have the\nplural for the singular. “What shall they do which are baptized for the\ndead?” (plural) /е., for Christ, who was put to death.\n\nBut see this passage under Ellipsis (page 41).\n2Co. 1:3.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.\nHeb. 9:12.-“Into the holies”: /.e., the most holy place.\nHeb. 9:23.-“With better sacrifices than these”: ie., one better and\ngreater sacrifice; for Christ offered only one sacrifice.\nHeb. 10:28.-“Without mercies”: i.e., without the least mercy.\nJam. 1:17.-“Father of lights”: i.e., true light. Hence, the Father who is\nthe source of all true light (being the genitive of origin).\n1Ре. 5:3.-“Not as being lords over God\'s heritages”: i.e., great\nheritage. The word “God” is repeated, by Ellipsis, from verse 2, and\npresents the same truth as Act. 20:28.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is a gloss and not a\ntranslation:-“Neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you.” The\ngreat point is that God’s People are His great inheritance; and that no\nman has a right to assume lordship or headship over it. It is Peter who\nsays this by the Holy Spirit. The Greek is τῶν κλήρων (ίφη kleerdbn),\nthe word from which we have the term “clergy.” So that man’s thought\nis just the opposite of God’s. Man’s thought is that the people are not\nto lord it over the clergy; but that the clergy are to lord it over them.\nThis is just the opposite of what is taught us and impressed upon us\nby the use of this figure in 1Pe. 5:3, where the truth is that the clergy\nare not to lord it over the laity.\n2Pe. 3:11.-“In holy conversations and godlinesses”: i.e., holy, weighty,\nand solemn conduct and piety.\n\nCertain words are generally plural: e.g., αἰῶνες (aiqones), ages.\nThis may be to mark the fact that eternity is made up of successive\nages: the singular referring either to one such age; or including all, as\na whole. Hence we have εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα (eis ton афпа), unto the age or\nfor ever (Mat. 21:19. Joh. 6:51; Joh. 6:58. 1Pe. 1:25 from Isa. 40:8,\netc.). And εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας (eis tous αἰφπας), unto the ages (Luk. 1:33.\nRom. 1:25; Rom. 9:5. Heb. 13:8, etc.).\n\nOUpavoi (ouranoi), heavens, is generally plural; a usage arising\nfrom the Hebrew idiom where the word is dual. It is always plural in\nthe phrase “kingdom of heaven,” where “heaven” is used by\nMetonymy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) for God. The Hebrew idiom is\nsometimes rendered thus, literally, and sometimes idiomatically,\n“kingdom of God.”\n\nSee under Idiom.\n\n3. Sometimes the plural is put for an indefinite number, or for one\nof many\n\nIn this latter case the word “one” is to be supplied by Ellipsis.\n\nGen. 8:4.-“The mountains”: i.e., one of the mountains, or the great\n\nmountain.\n\nGen. 19:29.-“The cities in which Lot dwelt”: {.6., in one of which cities.\n\nJdg. 12:7.-Here the words “one of’ are supplied in italics.\n\nNeh. 3:8.-“Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths”: i.e., of one\nof the goldsmiths.\nJob. 21:32.-“Yet shall he (the wicked) be brought to the graves”: i.e.,\nto one of the graves: i.e., his grave.\nMat. 2:20.-“They are dead who seek,” etc.: only Herod is meant (see\nExo. 4:19).\nMat. 9:8.-“Which gave such power to men (pl. [Note: The Plural\nNumber,] ).” Only one is meant, viz., Christ.\n\nTransition or Change from the Singular to the Plural.\n\nIn these cases, it is not so much that one number or person is\nexchanged for another as that there is a sudden change from one to\nthe other, calling our attention to the truth taught by this change. See\nunder Anacoluthon.\n\nExo. 10:2.-“And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son ... that ye\nmay know how that | am the Lord.”\n\nPsa. 14:1.-“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ They are\ncorrupt,” etc.\n\nIsa. 2:20.-“In that day shall a man cast his idols ... which they have\nmade each one for himself to worship.”\n\nGal. 4:6-8.-“Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of His\nSon into your hearts ... Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a\nson ... Howbeit, then, when ye knew not God,” etc.\nGal. 6:1.-“Ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of\nmeekness; considering thyself.”\nSee also 1Th. 5:1-10. 1Ti. 2:15. Rev. 1:3, etc.\nVil. Heterosis of Gender\nAs the Hebrew (like French) has no neuter gender, sometimes the\nmasculine is used, and sometimes the feminine.\n\nAnd this is seen in the Greek of the New Testament,\nnotwithstanding that the Greek has the neuter gender. There are,\nhowever, other exchanges of gender besides this.\n\n1. The Masculine for the Feminine\nAct. 9:37.-“Whom when they had washed.” Here, though (in the\nGreek) the masculine “they” is put, women are meant.\nHeb. 9:16-17.-“The testator,” 6 διαθέµενος (ho diatheminos): i.e., the\ncovenant-maker, is masculine; but the word for sacrifice, to which it\nrefers, is feminine: yet the masculine is used, because the sacrifice\nwas Christ Himself; otherwise it would have been feminine to agree\nwith sacrifice (ἡ θύσια, hee thusia). Thus, though the Greek word is\nfeminine, the Heb. éag is masculine, and © διαθέµινος agrees with\nthe Heb. thought, rather than with the Greek word. (See pages 69 and\n493).\n\n2. The Masculine for the Neuter\nGen. 2:18.-“He is not good”: i.e., it is not a good thing for him (man) to\nbe alone. See also Psa. 119:65. Isa. 5:20; Isa. 7:15.\nJoh. 16:13.-“When He-the Spirit of truth-is come, He will guide you\ninto all truth, for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He\nshall hear that shall He speak, and He will show you things to come.”\nHere, though the word “Spirit” is neuter, the pronouns are masculine,\nand this is so put in order to show and impress upon us that the Holy\nSpirit is a Person.\n3. The Feminine for the Neuter\n\nGen. 50:20.-“Ye thought evil (fem.) against me, but God meant it unto\ngood (fem.).” While the masc. mA is generally used for moral evil, its\nfeminine ma is used for the consequence of that-viz., physical evil.\nSo here, the feminine denotes mischief, hurt: “Ye meant me harm; but\nGod meant it (masc.) for good”: i.e., meant to turn it to good. So also\nJob. 5:9. Psa. 12:3; Psa. 27:4.\n\nAlso for the use of pronouns (see Gen. 15:6; Gen. 43:32. Exo.\n10:11. Num. 23:23. Psa. 118:23. Mat. 21:42. Mar. 12:11.\n4. The Neuter for the Masculine or Feminine\nMat. 1:20.-“For that (neut.) which is conceived (or begotten) in her.”\nSo Luk. 1:35 : “that holy thing.”\nMat. 18:11.-“For the Son of Man is come to save that (neut.) which\nwas lost”: i.e., lost sinners, of both sexes.\nJoh. 1:46 (47).-“Can there any good thing (neut.) come out of\nNazareth?” The words were spoken with reference to Christ.\nJoh. 3:6.-“That (neut.) which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that\n(neut.) which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” The neuter is used to agree\nwith the word “thing,” though person is meant: because that which is\nborn of the flesh or spirit is rather the fleshly or spiritual nature, than\nthe man as an individual: but also, because it includes men and\nwomen.\nHeb. 7:7.-“And without all contradiction the less (neut.) is blessed of\nthe better.”\n\nSee also Luk. 16:15. Joh. 6:39 (compare verse 40). 1Co. 1:27-28.\n1Jn. 1:1.-“That which was from the beginning,” etc.: ᾖΘ., Him who\nwas. Compare Joh. 1:1; Joh. 1:14.\n1Jn. 5:4.-“For whatsoever (neut.) is begotten of God.” That this refers\nto persons is clear from verses 1-5: but it is put neuter both on\naccount of the spiritual or new nature which is referred to (spirit being\nneuter), as well as from the fact that both men and women are\nincluded.\n\n1Jn. 5:8.-“There are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit (neut.),\nand the water (neut.), and the blood (neut.), and these (masc.) three\nare one.” Because persons are meant, the pronoun is masculine,\nthough the other words are neuter.',''),(108,108,'hypallage','Gen. 10:9.-“A strong man of hunting”: {.Θ., a mighty hunter, as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nHere, according to the ordinary usage, the word “hunting” would\nbe (by Enallage) the qualifying word: a hunting man of strength; but,\nby Hypallage, there is an Interchange, by which the noun becomes the\nadjective: a mighty hunter.\n\nGen. 29:14.-“And he abode with him a month of days”: {6., the days\nof a month; a calendar month. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “The space of a month.”\n\nLev. 12:4.-“The blood of her purifying” or “purgation”: i.e., in the\npurgation or cleansing from her blood.\n\nDeu. 12:3.-“The graven images of their gods”: i.e., their gods\nconsisting of graven images.\n\nJos. 2:6.-“She hid them with the flax of stalks”: i.e., with the stalks of\nflax (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] ), or flax-stalks.\n\n2Sa. 12:27.-“I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the city of\nwaters”: i.e., taken or cut off the waters of the city. 2Sa. 12:28 shows\nhe had not taken the city, for Joab says to David, come “lest | take the\ncity.”\nWhen, therefore, in verse 26, it is said he “took the royal city,” it\nmust mean the royal part of the city, where the king resided.\n1Ki. 17:14.-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The barrel of meal (i.e.,\nthe meal in the barrel) shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil\n(i.e., the oil in the cruse) fail.”\nNeh. 10:34.-“For the offering of wood”: i.e., the wood for the offering,\nunless it mean the free supply of wood.\nEst. 9:19.-“That dwelt in the cities of the villages”: i.e., in the villages\nbelonging to the cities.\nJob. 31:27.-“Or my hand hath kissed my mouth”: i.e. (as A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nrenders it), my mouth hath kissed my hand.\nPsa. 19:13 (14).-“Keep back also thy servant from presumptious sins”:\nie., keep back presumptuous sins from thy servant, “let them not,” etc.\nPsa. 139:23-24.-“Search me, O God (El) ... and see if there be any\nwicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting”: i.e., see if | be\nin any wicked way. The Heb. is “a way of grief:” where grief (the effect\nof a wicked way) is put (by Metonymy) for the wicked way which\ncauses it. See Metonymy.\nPro. 26:23.-“Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd\ncovered with silver of dross”: {6., dross of silver.\n\nJer. 11:19.-“I knew not that they had devised devices against me,\nsaying, Let us destroy his dish in his-food”: i.e., the food in his dish.\nEze. 21:29 (34).-“In the time of the iniquity of the end”: {6., in the time\nof the end of their iniquity; or, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “when their iniquity shall\nhave an end.”\n\nMat. 8:3.-“His leprosy was cleansed”: {6., he was cleansed from his\nleprosy. Or perhaps leprosy is put (by Metonymy of the adjunct) for the\nperson diseased with it. See under Metonymy.\n\nAct. 5:20.-“All the words of this life”: i.e., all these words of life.\n\nRom. 5:17.-“Abundance of grace”: i.e., abounding grace (not gracious\nabounding).\n\nRom. 7:24.-“Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” {6.,\nthis body of death (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] margin); or, this mortal, dying body.\nNot until this mortal body shall die, or be changed and glorified, shall\nthe saints be delivered from their conflict between the old and the new\nnatures. It cannot be accomplished by vows or resolutions, or by\ndiscipline, which is the fond idea and aim of all who are ignorant of this\nteaching, from Rome to Keswick.\n\nRom. 9:31.-“But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,\nhath not attained to the law of righteousness”: ᾖθ. to the\nrighteousness of the law.\n\nRom. 15:19.-“So that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,\n| have fully preached the gospel of Christ”: i.e., | have filled, with the\ngospel of Christ, Jerusalem and round about, etc.\n\n2Co. 3:7.-“If the ministration (or ministry) of death written and\nengraven in stones.” It was the /etters, not the ministry, which were\nengraven on stones.\n\nGal. 6:1.-“The spirit of meekness”: i.e., meekness of spirit.\n\nEph. 1:9.-“The mystery of His will.”\n\nThe word µυστήριον (musteerion) rendered mystery always means\na secret. And here it is the Secret pertaining to God’s purpose: i.e., the\nSecret which He hath purposed; or, by the figure Hypallage, His\nSecret purpose, because the noun in regimen is the word qualified\ninstead of the word which qualifies.\n\nIn Jdt. 2:2 we have the remarkable expression: Nebuchadnezzar\n“called together all his servants, and all his great men, and\ncommunicated with them his secret counsel”: i.e., the secret of his will.\nThe word µυστήριον is the same in each case, but in the case of\nNebuchadnezzar it was the secret of his βουλή (boulee): i.e., his will,\nbecause he had determined it: while in Eph. 1:9, it is the secret of\nGod’s θέληµα (theleema): i.e., His will, because He desired it. Hence\nthe meaning is “God’s secret purpose or counsel.”\n\nHeb. 9:15.-“That ... they which are called might receive the promise of\neternal inheritance”: i.e., the eternal inheritance which had been\npromised.\n\nHeb. 9:23.-Here, the purification attributed to the heavenly things\nreally applies to those who shall enter; as is clear from the former part\nof the verse.\n\nJam. 2:17.-“Faith ... is dead”: i.e., the man who says he has such faith\nis dead.\n\nJam. 3:4.-“Wherever the impulse of the steersman may will”: {6., as in\nA.V.

The Spirit for the gifts and operations of the Spirit\nJoh. 3:34.-“Рог God giveth not the Spirit by measure to Him”: i.e., the\ngifts and operations produced by the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a\nperson, and cannot, therefore, be measured out or given by measure.\nThe “measure” must consequently mean the measure of His power or\ngifts bestowed.\n\nJoh. 6:63.-“The words that | speak unto you, they, are spirit ({6., the\ngift and operation of the Spirit of God), and they are life (i.e., they give\nand produce divine, spiritual and eternal life).”\n\nAct. 19:2.-“Did ye on believing receive the Holy Ghost?” Here, this\nmust mean the wondrous gifts of the Spirit, because they had already\nreceived Him, or they could not have believed at all. Verse 6 also\nshows that this must be so, for the very gifts and powers are named\nand exercised.\n\n1Co. 14:12.-“Forasmuch as ye also are zealous of spirits”: ie., of\nspiritual powers and gifts and revelations.

Eph. 6:16.\nHeb. 11:34, where it is rendered “quench”; and Mat. 25:8, where it is\n“gone out, or going out” (marg.).] It is impossible for mortal man to\nextinguish the Holy Spirit of God: so that there must be a figure here.\nThat figure lies not in the word “quench,” but in the word “spirit,” which\nis put for the gifts of the Spirit. These are quenched, when any,\nassuming and usurping authority, forbid the use of them by a brother,\nor hinder him in the exercise of them.\nThis is clearly the subject of the exhortation; for the very next\nsentence goes on to speak of the manner in which it is to be obeyed:\n“Despise not prophesyings”: do not treat them with contempt or scorn;\ndo not neglect or disregard them. This is the meaning of ἐξουθενέω\n(exoutheneq) (see Luk. 23:11. Act. 4:11. Rom. 14:10, where it is\nrendered set at nought; and Luk. 18:9. Rom. 14:3. 1Co. 1:28; 1Co.\n16:11.

The Spirit is put for special and extraordinary operations of the\n\nSpirit acting externally in various ways, publicly or privately\nNum. 11:17.-“I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it\nupon them”: {6., not the Person of the Holy Spirit, but His operations,\nenabling Moses, and afterwards the seventy elders, to rule the\nPeople.\n\nThe history goes on to tell how Joshua would have had two of\nthem forbidden!

A person could not flow out from\nanother person.\n\nLuk. 1:17.-“And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of\nElijah”: i.e., the same wonderful spiritual power should be in John as\nwas in Elijah. See under Hendiadys.\n\nLuk. 1:80.-“And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit”: i.e., in the\nspecial and peculiar manifestations of the Spirit. So Luk. 2:40.\n\nAct. 1:5.-“Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost”: i.e., ye shall be\nimmersed in spiritual “power” (see verse 8), which shall cover you as\nwell as fill you and flow out from you.\n\nAct. 7:51.-“Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost”: i.e., the testimony of\nthe Holy Spirit as given by the prophets. Their fathers resisted the\nprophets, and would not hear the Spirit\'s voice in them and now they,\nlike their fathers, were resisting the same testimony as given at\nPentecost, and since then culminating in Stephen.\nThe Holy Ghost in His testimony is always resisted by the natural\nman: /е., opposed by him. He cannot, of course, be resisted in the\nsense of being successfully repelled. The Greek word here is\navtittittTw (antipiptd), to fall against, oppose. It occurs only here, but\nthe context clearly shows the nature and character of the opposition,\nthe reference to the “ears” indicating that they refused to listen to His\ntestimony. The natural ear is always closed against the Divine\ntestimony, until it is “opened” by One who is stronger than the strong\nman armed.\n2Co. 3:6.-“Who hath made us competent ministers also of the New\nCovenant: not of letter (/.e., the Divine Law of the Old Covenant), but\nof spirit (1.6., the ministration of the Spirit, verse 8: the New Covenant\nas contained in the Gospel).”\n\n4. The Spirit is put also for special revelations and visions\n\ncommunicated by Him\nEze. 37:1.-“The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in\nthe Spirit of the Lord”: i.e, in a vision.\n2 Theas. 2:2.-“That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,\nneither by spirit ({.6., by a revelation professed to have been received\nby the Spirit), nor by word (professed to be spoken by us), nor by\nletter as from us (said to be written by us), as that the Day of the Lord\nhas set in.” For the meaning of this last statement, see the next verse\nunder Ellipsis, pages 52 and 53.\n\n1Jn. 4:1-3.-“Beloved, believe not every spirit (i.e., every doctrine that\nis put forth as the teaching of the Spirit), but try the spirits ({:6., their\nteaching and doctrines, Act. 17:11), whether they are of God (or of\ndemons and evil spirits): because many false prophets are gone out\ninto the world. Hereby know ye the spirit (or doctrine and teaching) of\nGod. Every spirit ({6., doctrine) which confesseth (or teacheth) that\nJesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit (or\ndoctrine) that confesseth not (i.e., that does not teach) that Jesus\nChrist is come in the flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit (ie.,\nteaching) of Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come; and\neven now is it in the world.”\n\nAs Antichrist himself has not yet come, it must mean his teaching\nwhich is already here. The confusion of the small and capital letters (5\nand S) in this passage shows that the translators did not perceive the\nMetonymy here used.\n\nRev. 1:10.- was in spirit.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] uses a capital S,\nand not a small one as in chap. 4:2; 17:3, and Eze. 37:1, etc., but, the\nmeaning is the same. “I became in a spiritual vision or ecstasy; or, |\nreceived a spiritual revelation;” which was afterwards written down.\nSee also Act. 10:10; Act. 22:17, and 2Co. 12:2, where similar visions\nand revelations are called a “trance.” There is great divergence of the\nuse of small and capital letters in all different versions.\n\n5. Parents and Ancestors are frequently put for their posterity,\nand for children: and the name of the stock or race is put for the\npatronymic\n\nJaphet and Shem are put for their posterity (Gen. 9:27).\n\nJacob and Israel for the Israelitish people (Exo. 5:2. Num. 21:25;\nNum. 24:5; Num. 24:17. Deu. 33:28. 1Ki. 18:17-18. Psa. 14:7; Psa.\n135:4. Amo. 7:9).\n\nIsaac for the people of Israel (Amo. 7:9).\n\nEsau for the people descended from Esau (Rom. 9:13).\n\nDavid is put for him who is descended from David; and therefore\nespecially of the Messiah, who was of the seed of David according to\nthe flesh (Eze. 34:23). Compare Rom. 1:3; Rom. 9:5.\nAbraham is put for Christ by the same figure of Metonymy. “In thee\nshall all families of the earth be blessed”: i.e., in Christ (Gen. 12:3;\nGen. 18:18). So Isaac, 26:4; and Jacob, 28:14. This is explained in\nGal. 3:8; Gal. 3:14; Gal. 3:16. Gen. 22:18. Psa. 72:17. Act. 3:25-26.\n\n6. The Writer is put for his writing or book\nLuk. 16:29.-“They have Moses (i.e., his writings) and the prophets\n(i.e., their writings); let them hear them.”\nSee Luk. 24:27. Act. 15:21; Act. 21:21. 2Co. 3:15.\n7. To this first species of Metonymy must be referred the use of the\nword Soul for life, which is the effect of it\nIndeed, when so used, the Hebrew déu (nephesh) and the Greek\nψυχή (pseuchee) are often so translated.\n\nSee Gen. 9:5; Gen. 37:21. Exo. 4:19. Lev. 17:11. Jdg. 9:17. 1Sa.\n26:21. 1Ki. 2:23. Est. 8:11. Psa. 33:19; Psa. 38:12 (13); 56:13 (14).\nJer. 40:14; Jer. 45:5. Lam. 5:9. Jon. 2:6. Mat. 2:20; Mat. 10:39; Mat.\n16:25; Mat. 20:28. Joh. 10:17; Joh. 12:25; Joh. 13:37-38; Joh. 15:13,\netc.\n\n8. The Soul is also put for the person, as when we say a city contains\nso many thousand souls\nWe have examples in such phrases as “Praise the Lord, O my soul”\n(1Θ., О myself) (Psa. 103:1, etc.); or, “My soul doth (i.e., | myself do)\nmagnify the Lord” (Luk. 1:46); or, “Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e.,\nme) in Sheol” (Psa. 16:10. Act. 2:27; Act. 2:31. See Psa. 49:15.\nHebrews 16). Rev. 6:9 : “I saw the souls of them that were beheaded”:\nie., | saw them (i.e., the persons of them) that were slain.” Compare\n20:4.\n9. The Soul is also put for the will, affection, or desire, which are its\noperations and effects:-\nGen. 23:8. Exo. 23:9. Deu. 23:24. 1Ki. 19:3. Pro. 23:2. Jer. 34:16. Joh.\n10:24.\n10. The word spirit is sometimes so used for the soul or life in its\nmanifestations:-\nGen. 45:27. Num. 14:24. Jdg. 8:3. 2Ch. 21:16; 2Ch. 36:22. Ezr. 1:1.\nPsa. 76:12 (13); 77:3 (4), 6 (7). Pro. 1:23; Pro. 18:14; Pro. 29:11. Ecc.\n7:9. Isa. 29:10. Jer. 51:11. Eze. 13:3. Dan. 2:1; Dan. 2:3. Hag. 1:14.\nRom. 11:8. 1Co. 2:12.\nii. The ORGANIC CAUSE or instrument is put for the thing\neffected by it\n1. The Organs of Speech are put for the testimony borne\nThe Mouth is put for the witness or testimony borne by it.\nDeu. 17:6.-“At the mouth ({6., on the testimony) of two witnesses or\nthree shall he ... be put to death.” So Deu. 19:15, and Mat. 18:16.\nThe Mouth is put for the command or precept given.\n\nGen. 45:21.-“And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the mouth\n(1Θ., commandment, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) of Pharaoh.”\nExo. 17:1.-Israel journeyed “according to the mouth (i.e,\ncommandment, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] ) of Jehovah.” So Num. 3:16; Num.\n3:39; Num. 20:24; Num. 27:14. Deu. 1:26; Deu. 1:43.\nDeu. 34:5.-“So Moses ... died there according to the mouth ({6., the\nword) of Jehovah.”\n\nThe Targum of Jonathan takes this literally (or as\nAnthropopathpoeia, q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ), and interprets it as a\nkiss!\n\nThe Tongue is put for what is spoken by it.\nPsa. 5:9 (10).-“They flatter with their tongue”: i.e., with what it says.\nPro. 25:15.-“A soft tongue (i.e., gentle speech) breaketh the bone”\n(1Θ., overcomes obstinacy).\n\nPro. 10:20.-“The tongue (i.e., the words or speech) of the just is as\nchoice silver.”\n\nJer. 18:18.-“Let us smite him with the tongue”: i.e., with hard words.\nThe Tongue is also put for the language peculiar to any people or\nnation.\n\nAct. 2:4.-“They ... began to speak with other tongues”: i.e., in other\nlanguages). So verse 11. Mar. 16:17. 1Co. 14:18.\nThe Lip is put for the language.\n\nGen. 11:1.-“And the whole earth was of one lip ({6., language) and of\none speech.”\nPro. 12:19.-“The lip (/е., speech) of truth shall be established for\never.”\n\nVerse 22: “Lying lips (ie., liars or lies) are abomination to the\nLord.”\nPro. 14:8.-“The lips of knowledge”: i.e., the words of wisdom, or wise\nwords.\nPro. 17:7.-“Excellent lip (i.e., speech) becometh not a fool; much less\ndoes a lip of lying a prince”: i.e., lying words. So Pro. 18:6-7.\nIsa. 33:19.-“A people deeper of lip ({6., speech) than to be\nunderstood.”\n\nThe Palate is put for the words spoken.\nPro. 5:3.-“Her palate is smoother than oil”: i.e., her speech.\nThe Throat also is put for the words spoken.\n\nPsa. 5:9 (10).-“Their throat (i.e., their speech) is an open sepulchre.”\nSo Rom. 3:13, explained by Luk. 11:44.\n\n2. The Hand is put for the actions performed by it\nThese are many and various; as finding, counselling, thought,\npurpose, impulse, effort, attempt, or care. The “hand” is put by\nMetonymy for all these and similar things.\nDeu. 32:36.-“When he seeth that their hand was gone.” This is rightly\nrendered “power”; for which the “hand” is put by Metonymy.\n1Sa. 22:17.-Saul said, “Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord; because\ntheir hand ({6., help) is with David, and because they knew him when\nhe fled, and did not show it to me”: i.e., the priests helped David with\ntheir counsel, and with food; and by silence, in not betraying him. All\nthis is contained in, and expressed by, the word “hand.”\n2Sa. 3:12.-“My hand (i.e., my help) shall be with thee.”\n2Sa. 14:19.-“Is not the hand (i.e., the counsel) of Joab with thee in all\nthis?”\n1Ki. 10:29.-“And so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of\nSyria, did they bring them out by their hand” (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , by\ntheir means).\nPsa. 7:3 (4).-“O Jehovah my Elohim, if | have done this: if there be\niniquity in my hands”: {6., if | have done iniquity. So Isa. 1:15.\n\nThe Hand is also put for instrumentality or agency, especially in\n\nconnection with /nspiration.\n\nEzr. 9:10-11.-“Thy commandments which thou hast commanded by\nthe hand (i.e, the agency) of thy servants the prophets.”\n\nIn all these cases there is an implied reference to testimony\npreserved in writing.\nNeh. 9:30.-“Thou testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in (or by) the\nhand (i.e., the agency) of thy prophets.”\nZec. 7:12.-“The words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in (or by) His\nSpirit by the hand of the former prophets”: {6., by their agency.\n\nThis is the testimony of one of the latter prophets to the Inspiration\nof the “former”: viz., Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.\n\nThe Hand is also put for the writing done by it or hand-writing. As we\nsay of one “he writes a good hand.”\nSee 1Co. 16:21. Col. 4:18.\nThe Hand is also put for a gift given to anyone.\nPsa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God”:\nie., shall bring presents, as in Psa. 68:29, of which this is the\ncontinuation. As further explained in Psa. 72:10. Isa. 49:7; Isa. 60:6;\nIsa. 60:9. Psa. 22:27 (28).\n\n3. The Sword is put for war or for slaughter\nExo. 5:3.-“Lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with sword”: i.e.,\nwith slaughter.\nLev. 26:6.-“Neither shall the sword (i.e, war) go through your land.”\n\nSo Isa. 1:20. Jer. 14:12-13; Jer. 14:15-16; Jer. 43:11. Psa. 144:10.\n\nRom. 8:35, and many other, passages.\nMat. 10:34.-Ч came not to send peace, but a sword” (i.e., but for war).\nThat is to say, the object of His coming was peace, but the effect of it\nwas war.\n4. A Line is used for the territory divided up or marked out by it\nAmo. 7:17.-“Thy land shall be divided by line”: i.e., divided up among\nothers.\n\nMic. 2:5.-“Thou wilt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the\ncongregation of Jehovah.”\n\nThe land in Palestine round each village was divided by lot for the\nyear, for each family to sow and reap. Referring to this, David says,\n“The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places,” and then he goes on\nto explain it, “Yea, | have a goodly heritage” (Psa. 16:6).\n\nHence the word “line” is used of an inheritance measured out See\nDeu. 3:4 (where it is rendered “region”). Jos. 17:14. Psa. 105:11 (the\nlot of your inheritance).\n\nIn this sense Israel was (among the other nations) the line or lot of\nJehovah\'s inheritance. Deu. 32:8-9.\n20ο. 10:16.-“In another man’s line”: /е., in another man’s inheritance\nor sphere of labour.\n\nPsa. 19:4 (5).-“Their line is gone out through all the earth.” The A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] interprets the Metonymy incorrectly in the margin, “their rule or\ndirection.” \\t is their inheritance: i.e., the whole earth was the sphere\nthrough which their words and speech went forth, and where the\nknowledge imparted by the stars was made known. See Rom. 10:18.*\n[Note: And The Witness of the Stars, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\n5. Silver is put for the thing procured by it\nExo. 21:21.-Where a servant is said to be the money of the master.\n\n6. Hyssop is put for the sprinkling which was effected by it\nHyssop ({ό/6) a small humble moss-like shrub (1Ki. 4:33; ΚΙ. 5:13)\nused in ceremonial sprinklings. See Lev. 14:4. Num. 19:18, etc.\n\nPsa. 51:7 (9).-“Purge me with hyssop, and | shall be clean”: {6., purge\nme with the atoning blood; not with the herb.\niii. The THING or ACTION is put for that which is the effect or\nproduct of it\nSome Rhetorists confine Metonymy only to nouns, and deny its\napplication to verbs. But there seem to be certain words, even verbs,\nthe use of which cannot otherwise be classed except under the figure\nMetonymy: words which, if not actually changed for or strictly used\ninstead of others, are yet analagous, and have the meaning of another\nword taken conventionally with them; so that a thing or action is put for\nsome effect which is understood as being consequent upon it.\n\n1. In certain NOUNS, where the Feeling or Affection is put for the\n\neffects resulting or proceeding from the feeling\nLove is put for the benefits and blessings flowing from it.\n1Jn. 3:1.-“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed\nupon us”: i.e., not merely the feeling of love, but the manifestation of it\nin all that it has done for us: one thing here being the calling and\nmaking lost sinners the sons of God, and blessing them with all\nspiritual blessings in Christ.\nMercy is put for the offices and benefits which are the outcome of it.\n\nGen. 20:13.-\"This is thy kindness which thou shalt show, etc.”\nGen. 32:10.-“I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all\nthe truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant”: i.e., all the\nmaterial and spiritual benefits bestowed in kindness and faithfulness.\n2Ch. 35:26.-“Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness”\n(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] Heb. kindnesses): i.e., his acts of\nkindness.\n\nBy the same figure the Greek ἑλεημοσύνη (pity, or mercy) is put for\nbenefits bestowed upon the poor.\nMat. 6:1.-“Take heed that ye do not your alms.” The R.V. [Note: The\n\nRevised Version, 1881.] and Critical Texts (G. [Note: . Griesbach and\n\nhis critical Greek Text.] L. [Note: . Lachmann and his critical Greek\n\nText.] T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his critical Greek Text.] Tr. [Note: r.\n\nTregelles and his critical Greek Text.] A. [Note: . Alford and his critical\n\nGreek Text.] ) have δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee), righteousness, instead\n\nof ἐλεημοσύνη (elesmosunee), mercy. The reading doubtless arose\n\nfrom some scribe’s not seeing the Metonymy, and trying to explain it.\nIn either case the feeling is put for the acts which manifest it. So\n\nLuk. 11:41. Act. 10:2; Act. 10:4.\n\nAnger and Wrath are put for punishment, and various acts which flow\n\nfrom them.\n\nPsa. 79:6.-“Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known\n\nthee”: i.e., thy judgments. So 1Sa. 28:18.\n\nMic. 7:9.-“I will bear the indignation of Jehovah”: ie., the\n\nchastisements which it inflicts.\n\nRom. 2:5.-Thou “treasurest up unto thyself wrath”: i.e., the judgments\n\nproduced by it.\nRom. 4:15.-“The law worketh wrath”: ie., inflicts or executes\npunishments and penalties. The word “execute” is actually supplied in\nRom. 13:4.\n\nRom. 13:5.-“Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath”:\ni.e., on account of the effects of the anger, etc., of those who govern,\n“but also for conscience sake”: {6., because ye believe it to be right\naccording to the will of God.\n\nEph. 5:6.-“For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon\nthe children of disobedience”: {6., the punishments inflicted by God on\naccount of His wrath.\n\nJustice is put for the judgment or punishment which manifests it.\nExo. 6:6.-“I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm and with great\njustice”: {6., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] , judgments. As rendered in Pro. 19:29.\nEze. 14:21, etc.\n\nIt is put also for the actual sentence and condemnation.\n\nJer. 26:11.-“The judgment (/.e., the sentence) of death is for this man.”\nThis Metonymy is idiomatically rendered in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So Joh. 3:19\n(κρίσις, krisis, the act or process of judging).\n\nSin and its synonyms are put for the effects or punishment of sin.\nGen. 19:15.-“Lest thou be condemned in the iniquity’: ie.,\npunishment, as in margin of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So Psa. 7:16 (17).\n\nJer. 14:16.- will pour their wickedness upon them”: ie., the\npunishment on account of their wickedness.\nZec. 14:19.-“This shall be the sin (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) of\nEgypt”: i.e., the punishment for Egypt\'s sin.\n\nWhen joined with the verb to bear (i.e., to bear iniquity), it means\nto bear the punishment or judgment for iniquity, etc. See Exo. 28:43.\nLev. 5:1; Lev. 20:20; Lev. 22:9. Num. 14:33. Isa. 53:4. Eze. 23:35;\nEze. 23:49; Eze. 18:20.\n\nWhen Christ is said to bear our sins, it means that He bore\nthepunishment (i.e., death) which was due to them. Heb. 9:28. 1Pe.\n2:24, etc.\nWork is put for the wages paid for it.\n\nLev. 19:13.-Heb. work; A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] , wages.\nJer. 22:13.-“And doth not give him his work”: i.e., Heb. his wage. A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] : “for his work.”\nRom. 11:6.-“If by grace, then is it no more of works”: i.e., of wages or\nmerit.\nRev. 14:13.-“And their works (i.e., their rewards) do follow with them.”\n\nDivination is put for the money received for it.\nNum. 22:7.-“So the elders departed with divinations in their hands.”\nHere, both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] do\nnot scruple to boldly translate the Metonymy and put “the rewards of\ndivination.”\nLabour is put for that which is produced by it.\n\nDeu. 28:33.-“All thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat\nup”: {9., all the fruit of thy labours.\nPsa. 78:46.-“He gave ... their labour unto the locust”: {6., the fruit of\ntheir labour.\nPsa. 105:44.-“They inherited the labour of the people.”\nPsa. 128:2.-“Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands”: i.e., that which\nthe labour of thy hands has produced.\nPro. 5:10.-“Lest ... thy labours be in the house of a stranger”: i.e., that\nwhich thou hast made or produced.\n\nSo Ecc. 2:19. Isa. 45:14. Jer. 3:24. Eze. 23:29.\nStrength is put for that which it effects or produces.\nGen. 4:12.-“When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield\nunto thee her strength”: i.e., her fruits shall not be brought forth freely\nand liberally to thee.\nPro. 5:10.-“Lest strangers be filled with thy strength”: i.e., that which\nthy strength brings forth. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : wealth.\nHunting is put for the flesh of the animal that is caught.\nGen. 25:28.-“And Isaac loved Esau because hunting was in his\nmouth.” Here, the mouth is put for the eating which it performed, and\nhunting for the venison which it caught. See also under Ellipsis, page\n26.\nGen. 27:3.-‘Hunt me a hunting”: i.e., catch or take for me some\nvenison (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] ). See Polyptoton, page 275.\n2. In certain VERBS\nThe same Metonymy is seen in certain verbs, but it is confined to\nverbs of (a) Knowing, (b) Remembering, (c) Loving and Hating, and\n(d) Operation.\n(a) Verbs of Knowing\nare used of the effect of knowing: i.e., understanding, caring for,\napproving, etc.\nJob. 19:25.-“I know that my redeemer liveth”: {6., | believe, or have a\nsaving knowledge of the fact.\nPsa. 1:6.-“The Lord knoweth ({6., approveth) the way of the\nrighteous.” So Rev. 2:24.\nPsa. 9:10 (11).-“They that know thy name will put their trust in thee”:\ni.e., they that understand Thee as their God and Saviour.\nPsa. 35:11.-‘False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things\nthat | knew not”: i.e., things which | was not conscious of, or did not\nacknowledge as true. So Psa. 51:3 (5). 2Co. 5:21.\nPsa. 90:11.-“Who knoweth ({6., Who rightly considers) the power of\nthine anger?” Many may hear of it and know of it in the ordinary sense\nof the verb, but who rightly estimates it and understands it?\nPro. 24:23.-“It is not good to know (or discern) faces in (giving) the\njudgment”: i.e., to have respect or show favour to them. See Deu. 1:17\n(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) and 16:19. Job. 34:19.\n\nIsa. 1:3.-“Israel doth not know.” The next parallel line goes on to\nexplain it:-“My people doth not consider.” So Jer. 8:7. Luk. 19:42 (cf.\n[Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] Psa. 101:4). This comes also\nunder the figure Exergasia (q.v. [Note: Which see] )\n\nJer. 9:24.-“Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth\nand knoweth me”: /.е., loves me and believes me. Compare verses 3\nand 6.\n\nJer. 31:34.-“They shall all know me”: {6., believe in me with a saving\nfaith.\n\nJoh. 8:43.-“Ye cannot hear (i.e., receive, and understand, and\napprove) my word.” See verse 44.\nJoh. 10:27.-“My sheep hear my voice, and | know them”: {6., | love\nthem with all a shepherd’s fondness.\nJoh. 17:3.-‘This is life eternal that they might know (i.e., believe on)\nthee-the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”\nAct. 10:34.-\"I perceive (i.e., | now understand and am made to know\nfrom what has taken place) that God is no respecter of persons.”\nRom. 7:15.-“For that which | do | know not.” Here, the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\ntranslates the Metonymy, “that which | do | allow not”: i.e., | do not\napprove. The old Eng. of the verb allow is allaud, to praise or approve,\nas in Psa. 11:5. Prayer Book (i.e., Coverdale’s) Version: “The Lord\nalloweth the righteous”: i.e., approveth him.\n1Со. 8:3.-“If any man love God, the same is known of him”: {8., is\nloved and cared for by Him (see Heterosis of the verb).\n\nVerbs of Knowing are sometimes put for caring for or manifesting\n\naffection to.\n\nGen. 39:6.-“He (Potiphar) knew not ought he had”: i.e., had no anxiety\nabout it.\nExo. 2:25.-“And God knew them”: i.e, as in AV. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , had\nrespect unto them.\nDeu. 33:9.-“Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew ({6.,\ncared for) his own children.”\n\nSo Rth. 2:10; Rth. 2:19.\nJdg. 2:10.-“There arose another generation after them, which knew\nnot the Lord”: {.6., which did not care for Him.\n1Ch. 17:18.-“Thou knowest (i.e., hast respect to) thy servant.”\nPsa. 37:18.-“The Lord knoweth the days of the upright”: ᾖθ., has\nrespect to them and acts accordingly.\nPsa. 142:4 (5).-“There was no man that would know me”: i.e., that\nwould care for me. See under Ellipsis.\nPro. 12:10.-“A righteous man knoweth the life of his beast”: i.e., he\nregardeth and careth for it.\nPro. 29:7.-“The righteous knoweth (A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , considereth) the\ncause of the poor.”\nJer. 1:5.-“Before | formed thee in the belly | knew thee”: i.e., cared for\n\nand loved thee.\n\nJer. 24:5.-“So shall | know (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\n\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , acknowledge) them that are\n\ncarried away captive.”\n\nAmo. 3:2.-“You only have | known of all the families of the earth”: i.e.,\n\nloved and cared for. Cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] Deu.\n\n4:20.\n\n1Th. 5:12.-“We beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour\n\namong you”: i.e., to consider and care for them.\n\n2Ti. 2:19.-“The Lord knoweth (i.e., loves and cares for) them that are\n\nhis.” See also under Heterosis.\n\nVerbs of Knowing are used also of experiencing, either by saving faith\nor by personal dealing.\n\nIsa. 53:11.-“By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify\n\nmany”: i.e., knowledge of Him and the salvation which He gives. See\n\nLuk. 1:77. “To give knowledge of salvation.”\n\nMat. 7:11.-“If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto\nyour children,” etc.: i.e., are able, notwithstanding all your innate\nblindness, to understand enough, in spite of your selfishness, to give\ngood gifts, etc.\n\nMar. 5:29.-“And she knew (ἔγνω) by her body (i.e., by the sensations\nof it) that she was healed of that plague”: i.e. (as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), “she\nfelt.” She experienced, just as the Lord Himself did in verse 30, where\nwe have the same verb used of Him: “knowing in Himself” (ἐπιγνούς).\n1Co. 4:19.-“But | will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know\n(i.e., will find out and expose) not the speech of them which are puffed\nup, but the power.”\n20ο. 1:9.-“We had the sentence of death in ourselves”: ᾖθ., we\nexperienced the feelings of those who have had the sentence of death\npronounced upon them.\n(b) Verbs of Remembering\nare used of a strong desire or wish for the thing mentioned or\nremembered.\nIsa. 44:21.-“Remember these, O Jacob and Israel ... thou shalt not be\nforgotten of me”: i.e., desire the things which make for your peace,\netc.\nEze. 23:19.-“Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to\nremembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the\nharlot in the land of Egypt”: i.e., in desiring again the former sins.\nJon. 2:7 (8).-“When my soul fainted within me, | remembered the\nLord” (and therefore desired Him, and called upon Him).\n2Ti. 2:8.-“Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was\nraised from the dead according to my Gospel”: i.e., Believe and enjoy,\nand rest in, the blessed knowledge of the fact.\n\nHeb. 11:15.-“If they had been mindful of that country from whence\nthey came out”: i.e., if they had longed for it, or desired to return to it,\nthey could have done so. This is clear from the verb to “desire” in\nverse 16.\n\nSo the noun is used of the Lord’s Supper, “in remembrance of Me”:\nie., not a mere calling to mind, but that which is produced by such\nremembrance: viz., faith, love, hope, which are all bound up in that\nacknowledgment of Christ\'s death (Luk. 22:19. 1Со. 11:24-25).\nHitherto they had celebrated their deliverance from Egypt. Henceforth\nthey were to remember Christ, and the exodus which He\naccomplished, and to desire His return, looking for it with loving hope.\n\nOn the other hand, the verb to forget is used of unfaithfulness, and\nrejection.\nHos. 4:6.-“Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, | will also\nforget thy children”: i.e., seeing thou hast been unfaithful to me, and\nwill reject thy children.\n(c) Verbs of Loving and Hating\nare put for the actions consequent upon them.\n\nTo Love is put for to expect, or desire, or take.\nPsa. 11:5.-“Him that loveth violence (i.e., and hence practises it) his\nsoul hateth.”\nPro. 21:17.-“He that loveth (and therefore liveth in) pleasure shall be a\npoor man,” etc. He would not be poor unless he gratified his love of\npleasure by spending his substance.\nMat. 6:5.-“They love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the\ncorners of the streets,” and they do it because they love it.\nLuk. 11:43.-“Ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues”: i.e., ye\nnot only love them, but take them because ye love them.\nJoh. 3:19.-“Men loved darkness rather than light”: (and practised, and\nlived, and acted, accordingly).\n2Ti. 4:8.-“All them also that love His appearing” (and act, and live,\naccordingly).\n2Ti. 4:10.-“Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world”:\n(and returned to it).\n\nTo Love is used of the exercise of the greatest possible care for\nwhatever is the object of the love. While {ο hate is used in the opposite\nsense, of exercising less care, or of neglect.\nGen. 29:31.-“And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated”: i.e.,\nneglected, and the other more esteemed. See verse 30.\nBy some this is called Hyperbole (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ).\nJoh. 12:25.-“He that loveth his life shall lose it”: {6., that cares more\nfor his life than for Christ. See under Ellipsis and Hyperbole.\nThis is the explanation of Mat. 16:25, where it reads, “whosoever\nshall save his life”: i.e., shall care more for it, and preserve it, instead\nof giving it up for Christ. Compare Luk. 14:26.\n\nTo Love is used not merely for the act itself, but for the effect of it.\nPsa. 109:17.-“As he loved cursing”: i.e., not merely loved to do it, but\ndid it.\n\nPro. 13:24.-“He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth\nhim chasteneth him betimes”: i.e., his love takes effect, and is seen, in\nthe chastening.\nPro. 18:19.-“He loveth trangression that loveth strife’: ie, he\ntrangresses who strives, for He does it because he loves to do it.\nPro. 8:36.-“All they that hate me love death”: i.e., so live and act as to\ninjure life and accelerate death.\n(d) Verbs of Operation\nThe verb to do often denotes the effect rather than the act.\nGen. 12:5.-“The souls that they had gotten (Heb., made) in Haran”:\nie., the servants which they had acquired in Haran. Thus the\nMetonymy is here translated by the word “gotten.”\n\nGen. 30:30.-“And now when shall | do for my house also?” The A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] translates the Metonymy by the verb “provide”: “when shall |\nprovide?” etc.\n\nMat. 25:16.-“He that had received the five talents went and traded\nwith the same and made them (i.e., gained) other five talents,” as\nexplained in verse 20.\n\nCertain Verbs have not their own proper signification, but are used of\n\nthe actions or effects consequent upon them:\nTo Judge is put for punish or condemn.\n\nGen. 15:14.-“That nation whom they serve shall | judge”: i.e., punish\nwith judgments, not simply rule. Act. 7:7.\n\n2Ch. 20:12.-“O our God, wilt thou not judge them?” i.e., punish them.\nPsa. 9:19 (20).-“Let the heathen be judged in thy sight.”\nHeb. 13:4.-“Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge”: i.e.,\npunish. See also Joh. 3:18 and Rom. 14:3.\nTo Judge is also used in the sense of acquit, which is also an effect of\njudging. See\nPsa. 35:24.-“Judge me, О Lord my God”: {6., acquit me.\nTo Hurt or even to Injure is put for the Aurt or injury done.\n\nLuk. 10:19.-“Nothing shall by any means hurt you”: {Θ., have any\ninjurious effect upon you.\nRom. 8:31.-“If God be for us, who can be against as?” i.e., who can\nhurt us or bring any evils upon us? They can, of course, be “against\nus,” but not have any hurtful effect.\n\niv. The MATERIAL is put for the thing made of or from it\n\n1. Trees are put for arms or instruments made from them\nNah. 2:3 (4).-“The fir-trees shall be terribly shaken.” The context\nshows that “trees” are put for the spears, etc., which men make from\nthem.\n2Sa. 6:5.-“And David and all the house of Israel played before the\nLord on all fir-woods.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] both treat this as though it were an Ellipsis: “on all\nmanner of instruments made of firwood,” instead of seeing the\nMetonymy and saying simply, “On all manner of instruments,” which\nare immediately mentioned: viz., harps and psalteries. But according\nto a note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint reads with all\nmight and with songs instead of “on all manner of fir-woods.” Compare\nverse 14 and 1Ch. 13:8.\n\n2. Brass is put for fetters, etc\nLam. 3:7.-“He hath made my brass heavy”: i.e., my fetters, or bonds,\nor chains.\nJdg. 16:21.-“And bound him with two brasses”: /е., two brazen\nfetters.\n2Sa. 3:34.-“Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into brasses”:\nie., fetters, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.]\n3. Curtains are put for tents\n2Sa. 7:2.-“The ark of God dwelleth within curtains”: i.e., in the curtain\nor tent.\nJer. 4:20.-“Suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtain ({Θ., my\ntabernacle or dwelling) in a moment.”\nHab. 3:7.-“And the curtains (i.e., tents) of Midian’s land did tremble.”\n4. Corn is put for bread or food generally\nLam. 2:12.-“They say to their mothers, Where is corn (i.e., bread) and\nwine?”\n5. Gold and Silver and other metals and similar substances are put for\nwhat is made with them\nGen. 23:9.-“That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he\nhath, which is in the end of his field, for silver (i.e., money made from\nsilver) full (i.e., of full value) he shall give it to me in your midst (i.e.,\nwithin your boundaries), for a possession of (i.e., hereditary)\nsepulchre.”\n\nGen. 24:22.-“Of ten gold was their weight”: i.e., bracelets made of\ngold, ten shekels in weight.\n\n2Ki. 5:5.-“Six thousand of gold”: i.e., pieces of money.\n\n2Ki. 12:4 (5), where it is rendered “money.”\n\n1Ch. 21:22; 1Ch. 21:24.-“Full silver’: for full money value. In A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] rendered “full price.”\n\n1Ch. 29:2.-Here, the figure is translated by the words “things of’ in\nitalics. “| have prepared ... the gold for gold (things), and the silver for\nsilver (things), and the brass for brass (things),” etc.\n\nPsa. 115:4.-“Their idols are silver and gold”: i.e., made of silver and\ngold.\n\nMat. 10:9.-“Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass ({6., money\nmade from these) in your purses.”\n\nAct. 3:6.-“Silver and gold (i.e., money, like the Scottish “siller’ and\nFrench /’argent) have | none.”\n6. Iron is put for things made of it\n\n2Ki. 6:5.-“As one was felling a beam the iron (i.e., the axhead, as the\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] renders it) fell into the water.”\nPsa. 105:18.-“Whose foot they hurt with the gyve, his soul came into\niron”: i.e., he was fast bound with iron chains.\n\n7. Stones are put for things made of them\nExo. 7:19.-“Both in woods and in stones”: {6., both in wooden vessels\nand stone vessels.\nDeu. 25:13.-“Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers stones”: i.e.,\nweights. Heb., a stone and a stone.\nPro. 11:1.-“A perfect stone (i.e., a just weight) is his delight.”\nIsa. 34:11.-“The stones of emptiness’: i.e., the stones which\ncharacterize waste land.\nJer. 2:27.-“Saying ... to a stone (i.e., to an idol), Thou hast brought me\nforth” Jer. 3:9.\nZec. 4:10.-“They shall see the stone of tin (i.e, the plummet) in\nZerubbabel’s hand.”\n\n8. Wood is put for things made of wood\nSee above Exo. 7:19 (for vessels). Isa. 44:19. Jer. 2:27; Jer. 3:9; Jer.\n10:8. Hos. 4:12 (for idols).\nEze. 37:16.-“Take thee one wood and write upon it, ‘For Judah and for\nthe children of Israel his companions’: then take another wood, and\nwrite upon it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house\nof Israel his companions’ ”: i.e., take a tablet or stick made out of\nwood.\nGen. 40:19.-“Shall hang thee on a tree”: {6., a gallows. So Jos. 8:29.\nDeu. 21:22-23. Est. 7:9-10. Gal. 3:13. 1Pe. 2:24.\n2Sa. 21:19.-“The wood ({6., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “staff’) of whose spear\nwas like a weaver’s beam.”\nAct. 16:24.-“And made their feet fast in the wood”: i.e “in the stocks,”\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.]\n9. Flax is put for the wick made of it\n\nIsa. 42:3.-“The smoking flax (i.e., wicks) shall he not quench.” See\nunder Tapeinosis.\nIsa. 43:17.-“They are quenched as the flax”: /е., as a wick. (A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n161411, tow).\n\n10. Dust and Ashes for man, who is made of dust\nGen. 3:19.-“Dust thou art”: {6., made of dust.\nGen. 18:27.-“Dust and ashes.” See under Paronomasia.\nPsa. 103:14.-“He remembereth that we are dust”: {6., made of dust.\nEcc. 12:7.-‘Then shall the dust ({6., man) return to the earth as it\nwas.”\n11. Seed is put for son or posterity\n\nGen. 4:25.-“God ... hath appointed me another seed”: i.e., son.\n\nGen. 15:13.-“Thy seed shall be a stranger,” etc. So Act. 7:6; where the\nperiod of sojourning is stated to be 400 years. Whereas, in Exo. 12:40,\nand Gal. 3:17, where the period refers not to the sojourning of\nAbraham\'s seed (which could not commence till Isaac was born, thirty\nyears after the promise), but includes that of Abraham himself, the\nsum is given as 430 years.\n\n12. Forest or wood is put for the houses, etc., made of its trees\nJer. 21:14; Jer. 22:7 : compare these with Jer. 52:13. 2Ki. 25:9 and\n2Ch. 36:19, and the figures in the last two passages will be explained.\n\nIl. Metonymy of the Effect\nThis is when the effect is put for the cause producing it. It is of four\nkinds: (i.) The action for the actor. (ii.) The thing for the organic cause\nof it. (iii.) The effect for the producer of it. (iv.) The matter made for the\nmaterial cause of it. We will consider these in their order:-\ni. The ACTION or the EFFECT for the person producing the effect,\nor for the author of it\n\n1. Nouns\nGen. 25:23.-“Two nations are in thy womb”: i.e., two infants whose\nprogeny should become two different nations.\nGen. 26:35.-“Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah”:\nie., the source of much sorrow to them.\nGen. 49:18.-“I have waited for thy salvation (i.e., for Him who shall\nbring and work salvation), O Lord.”\nNeh. 12:31; Neh. 12:38; Neh. 12:40.-“Two great celebrations.” The\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have\nsupplied the words implied by the Metonymy (the former in italics, the\nlatter in roman type), by rendering “two great companies of them that\ngave thanks.” The effect of the praises or thanks, is put for the people\nwho rendered them.\nPsa. 18:1 (2).-“I will love thee, О Jehovah my strength”: i.e., the\nauthor and source of my strength. So Psa. 22:19 (20). Jer. 16:19.\nPsa. 27:1.-“The Lord is my light and my salvation.” This is not a\nMetaphor but a Metonymy: i.e., Jehovah is the source of my light, and\nthe author of my salvation. Compare Heb. 5:9.\n\nPsa. 106:20.-“Thus they changed their glory (i.e., God) into the\nsimilitude of an ox that eateth grass.”\n\nThe Massorah records this as one of the passages in which the\nSopherim changed the pronoun “my” into “their.” It was thought to be\ntoo gross an anthropomorphism to say “my,” Jehovah being the\nspeaker. See Appendix E.\n\nIsa. 49:6.-“That thou mayest be my salvation (i.e., the Saviour whom |\nhave sent) unto the end of the earth.”\n\nJer. 23:6.-“Jehovah our Righteousness”: ᾖθ., the Author of our\nrighteousness: our Justifier.\n\nMar. 9:17; Mar. 9:25.-“A dumb spirit”: i.e., a spirit which produced the\neffect of dumbness in the person possessed.\nLuk. 11:14.-“And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb”: i.e., it\nproduced dumbness in the man possessed. Compare Mat. 9:32-33.\nMar. 9:17; Mar. 9:25.\n\nLuk. 2:30.-“Mine eyes have seen thy salvation”: i.e., Christ the\nSaviour: the Worker and Author of Salvation. Luk. 3:6 and Isa. 49:6.\nLuk. 13:11.-“And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of\ninfirmity.” The negative uf (mee) implies that she felt unable to\nstraighten herself up,* [Note: The Greek of this is jie <6 otic 7 (eis\nto panteles), which occurs only here and Heb. 7:25. Here, to her full\nheight; there, to their full need.] and indicates some nervous disorder.\nSo the Lord uses the remarkable language about Satan as binding\nher.\n\nThis is not Enallage, “an infirm spirit,” but it is Metonymy, by which\nthe effect is put for the cause. The woman was troubled by a spirit\nwhich caused or produced this infirmity.\n\nJoh. 11:25.-“l am the resurrection and the life”: i.e., the Worker of\nresurrection, and the Giver of resurrection life.\n\nRom. 13:3.-“Rulers are not a terror”: {.6., a source of terror.\n\n2Со. 1:14.-“We are your rejoicing (i.e., cause of rejoicing), even as ye\nalso are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.” So 1Th. 2:19-20.\nRev. 1:12.-“And | turned to see the voice (/е., Him) that spake with\nme.” So Joh. 1:23.\n\n2. Verbs\nGen. 42:38.-“Shall ye bring down,” etc.: {6., shall be the cause of my\ndeath. See under Periphrasis.\nGen. 43:6.-“Why have ye done evil to me, to disclose to the man that\nye had yet another brother?” {6., why have you brought or caused all\nthis evil to be brought upon me.\nExo. 23:8.-“The gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the\nrighteous”: i.e., is an occasion by which these effects are produced.\n1Ki. 18:9.-“What have | sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant\n(i.e., cause to be delivered) into the hand of Ahab to slay me?”\nPsa. 76:10 (11).-“Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee”: i.e., shall\nbe the occasion of praise to thee.\nIsa. 43:24.-“Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins”: i.e., thy sins\nhave caused the hard service and Passion which | endured on\naccount of them.\nJer. 38:23.-“Thou shalt burn this city with fire”: i.e., thou shalt cause it\nto be burnt. See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] margin.\nEze. 19:7.-“He laid waste their cities”: i.e., their sins caused them to\nbe destroyed.\nAct. 1:18.-“Now this man purchased (i.e., caused to be purchased) a\nfield.”\nRom. 14:15.-“Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died”:\nie., do not be a cause of destruction.\n1Co. 7:16.-“For what knowest thou, О wife, whether thou shalt save\n(i.e., be the means of salvation or the occasion of much blessing to)\nthy husband?” etc. See 1Pe. 3:1.\nii. The THING EFFECTED by an instrument for the instrument or\norganic cause of it\n\nGen. 49:6.-Lit., “My soul (i.e., myself, I) will not come into their secret\n(counsel), mine honour shall not be with them in their assembly.”\n\nHere, “honour” is put for the tongue which gives it; and it means\nthat he would not honour them by speaking or taking part in their\nassembly. Compare Psa. 57:8; Psa. 108:1.\n\nDeu. 24:6.-“No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to\npledge: for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.” Here “life,” the effect, is\nput for the means of livelihood by which the life is preserved.\n\nPsa. 7:5 (6).-“Let him ... lay mine honour in the dust”: /.e., myself who\ngives honour.\n\nPsa. 16:9.-“Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth”: {6.,\nmy tongue gives glory, as is explained in Act. 2:26.\nPsa. 30:12 (13).-“To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and\nnot be silent.”\n\nHere, the word “glory” may be put for the tongue which gives it: but\nthe structure of the Psalm suggests another explanation of the\nMetonymy. This verse corresponds, in the structure, with verse 4:\n“Sing to Jehovah, O ye saints of His.” Compare 2Co. 8:23.\n\nSo that verse 12 would be “To the end that Thy saints may sing\npraise to Thee”: “glory” being put for the saints who give the glory.\nPsa. 57:8 (9).-“Awake up, my glory”: i.e., my tongue, wake up and\nglorify God.\n\nPro. 27:27.-“And thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for\nthe food of thy household, and for the life (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )\nof thy maidens”: i.e., as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it, “for the\nmaintenance of thy maidens.”\n\nMar. 12:44.-“She of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her\nliving (or life)”: i.e., all her means of supporting herself in life.\n\nLuk. 15:12.-“And he divided unto them his living (or life)’: /е., his\nmeans or property, by which life is sustained. So Mar. 12:44.\nAct. 17:31.-Lit., “Whereof he hath given faith to all men.” Here faith,\nthe effect, is put for the proofs or evidence on which it rests. “Whereof\nHe hath afforded evidence unto all men”: and then the evidence or\nproof is stated, “in that he hath raised him from the dead.” The A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] well render it\n“hath given assurance.”\n\nThe Resurrection of Christ is the evidence God affords of His\npurpose to judge the world by Him.\nRom. 1:16.-“For it [the gospel] is the power of God unto salvation to\nevery one that believeth”: i.e., the belief is the effect of the power of\nGod through the preaching of the gospel.\n1Jn. 5:4.-“This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our\nfaith.” “Victory,” the effect, is put for “our faith,” which accomplishes it.\nFrom Eph. 6:16 we learn that it is through Christ; who is the shield\nwhich faith uses.\n\niii. The EFFECT for the thing or action causing or producing it\n(a) In Nouns\nExo. 10:17.-“Intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from\nme this death only”: i.e., this plague which is causing death.\nDeu. 30:15.-“I have set before thee this day life and good, and death\nand evil”: {6., good things which end in life, and evil things which end\nin death. So in Deu. 32:47, and Jer. 21:8, etc.\n2Ki. 4:40.-“There is death in the pot”: i.e., there is that which produces\ndeath as the effect of eating it. How forcible is this Metonymy, by the\nuse of which time is saved, and perhaps life too.\nPro. 10:2.-“Righteousness delivereth from death”: {6., from the things\nthat end in death.\nPro. 19:13.-“A foolish son is the calamity of his father”: i.e., does that\nwhich brings or produces calamity.\nPro. 20:1.-“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.”\n\nHere, wine, etc., is put for its effects. It brings him who drinks to\nexcess into derision, and causes tumults.\nEcc. 11:1.-“Cast thy bread (i.e., the seed which produces it) upon the\nwaters.”\nIsa. 28:12.-‘This is the rest”: i.e., this is what gives rest.\nJer. 3:24.-“For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers”: i.e.,\nthe worship of Baal, which brought upon them shame and sorrow.\nShame is put for an idol or for idolatry in Jer. 11:13 (see margin). Hos.\n9:10. See also Jer. 48:13, etc.\n\nLam. 2:14.-“Thy prophets have seen vain things for thee and\nexpulsions”: {6., the things which led to expulsion from the land and\ncaptivity.\nEze. 44:18.-“They shall not gird themselves with sweat”: {6., as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] , with anything that causeth sweat. The effect “sweat” being put\nfor the garments which cause it.\n\nHos. 4:18.-“Their drink is rebellious, or turned aside”: i.e., has caused\nthem to turn aside from God. Through not seeing the Metonymy, the\ntranslators try to find other meanings for nf (see text and margin).\nThe verse refers to Isa. 28:1; Isa. 5:11.\n\nMic. 1:5.-“What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And\nwhat are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?” i.e.,\nSamaria and Jerusalem were the cause of the transgression of\nIsrael:-“What is the cause of Jacob\'s trangression?”\n\nHab. 2:5.-“Yea, also because the wine transgresseth”: i.e., the effects\nof the wine was transgression; or, “Yea, so surely as wine causeth\ntrangression.”\n\nJoh. 3:19.-“And this is the judgment”: i.e., the cause of which\njudgment or condemnation was the effect: viz., “that light is come into\nthe world, and men loved darkness rather than light,” etc.\n\nJoh. 12:50.-“And | know that his commandment is life everlasting”:\nie., the effect of it is eternal life.\nJoh. 17:3.-“This is life eternal”: i.e., the effect of it is life eternal.\n\nRom. 6:6.-“The body of sin” is more than “sinful body.” It is more than\nmere character. The effect is put for the cause; which is the old nature,\nthat, through the body, works out sin; and sin is the effect; which is\nthus used, here and in other parts of this epistle (chap. 5:12-8:39), for\nthe old nature itself.\n\nWhereas, in chaps, 1:16-5:11, we have “sins,” as the product of\nthe Old nature, and the fruit of the old tree, we have, in 5:11-8:39,\n“sin,” or the Old nature, which causes and commits the “sins”; and the\nold tree itself which produces the fruits.\n\nRom. 7:7.-15 the law sin? (1.е., Is sin the effect of the law?) God\nforbid. But yet | knew not sin except through the law!”\n\nThere is no “nay” in the Greek. The word “but” brings out the\nmeaning: “God forbid that sin should be the effect of the law. But\nnevertheless.” So it is.\n\nRom. 7:24.-“The body of this death”; or, by Hypallage (q.v. [Note:\nWhich 5εε.]), as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] margin, “this body of death”: in which\ncase, “of death” is either, by Enallage, put for the adjective “dying,” or\nit may be the Metonymy of the effect, and the result “death” put for the\ncause-viz., all that leads up to, and ends in, death.\n\nRom. 8:6.-“To be carnally minded is death (i.e., the cause of death),\nbut to be spiritually minded is life and peace (i.e., ends in life and\npeace or peaceful life).” So verse 10.\n\n1Со. 12:6.-“And there are diversities of operations”: {6., of faculties\nand gifts effected by the Divine operations.\n\n1Co. 14:3.-“He that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and\nexhortation, and comfort”: /е., words which build up, exhort, and\ncomfort.\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] obtains this meaning by supplying the word “to.”\n2Co. 1:10.-“Who delivered us from so great a death”: i.e., from the\npersecution or trouble which threatened to kill them, and end in death.\n20ο. 11:23.-“In deaths oft.” This cannot, of course, mean that he had\ndied more than once; but that he had often been at death’s door, and\nin troubles which cause or bring about death.\nPhp. 1:13.-“My bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace”: i.e., the\neffect of his preaching made it manifest that his bonds were on\naccount of his service for Christ, and not for any crimes.\nHeb. 6:1.-“Dead works”: /е., works wrought by the Old nature. So\nHeb. 9:14, according to Rom. 6:23.\nRev. 6:8.-“And power was given unto them ... to kill with the sword,\nand with hunger, and with death”: i.e., with pestilence which produced\ndeath.\n\n(b) In Verbs\nPsa. 25:2.-“O my God, | trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not\nmine enemies triumph over me” (and thus be a cause of my being put\nto shame). So verse 20. Psa. 31:1 (2);Psa. 119:116, etc.\nPsa. 70:4 (5).-“Let them rejoice and be glad in Thee, all that seek\nthee”: i.e., let there be a cause of rejoicing and gladness to all seeking\nthee. Through not seeing the Metonymy the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] render it: “Let all those that\nseek thee rejoice and be glad in thee.”\nThe cause and effect are joined together in Psa. 5:11 (12), 12 (13).\nIsa. 28:16.-“Не that believeth shall not make haste.”\n\nHere, hastening away or flight is put as the effect for the confusion\nand shame which is the cause of it. See Rom. 9:33; Rom. 10:11. 1Pe.\n2:6, where the cause is put. The sense is that he that believeth will\nhave no need of hurried flight, he will wait God’s time.\n\niv. The THING MADE, for the material from which it is made or\n\nproduced\n\nPsa. 74:15.-“Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood”: ᾖ6., the\nrock from which the fountain flowed.\nIsa. 28:28.-“Bread is bruised”: i.e., the corn of which it is made. The\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] supplies “corn.” The sense is clear from verse 27 and\nJob. 28:5. In Psa. 104:14, we have the opposite of this in the\nMetonymy of the cause.\nIsa. 33:12.-“And the people shall be as the burnings of lime”: i.e., as\nfuel for lime-kilns.\nIsa. 47:2.-‘Take the millstones and grind meal”: i.e., grind corn, from\nwhich meal is made.\nIll. Metonymy of the Subject\nThe third division of Metonymy is when the subject is put for the\nadjunct: i.e., for some circumstance pertaining to (or joined to) the\nsubject: e.g., as when the place, or thing containing it, is put for that\nwhich is contained: the possessor for the thing possessed, etc. It is\ndivided into the five following heads:-\ni. The SUBJECT (i.e., the Thing or Action) for that which is\nconnected with it (i.e., the adjunct)\n1. Nouns\nGen. 3:7.-“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew\nthat they were naked.” They knew this fact before: but they did not\nknow all that was connected with it. Their nakedness, after the fall,\nreceived a new meaning.\n1Sa. 1:15 - ... have poured out my soul before the Lord”: i.e., my\ndesires and longings.\n1Ch. 12:38.-“All these ... came with a perfect heart”: {6., affections\nand desires.\nPsa. 7:9.-“God trieth the hearts and reins”: /е., the thoughts and\naffections and desires. This is clear from Psa. 51:6 (8); 73:11. Pro.\n23:7.\nPsa. 16:7.-“My reins (/е., my thoughts) also instruct me in the night\nseason.”\nPsa. 26:2.-“Examine me, О Lord, and prove me: try my reins (/е., my\nthoughts) and my heart.”\n\nSee also Jer. 11:20; Jer. 17:10; Jer. 20:12. Rev. 2:23.\nPsa. 38:8 (9).-“l have roared by reason of the disquietness of my\nheart” (i.e., my thoughts).\nPsa. 62:9.-“Pour out your heart before Him”: i.e., your thoughts and\ndesires. So Lam. 2:19.\nPsa. 62:10 (11).-“Set not your heart (i.e., your affections) upon them.”\nPro. 6:32.-“Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh heart.”\n(So Heb., see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] margin). Here heart is put for\n“understanding,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] ; because it is spoken of as the seat\nof wisdom and understanding. See Pro. 2:10; Pro. 8:5; Pro. 11:29;\nPro. 15:14; Pro. 16:21.\nPro. 7:7.-“A young man void of heart”: i.e., of understanding.\n\nIt is so used in Pro. 9:4; Pro. 9:16; Pro. 10:13; Pro. 10:21.\nPro. 15:32.-“He that heareth reproof possesseth an heart”: /.е., as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin, getteth understanding.\nPro. 16:23.-“The heart (i.e., the desires and thoughts) of the wise\nmaketh wise his mouth”: i.e., his words, by Metonymy of the cause.\nSee A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin.\nPro. 22:17.-“Apply thine heart (i.e., thy thoughts and powers) unto my\nknowledge.”\nPro. 26:7.-“The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the\nmouth of fools.” So A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “The legs of the lame\nhang loose!” The Heb. is: “The legs of the lame are lifted up” (see A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] margin). Here “legs” are put for the clothes which being lifted\nup expose the lameness. So when a fool attempts to utter a parable,\nhe soon exposes himself.\n\nPro. 28:26.-“He that trusteth in his own heart (i.e., understanding) is a\nfool.”\n\nIsa. 5:21.-“Woe unto them that are ... prudent before their face”: .e.,\nin themselves or in their own view of matters. See A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nmargin.\n\nIsa. 49:16.-“I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands”: i.e., as\nindelible as the lines graven in the palms of the hands, (with which we\nare born) will be My remembrance of thee.\n\nJer. 12:2.-“Thou art near in their mouth (i.e., their words, Met. of\ncause), and far from their reins” (i.e., their affections, Met. of subject).\nSee Isa. 29:13.\n\nHos. 4:11.-“Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart”:\nie., the understanding. That this is meant is clear from chap. 5:11.\nHos. 7:11.-“Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart”: i.e., without\nunderstanding.\n\nMat. 6:21.-“Where your treasure is, there will your heart (i.e., your\nthoughts and affections) be also.”\n\nMat. 16:19.-“Whatsoever thou ({6., by the word which thou shalt\nminister) shalt bind (see Met. of Adjunct below) on earth.” So Mat.\n18:18. Whatever this refers to, Peter had neither the power nor the\nauthority to pass it on to any one else.\n\nMat. 24:45.-“Who then (i.e., how great and blessed and happy) is a\nfaithful and wise servant?”\n\nJoh. 20:23.-“Whose soever sins ye (i.e., by the word which ye\nminister) remit.” See below under verbs. Whatever this may mean, it\nwas spoken to the apostles: and it is certain that they had no\ncommission, authority, or power to pass on that gift to others.\n\nAct. 1:11.-“This same Jesus, which is taken up from you”: i.e., from\nyour presence and company. So verse 22.\n\nAct. 1:24.-“Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts (/.e., the thoughts) of\nall men,” etc. See Psa. 139:2; Psa. 139:4.\nRom. 6:6.-“Our old man is (Gr., was) crucified with him”: i.e., not a\nman really, but our Old nature derived from Adam: our old self with its\ndesires and qualities and conditions. So Eph. 4:22. Compare Rom.\n6:12; Rom. 7:5; Rom. 7:7-8. 2Co. 7:1. Heb. 12:1.\nRom. 15:24.-“If first | be somewhat filled with you”: i.e., your company,\netc., as expressed in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] margin and verse 32.\nRom. 16:3; Rom. 16:7.-“My helpers in Christ Jesus”: i.e., in the\nservice of Christ.\n20ο. 5:17.-“If any man be in Christ he is a new creature”: i.e., he has\na new nature created within him. Thus a new standing is given to him,\nwith new thoughts and desires, etc. So Eph. 4:24. Compare Rom.\n12:2; Rom. 8:2; Rom. 8:5. 1Pe. 3:4 and Rom. 7:22. 2Co. 4:16.\nGal. 4:15.-“Where is then the blessedness ye spake of”: ᾖθ., how\ngreat was that blessedness ye spake of! for, etc.\nPhp. 1:21.-“To me to live is Christ’: /е., to serve Christ, to work and\nlabour for Him.\n\n2. Verbs\nWhere the action is put for the declaration concerning it: or where\nwhat is said to be done is put for what is declared, or permitted, or\nforetold as to be done: or where an action, said to be done, is put for\nthe giving occasion for such action.\n\nGen. 2:7.-See below, under Deu. 9:1.\n\nGen. 27:37.-“Behold, | have made him (Jacob) thy lord”: /е., | have\nblessed him; and this was part of the blessing.\n\nGen. 30:13.-“The daughters will call me blessed”: i.e., | am now a\nmother. For the parallels to this see Psa. 72:17. Luk. 1:48.\n\nGen. 34:12.-“Ask me never so much dowry and gift”: /.е., ask me to\ngive never so much, etc.\n\nGen. 35:12.-“And the land which | gave Abraham and Isaac”: i.e.,\nwhich | promised to give, or gave in promise.\n\nGen. 41:13.-“Me he restored (i.e., declared that | should be restored)\nunto mine office, and him he hanged (i.e., declared he should be\nhanged).”\n\nExo. 13:2.-“Sanctify unto me all the first-born”: i.e., declare in My\nname to the People that | sanctify (i.e., separate) them, etc. Which\nMoses did in verses 11 and 12.\nExo. 20:7.-“The Lord will not make him guiltless”: i.e., will not declare\nor pronounce. Or “hold,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nLev. 13:3.-“And the priest shall look on him, and he shall be unclean\n(or “uncleanse him,” for the verb is in the Piel)”: {θ., “he shall\npronounce him unclean,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nDeu. 9:1.-“Hear, О Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day”: i.e.,\nit is declared this day that thou art to pass over Jordan.\n\nWith this passage compare Gen. 2:17 : “In the day that thou eatest\nthereof thou shalt surely die”: {6., not that he should die in that day,\nbut it should be declared “in that day”: i.e., thou shalt be sentenced to\ndie.\n2Sa. 7:22.-“Wherefore thou art great”: {6., | will declare and praise\nThee as great: or, Thou shalt be known as great.\n\nSee other examples in Isa. 8:13. Jer. 1:5; Jer. 1:10. Eze. 13:19;\nEze. 20:26.\n\nIsa. 6:10.-“Make the heart of this people fat”: i.e., declare that it shall\nbecome so. (Isaiah could not make it fat, etc.) So Mat. 13:14. Mar.\n4:12. Luk. 8:10. Joh. 12:40. Act. 28:26-27. Rom. 11:8.\n\nJer. 1:10.-“I have this day set thee over the nations and over the\nkingdoms, to root out (i.e., to declare that they shall be rooted out),\nand to pull down (i.e., to prophesy that they shall be pulled down), and\nto destroy ({6., to declare that they shall be destroyed), and to throw\ndown (i.e., to foretell that they shall be thrown down),” etc.\nJer. 4:10.-“Then said 1, Ah, Lord God (Adonai-Jehovah)! surely thou\nhast vehemently (or verily) deceived this people (i.e., prophesied that\nthis People shall be deceived), saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas\nthe sword reacheth unto the soul.”\n\nThe people deceived themselves, assuring themselves that they\nshould have peace (see chap. 5:12). The Lord had declared by his\nprophet that they would so deceive themselves, and so it came to\npass that they were permitted to be deceived by their false prophets.\nJer. 38:23.-“Thou shalt burn this city with fire”: /.е., thou shalt declare\nthat it shalt be burnt. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it cause it to be burnt, as\nthough it were the Metonymy of the effect. It is clearly the Metonymy\nof the subject: for Zedekiah was not personally to set light to the city!\nEze. 13:19.-“And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of\nbarley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die\nand to save the souls alive that should not live”: to prophesy (falsely)\nthat they should die, and to promise life to those who should not live.\nEze. 13:22.-“Ye have ... strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he\nshould not return from his wicked way, by quickening him”: i.e., by\npromising him life. See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.\nEze. 20:25-26.-“Wherefore | gave them also statutes that were not\ngood, and judgments whereby they should not live (i.e., | permitted\nthem to receive such statutes from the heathen); And | polluted them\nin their own gifts,” etc.: ie., | suffered them to pollute themselves\ninthose gifts which, by the Law, they ought to have dedicated to Me.\nSee under Antanaclasis.\nHos. 6:5.-“Therefore have | hewed them by the prophets (i.e., | have\ndeclared by the prophets that they shall be hewed); | have slain them\nby the words of my mouth ({6., | have foretold by the words of my\nmouth that they shall be slain).”\nMat. 6:13.-“And lead us not into temptation”: i.e., suffer us not to be\nled.\nMat. 16:19.-“Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth ({6., declare to be\nbinding as a precept, etc.), shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever\nthou shalt loose on earth (i.e., declare to be not binding) shall be\nloosed in heaven.” But note that, whatsoever this may mean, it is\nnowhere stated that the apostle had either authority or power to\ntransmit the gift to others; still less to transmit the power to others to\ngive this gift! And in any case it refers to the “kingdom” and not to the\n“Church.” See also chap. 18:18.\nLuk. 7:29.-“And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans\njustified God, being baptized with the baptism of John”: i.e., declared\nGod to be just, and praised him for His justice and goodness; in that\nthey humbled themselves in confession of sin and were baptized by\nJohn. So the word is used again in verse 35 and chaps, 10:29; 16:15,\netc.\n\nJoh. 20:23.-“Whose soever sins ye remit (i.e., declare to be remitted)\nthey are remitted unto them: and whose soever sins ye retain ({6.,\ndeclare to be retained) they are retained.”\n\nHere note that the apostles had neither the authority nor the power\nto transmit this gift; still less to transmit the power to others to give it.\nAct. 10:15.-“What God hath cleansed”: ie., declared to be\n(ceremonially) clean: as is clear from verse 28.\n\nRom. 7:9.-“But when the commandment came”: j.e., when its power\nwas declared in revealing my impotence to obey it, I, in my\nexperience, suffered its penalty-death. See Gal. 3:23, below.\n2Со. 3:6.-“The letter killeth”: i.e., the Law of God manifests its power,\n\nin convincing of sin, and causing the sinner to condemn himself to\n\ndeath, which is the wages of sin. Compare Rom. 7:10, and Hos. 6:5.\n\nGal. 3:23.-“Before faith came”: i.e., before the Gospel was declared,\n\nand brought a new object for faith.\n\nJam. 2:21.-“Was not Abraham our father justified by works?” ie.,\n\ndeclared to be justified. See verse 23 and Gen. 22:12. So also verses\n\n24, 25.\n\nJam. 2:22.-“By works was faith made (i.e., declared to be, or\n\nmanifested to be) perfect”: {6., true and sincere.\n\nii. The CONTAINER for the contents: and the PLACE for the thing\nplaced in it\n\n1. Circuit is so put in all these cases for what is contained within\n\nit\n\nNum. 22:4.-“Now shall all this company lick up all our circuit”: {.6., “all\n\nthat are round about us” (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\n\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ).\n\nEzr. 1:6.-“And all their circuit”: i.e., all that were about them.\n2. Basket is put for its contents\nDeu. 28:5.-“Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough” (and\nverse 17 contra). Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has translated the latter\nMetonymy, but not the former. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] has translated neither. The container is put for the contents.\nHere, probably, the “basket” is put for the seed, and “kneading-trough”\nfor the meal; the beginning and the end of their labours.\n\n3. Wilderness is put for the wild beasts in it\n\nPsa. 29:8.-“The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness”: i.e., the\npeople and animals or inhabitants of the wilderness, as is clear from\nthe next verse, and Deu. 8:15.\n\n4. House is put for household\nGen. 7:1.-“Come thou and all thy house (i.e., thy family) into the ark.”\nGen. 30:30.-“When shall | provide for mine own house (i.e., family)\nalso?”\n\nGen. 43:16.-Joseph ... “said to the ruler of his house”: {6., of his\nservants. We use the word “establishment” in the same way: as the\nFrench also use “ménage.”\n\nExo. 1:21.-God “made them houses”: i.e., families, or progeny.\n\nExo. 2:1.-“And there went a man of the house (i-e., lineage) of Levi.”\n2Sa. 7:11.-“Jehovah telleth thee that make thee an house will\nJehovah”: i.e., a posterity, especially referring to Christ, Who should\nbe of “the seed of David,” and sit on His throne for ever. Luk. 1:31-33.\nObserve the Figure Epanadiplosis in the above rendering of the\nHebrew.\n\n1Ch. 10:6.-“So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died\ntogether” (i.e., all his family), as explained in 1Sa. 31:6.\n\nPsa. 49:11 (12).-“Their inward thought is that their houses (i.e., their\nfamilies) shall continue for ever.”\n\nIsa. 36:3.-“Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was\nover the house”: ᾖ6., the servants, or household.\n\nEze. 3:1.-“Go speak unto the house (i.e., the descendants) of Israel.”\nThe margin of Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible gives another reading: “sons.”\nEze. 27:14.-“They of the house of Togarmah”: i.e., of Togarmah’s\ndescendants. See Gen. 10:3.\n\nLuk. 19:9.-“This day is salvation come to this house”: i.e., to\nZacchzeus and his family.\n\nAct. 10:2.-Cornelius ... “feared God with all his house”: {6., all his\nfamily or household.\n\n1Co. 1:16.-Here the Greek word “house” is rendered “household”: {6.,\nfamily.\n\n1Ti. 3:4.-“One that ruleth well his own house”: {6., his own family.\n\n2Ti. 3:6.-“For of this sort are they that creep into houses”: i.e.,\nfamilies.\n\n2Ti. 4:19.-Here the Greek, “house,” is rendered “household”: {6.,\nfamily.\n\nTit. 1:11.-“Who subvert whole houses”: {6., families.\nHeb. 11:7.-“Noah ... prepared an ark to the saving of his house”: i.e.,\nof his family.\n\n5. Islands are put for their inhabitants\nIsa. 41:1.-“Keep silence before me, О islands”: /.е., the inhabitants of\nthe islands. So Isa. 42:4; and Isa. 51:5.\n\n6. Table is put for the things on it\nPsa. 23:5.-“Тпои preparest a table before me”: i.e., the good things\nupon it. As, when we say that such an one “keeps a good table,” we\nmean that it is spread bountifully.\nPsa. 78:19.-“Can God (6, the name of concentrated power) furnish\n(Heb., order, see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) a table in the\nwilderness?”: i.e., set the things upon it.\nUnder this head comes also\n\nHos. 14:2 (3).-“So will we render the calves of our lips.”\nHere, note first, that the word “render” is uéi (shilem), to offer or\npay a vow. Next, that the word “calves” means oxen; i.e., the animals\nused in sacrifice.\n\nThen we have two Metonymies. First, oxen are put (by Metonymy\nof the subject) for the sacrifices offered; and then the lips are put (by\nMetonymy of the cause) for the confession made by them. So that the\nverse really should read: “So shall we offer our sacrifices of\nconfession and prayer”; being exactly what is expressed in Psa. 51:17\n(19). “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, etc.,” and Heb. 13:15 :\n“By him ... let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is,\nthe fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” See also Psa. 69:30\n(31), 31 (32); 116:17; 141:2.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , while trying to\nimprove the translation, misses both Metonymies: “So will we render\nas bullocks the offering of our lips’-retaining the “letter” (“bullocks” and\n“lips”) and missing the “spirit” (sacrifices and confession).\n\nHeb. 13:10.-“We have an altar”: i.e., a sacrifice, referring to the sin-\noffering which was burned without the camp including the skin and the\ndung, no soul having a right to eat of it. So Christ is our sin-offering\noffered without the gate. That it is a figure is clear, for the verse reads\non: “We have an altar, whereof (ἐξ οὗ, ex hou, of which) they have no\nright to eat which serve the Tabernacle.” People do not eat “altars”!\nThe word “altar’ must, therefore, be used by Metonymy for the\nsacrifices offered upon it, which were eaten.\n\nBut, here, it is the sin-offering which is referred to, which no one\nmight eat; and therefore those who continued still “served the\ntabernacle” could have no part in Christ as the sin-offering.\n\n7. Mountain is put for mountainous region\nJos. 13:6.-“Mountain” is put for a mountainous region, translated here\n“hill country.” See Jdg. 7:24.\nJdg. 3:27; Jdg. 7:24.-“Mountain of Ephraim’: Mount Ephraim is put\nfor the mountainous region of Ephraim.\nMountains are also put for idols worshipped there; or for their\ninhabitants.\nJer. 3:23.-\"Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from\nthe multitude of mountains.” Here, “mountains” and “hills” are put for\nthe idols which were worshipped there. See Eze. 18:6; Eze. 18:11;\nEze. 18:15.\nMic. 1:4.-“And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the\nvalleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are\npoured down a steep place.” From a comparison with Psa. 68:2 and\n1Ch. 12:15 (16) it seems that “mountains” and “valleys” are here put\nfor their inhabitants. So Psa. 97:5.\n8. The World is put for its inhabitants\n\nJoh. 3:16.-“God so loved the world”: i.e., the inhabitants of the world,\nnow without distinction. Before it was only Israel without exception.\nSee further under Synecdoche.\n2Co. 5:19.-“Reconciling the world (i.e., the inhabitants of the world)\nunto himself.”\n41Jn. 2:2.-“He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but\nalso for the whole world”: i.e., for all the inhabitants of the world\nwithout distinction; as shown by the use of the word for “ours” (which\nis ἡμέτερος (heemeteros) and not ἡμῶν (heemapn), of us: i.e., “our,”\nas in the previous clause).\n\nHeemeteros denotes that which is peculiarly ours as distinct from\nothers’. See Act. 2:11; Act. 24:6; Act. 26:5. Rom. 15:4. 2Ti. 4:15. Tit.\n3:14. 1Jn. 1:3.\n\nSee also under Synecdoche and Ellipsis.\n1Jn. 5:19.-“The whole world (i.e., all the inhabitants of the world) lieth\nin [the power of] the wicked one.” See under Ellipsis.\n\n9. The World is put for a portion of its inhabitants\nJoh. 1:10.-“The world knew him not”: {6., people of the world.\nJoh. 3:17.-“That the world through him might be saved”: i.e., people in\nthe world without distinction.\n\nJoh. 6:33.-“The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,\n\nand giveth life unto the world”: i.e., to God’s People in the world.\nCompare verse 51. Hence Joh. 1:9; Joh. 3:17.\n\nJoh. 7:7.-“The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth”: ie., the\n\ninhabitants of the world, as without God.\n\nJoh. 14:17.-“The Spirit of truth; whom the world (i.e., men) cannot\n\nreceive.” So Joh. 15:19; Joh. 16:20; Joh. 16:33; Joh. 17:9; Joh. 17:14,\n\netc.\n\nJoh. 14:31.-“But that the world may know that | love the Father’: i.e.,\n\nthat the godly in the world. Hence Joh. 1:9 : “That was the true light,\n\nwhich, coming into the world (i.e., among men), lighteth every man,”\n\nwithout distinction of race or language, etc.; as heretofore only Israel,\n\nnot without exception, for that is not the fact. See under Periphrasis.\n\nJoh. 17:21.-“That the world may believe”: i.e., many in the world,\n\nwithout distinction.\n\n1Co. 11:32.-“That we should not be condemned with the world”: i.e.,\n\nwith the ungodly.\n\n1Jn. 3:1.-“Therefore the world (i.e., those who are without God)\nknoweth us not.” 1Jn. 4:5; 1Jn. 5:4-5, etc.\nSo the Devil is the Prince (or god) of this world: i.e., the ungodly\ninhabitants of it.\nJoh. 12:31; Joh. 14:30; Joh. 16:11. 2Co. 4:4. Eph. 2:2; Eph. 6:12.\nAnd conversely, the world may be put for God’s people.\n10. Ships are put for the souls in them\nIsa. 23:1.-“Howl, ye ships of Tarshish.” Here “ships” are put for the\npeople in them. So verse 14.\n11. Nests are put for the birds in them\nDeu. 32:11.-“As an eagle stirreth up her (Heb., masc.) nest”: i.e., her\nyoung in the nest, as is clear from the rest of the verse.\n12. Ophir is put for the gold of Ophir\nJob. 22:24.-“Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust; and Ophir (i.e., the\ngold of Ophir) as the stones of the brooks.”\n13. Cup is put for the wine in it\n\nJer. 49:12.-“Сир” is put for the contents: i.e., for the wine in it.\nEze. 23:32.-“Cup” is put for what is in it.\nLuk. 22:17; Luk. 22:20.-“Сир” is put for its contents, as is clear from\nverse 20, and Mar. 14:24 and Mat. 26:28.\n1Co. 10:16; 1Co. 10:21; 1Co. 11:25-28.-In these and other places\n“cup” is put for the contents of it.\n\n14. Region is put for its inhabitants\nGen. 47:15.-“All Egypt came unto Joseph”: /-e., all the Egyptians, as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.]\nPsa. 105:38.-“Egypt was glad when they departed”: {6., the Egyptians\nwere glad.\nPsa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God”:\nie., the Ethiopians.\nJob. 1:15.-“Sheba fell upon them”: i.e., the Sabeans, as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nSee 6:19 and Isa. 43:3.\nMat. 3:5.-“Then went out to him Jerusalem (i.e., the inhabitants of\nJerusalem) and all Judzea (i.e., the dwellers in Judaea),” etc.\nRom. 15:26.-“For it pleased Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain\ncontribution”: i.e., the saints in Macedones and Achaia.\n15. Grave is put for the dead buried in it\n\nIsa. 38:18.-“The grave (i.e., those who are buried in it) cannot praise\nthee.” This is clear from verse 19 and Psa. 115:17.\n\n16. Tents, etc., are put for the dwellers therein\nGen. 13:5.-“Tents” are put for the many servants, etc., who dwelt in\nthem.\nPsa. 78:67.-“He refused the tabernacle (or tent: /е., the tribe) of\nJoseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.”\nPsa. 87:2.-“The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the\ndwellings (i.e., tribes) of Jacob.”\nPsa. 91:10.-“Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling”: i.e.,\nthose who dwell in it.\nPro. 14:11.-Here “house” and “tabernacle” are put for those who dwell\nin them.\n\n17. The land or earth are put for its inhabitants\nGen. 6:11.-“The earth also was corrupt before God”: i.e., the\ninhabitants of the earth, as is clear from the next verse.\nGen. 11:1.-“And the whole earth was of one language, and of one\nspeech”: i.e., the people on the earth.\nGen. 18:25.-“Shall not the Judge of all the earth ({6., the people on\nthe earth) do right?”\nGen. 41:30.-“The famine shall consume the land”: i.e., the people in\nthe land.\nGen. 41:57.-“And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy”: {6.,\npeople from all countries.\nJdg. 5:7.-“The villages ceased”: {6., the inhabitants of the villages, or\nthe Peasantry. So also 5:11. See under Ellipsis and\nHomeeopropheron.\n1Sa. 14:29.-“Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land”:\nie., the People.\n2Sa. 15:23.-“And all the country (i.e., the people) wept with a loud\nvoice.”\nPro. 28:2.-“For the trangression of a land (i.e., of the people of a\ncountry) many are the princes thereof.”\nPsa. 9:8 (9).-“And he shall judge the world in righteousness”: i.e., the\ninhabitants of the world.\nPsa. 22:27 (28).-“All the ends of the world (i.e., the people living in the\nuttermost parts of the world) shall remember and turn unto the Lord.”\nSo Psa. 67:7 (8).\nPsa. 66:1.-“Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands”: i.e., уе\nnations.\nPsa. 66:4.-“All the earth (i.e., the peoples) shall worship thee.” So\nPsa. 82:8; Psa. 96:1. Eze. 14:13.\nMat. 5:13.-“Ye are the salt of the earth”: i.e., the peoples.\n\n“Salt” also is used by Metaphor (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ) for its\npreserving effects.\nLand is also put for its spoils.\n\nIsa. 43:3.-“Egypt’ is put for the spoils of Egypt.\n\n18. Theatre is put for its spectacle\n1Со. 4:9.-“For we are made a theatre to the world”: i.e., a spectacle,\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.]\n\n19. City, etc., put for its inhabitants\n1Sa. 22:19.-“And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he”: i.e., its\ninhabitants.\nJer. 4:29.-“The whole city shall flee”: i.e., all the inhabitants of the city.\nIsa. 14:31.-“Cry, О city”: i.e., ye inhabitants of the city.\nJer. 26:2.-“Speak unto all the cities of Judah”: ie, to their\nrepresentatives.\nJer. 48:8.-“Here “city,” valley,” and “plain” are put for their respective\ninhabitants.\n\nJer. 49:23.-“Hamath” is put for its inhabitants. So Arpad too in verse\n24, Damascus.\n\nMic. 6:9.-“The Lord’s voice crieth unto the city”: {6., to the inhabitants.\nMat. 11:21; Mat. 11:23.-“Chorazin,” “Bethsaida,” and “Capernaum,”\nare put for their inhabitants.\nMat. 23:37.-“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem”: i.e., the people that dwelt\nthere.\nMar. 1:5.-“Judzea’” is put for its inhabitants.\nMar. 1:33.-“And all the city was gathered”: i.e., all its inhabitants.\nAct. 8:25.-They “preached the gospel to many villages of the\nSamaritans”: /е., to their inhabitants. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] evades and hides\nthe Metonymy by rendering it “in many,” etc.\n\n20. Heaven is put for God, Who dwells there\nPsa. 73:9.-“They set their mouth against the heavens”: i.e., against\nGod, Who dwells there.\n\nThe rest of the verse confirms this:-“Their tongue (Met. for words)\nwalketh through the earth.” Here “earth” is put for the people who\ndwell upon it; and so “heaven” is put for Him who dwells there.\n\nSo Dan. 4:26; Dan. 4:29. 2Ch. 32:20.\nMat. 3:2.-“The kingdom of heaven”: i.e., of God; the sphere in which\nGod rules and reigns. For the word βασιλεία means dominion rather\nthan territory.\n\nThe expression occurs only in Matthew, and in this gospel we have\nit 35 times. Whether the Lord spoke in Hebrew or Aramaic is open to\nquestion: but it is certain He did not speak in Greek.\n\nIt is also certain that several passages, which are exactly parallel\nin every other respect, are unlike in this: e.g., Mat. 11:11 : “He that is\nleast in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he (i.e., John the\nBaptist),” and Luk. 7:28 : “He that is least in the kingdom of God is\ngreater than he.”\n\nHow is this difference to be explained? Only by the assumption\nthat the Lord speaking in Aramaic, or Hebrew, used the words\n“kingdom of heaven.” Then, in putting this into Greek, in Matthew the\nfigure was preserved, literally; while in Luke it was translated,\n“kingdom of God.”\n\n“Heaven” is frequently put for “God,” who dwells there. We say”\nHeaven forbid,” “Heaven protect us,” etc. So the lost son says, “I have\nsinned against heaven.” He means, against God!\nThis does not at all affect the truths concerning the kingdom, as\ncontrasted with the Church.\n\nWhile the kingdom or reign is God\'s, yet it has different aspects. In\nMatthew, the expression “Kingdom of heaven” corresponds with the\naspect of the kingdom as presented in that Gospel.\n\nOur suggestion is that in each case the words “kingdom of\nheaven” were the words spoken in Aramaic; but that, in presenting\nthem in Greek, the figure is translated, and given idiomatically in Mark\nand Luke.\n\nThe effect of this figure, then, here, is that, by the figure of\nEnallage, the emphasis is placed on the words “heaven” and “God,”\nand not on the word “kingdom”; and by the figure of Heterosis, the\nplural, “heavens” (as it is in the Greek) is put for the singular to still\nmore emphasize the expression.\n\nHence the phrase means that this reign is the Divine or Heavenly\nDominion, in contrast with all the kingdoms which are of or from this\nworld.\n\nIn Matthew, the aspect of it is Old Testament and Jewish; while in\nthe other gospels the aspect is larger and wider in its sphere.\nThe reign and rule of God Comprises all in time and space, and\nmany are the spheres and departments embraced within it. Thus,\nwhile the Church of God is embraced in it, the church is not the\nkingdom. While Israel is embraced in it, Israel does not exhaust the\nreign and dominion of God. While the Gentiles come within the reach\nof that dominion, they are neither the kingdom itself nor the church. All\nthese are distinct from each other; and yet all are embraced in the\nuniversal reign of heaven; the church occupying its own unique\nposition as the Body of Christ, in whom all things are to be headed-up\n(Eph. 1:10; Eph. 1:20-23).\n\nMat. 21:25.-“The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven (i.e.,\nfrom God), or of men?” So Luk. 20:4.\nLuk. 15:18.-“Father, | have sinned against heaven (i.e., against God),\nand before thee.”\nJoh. 3:27.-“A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from\nheaven”: i.e., from God (who dwells there).\n\n21. Heart is put for nature and character\nPsa. 24:4.-“He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.”\nHere “hands” are put for the works done by them; while “heart” is\nnot the muscular organ of the body, but is put for the inward character\nPsa. 84:2 (3).-“My soul longeth (i.e., | long), yea, even fainteth for the\ncourts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God”:\nie., my soul and my body, my whole being. See also under\nSynecdoche.\n1Pe. 3:4.-“Let it be the hidden man of the heart”: i.e., the new nature\nimplanted within.\n\n22. Belly is put for heart or thoughts\nJob. 15:35.-” Their belly prepareth deceit’: i.e., their thoughts and\ndesires.\nPro. 18:8.-“The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go\ndown into the chambers of the belly”: i.e., the innermost thoughts and\nfeelings, moving them as the belly is actually moved by excitement.\nSee Hab. 3:16. So Pro. 26:22.\nPro. 20:27.-“The spirit of man is the candle (or lamp: /.е., light) of the\nLord, searching all the inward parts of the belly”: i.e., moving and\ninfluencing the thoughts and feelings, as the belly itself is moved.\nJoh. 7:38.-“He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of\nhis belly shall flow rivers of living water.” Here, “belly” is put for the\ninnermost thoughts and feelings, and what the Scripture hath said of\nthis is written in Pro. 18:4.\n\niii. The possessor is put for the thing possessed\n\n1. Nations are put for countries\n\nDeu. 9:1.-“To possess nations”: /.е., their countries, and all that they\ncontained.\n2Sa. 8:2.-“And he smote Moab, and measured them (i.e., the territory\nof the Moabites) with a line, casting them (i.e., the cities within it) to\nthe ground.”\nPsa. 79:7.-“They have devoured Jacob”: i.e., the riches and good\nthings of the descendents of Jacob.\nMar. 5:35.-“While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the\nsynagogue”: i.e., from his house: ᾖθ., his servants, whom he\nemployed.\n2. Person is put for possessions\n\nGen. 15:3.-“And, lo, one born in my house inherits me”: i.e., my\npossessions or property.\n2Co. 11:20.-“For ye suffer ... if a man devour you”: i.e., your goods or\nproperty, as expressed in Psa. 14:4.\n\n3. Princes are put for the thousands whom they led\nMat. 2:6.-“Art not the least among the princes of Judah.” Here the\nprinces who led-men by the thousand are put for the thousands or\nfamilies whom they led. See 1Sa. 10:19.\n\nIn Mic. 5:2 (1), we have the word “thousands” literally instead of\nthe figure Metonymy. So Jdg. 6:15, and 1Sa. 10:19. Our English\n“hundreds,” as applied to a territorial division, has the same origin.\n\n4. God is put for the sacrifices offered to Him\nJos. 13:33.-“The Lord God of Israel was their (the Levites’)\ninheritance, as he said unto them”: see verse 14. From which it is\nclear that the name of Jehovah is put for the sacrifices which were\noffered to him, and which He accepted: {.6., their priesthood, as stated\nin 18:7. Deu. 10:9. Eze. 44:28. Num. 18:8; Num. 18:20. Deu. 18:1-3.\n5. Christ is put for His people\n\nAct. 9:4.-“Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” i.e., My People who\nbelong to Me. See verse 5; and compare verses 1 and 2.\n1Со. 12:12.-“For as the body is one, and hath many members and all\nthe members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is\nChrist” or the Christ: i.e., Christ mystical; not personal; as is clear from\nverse 13 and what follows.\nCol. 1:24.-“Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that\nwhich is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh”: i.e., Christ\nmystical; not personal; as is clear from what follows: “for His body’s\nsake, which is the Church.”\n\n6. God is put for the power manifested by Him\nLuk. 1:35.-“The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee”: i.e., the\nHighest shall overshadow thee; and His power, which is infinite, shall\nbe put forth upon or manifested in thee.\n\niv. The object is put for that which pertains or relates to it\n\n1. Jesus is put for His doctrine\n2Co. 11:4.-“For if he that cometh (i.e., the one who is coming, perhaps\nfrom Jerusalem or the Twelve) preacheth another Jesus”: ᾖθ., a\ndifferent doctrine or teaching concerning Jesus. See Gal. 1:8.\n\n2. A god is put for his worship\nExo. 32:1.-“Make us a god which shall go before us”: i.e., whom we-\nmay worship and honour. Compare 1К!. 12:28.\n\n3. Attributes are put for the praise and celebration of them\nPsa. 29:1.-“Give unto the Lord glory and strength”: How can we give\nthese to God? We can praise Him for these, but we cannot give them.\nThey are thus put, by Metonymy, for the praise given to Him for his\nglory and strength. So also Psa. 96:7.\n\nPsa. 8:2 (3).-“Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou\n\nordained strength”: i.e., praise for the manifestation and putting forth\n\nof God\'s strength, as is clear from Mat. 21:16, where it is rendered\n\n“Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise.”\n4. Burden is put for the prophecy\n\nIsa. 21:1.-“The burden of the desert of the sea.” Here, “burden” is put\n\nfor the prophecy of Divine punishment which follows. So Isa. 13:1; Isa.\n\n23:1, etc., etc. Mal. 1:1 The burden might be in words, or by a vision.\n5. Sin is put for the offering for sin\n\nGen. 4:7.-“Sin (i.e., a sin offering) lieth at the door.” So the word “sin”\n\nis frequently used for a sin offering. See Exo. 30:10. Lev. 4:3; Lev.\n\n6:25. Num. 8:8. Psa. 40:6 (7), etc. Lev. 7:5; Lev. 7:7. 1Sa. 6:3-4, and\n\n2Co. 5:21.\n\nExo. 29:14.-‘It is a sin”: i.e., an offering which atones for sin.\n\nHos. 4:8.-“They eat up the sin, ({.6., the sin-offering) of my people.”\n2Со. 5:21.-“Не hath made him to be sin (i.e., a sin-offering) for us.”\nSee- Isa. 53:10. Eph. 5:2.\n\n6. Promise is put for the faith which receives it\nRom. 9:8.-“The children of the promise are counted for the seed”: i.e.,\nwho believe and receive the promise of God, as is clear from 4:12, 16.\nGal. 3:7; Gal. 3:29; Gal. 4:28.\n\n7. Covenant is put for the two tables of stone\n1Ki. 8:21.-“l have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the\ncovenant of the Lord (i.e, the two tables of stone) which he made with\nour fathers,” etc., as is clear from Exo. 34:28 Rom. 9:4. See especially\nDeu. 9:9; Deu. 9:11; Deu. 9:15; Deu. 9:17.\n\n8. Blood is put for blood-shedding\nIsa. 33:15.-“That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood”: from\nlistening to those who shed blood, according to Pro. 1:10-11.\n9. Double is used for that which is complete, thorough, or ample;\nand of full compensation, whether of judgment or of blessing\n\nThis Metonymy arose out of the literal use of the word. See\nGen. 43:12, where the “double money” was to pay for the corn taken\nthat time as well as for that which was taken the time before.\nExo. 16:5.-The “double” manna was “twice as much,” so as to be\nenough for two days instead of one.\nExo. 22:7; Exo. 22:9, where the thief was to restore “double”: i.e., to\nmake compensation in full.\nDeu. 15:18, where the liberated bond-servant was worth the “double”\nof an hireling in serving six years instead of three (compare Isa. 16:14;\nIsa. 21:16).\n\nFrom this literal use of the words mishneh (ida) and kiphlayim\n(6666), the word “double” is used by Metonymy, as follows:-\nJob. 11:6.-“The secrets of wisdom are double to that which is”: /.e., far\nbeyond, or much more.\n\nJob. 41:13.-“Who can come to him (leviathan) with his double ({6.,\nstrong) bridle.” Here. it is 666 (kephel) in the singular.\n\nIsa. 40:2.-“For she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for all her\nsins”: i.e., full punishment.\n\nIsa. 61:7.-“For your shame ye shall have double, and for confusion\nthey shall rejoice in their portion: therefore, in their land they shall\npossess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.”\n\nHere, we have the “double” denoting not full punishment (as in Isa.\n40:2), but complete compensation. And this is marked in the\nalternation of the four lines: where we have this completeness in the\nfirst and third lines; and the consequent joy and rejoicing in the\nsecond, and fourth lines:-\n\na For your shame ye shall have complete compensation or full\n\nacquittal.\nЬ And for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion.\n\na Therefore in their land they shall possess the complete\n\npardon.\nЬ — Everlasting joy shall be unto them.\nJer. 17:18.-“Destroy them with double destruction”: ie., with a\ncomplete destruction.\nJer. 16:18.-“And first | will recompense their iniquity and their sin\ndouble”: i.e., with a complete and thorough punishment. Not literally\ndouble, but completely.\nZec. 9:12.-“Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-\nday do | declare that | will render double unto thee”: ie., | will\ncompletely pardon you and give you full compensation for all your\ntroubles.\n1Ti. 5:17.-“Let the elders that rule be counted worthy of double ({6.,\nliberal) honour (/.е., maintenance).” See under /diom.\n\nv. The thing signified is put for the sign\n\nExo. 8:23 (19).-“And | will put a redemption between my people and\nthy people ({6., the judgment, which would be the sign of the\nredemption): for to-morrow will this sign be.”\nNum. 6:7.-“Because the consecration (Heb. separation, see margin)\nof his God is upon his head”: {6., the hair, which was the sign and\nsymbol of his separation.\n\nDeu. 16:3.-“Unleavened bread ... even the bread of affliction”: i.e., the\nbread which was the sign and symbol of their affliction in Egypt.\n\nDeu. 22:15; Deu. 22:17.-Here the Metonymy is supplied in italics, the\nletter of the passage being so obviously figurative.\n\n2Ki. 13:17.-“The arrow of the Lord’s deliverance”: i.e., the sign of the\nfuture deliverance which the Lord would work for His People.\n\n1Ch. 16:11.-“Seek the Lord and his strength”: i.e., the Ark of the\nCovenant, which was the sign and symbol of His Presence and\nstrength. So Psa. 105:4, according to Psa. 132:8.\nPsa. 78:6.-“And delivered his strength into captivity” i.e., the Ark of the\nCovenant, referring to 1Sa. 4:11, etc. See Psa. 132:8.\n\nIsa. 49:6.-“It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise\nup the tribes of Jacob and to restore the desolations of Israel”: i.e., the\nland and the cities of Israel which have been reduced to desolation.\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] renders it “preserved,” not seeing the figure, but\nit puts “desolations” in the margin.\n\nEze. 7:27.-“The prince shall be clothed with desolation”: i.e., with his\ngarments rent, which was the sign of his mourning.\n\nIV. Metonymy of the Adjunct\nThe fourth division of Metonymy is called the Metonymy of the Adjunct\n(or Relation), and is the opposite of Metonymy of the Subject.\n\nIt is so called because some circumstance pertaining to the\nsubject is put for the subject itself; e.g., the contents for the container,\nthe possession for the possessor, etc. It is divided into the seven\nfollowing parts:-\ni. The adjunct or accident is put for the subject\n\nThat which is an accident, or belongs to anything, is put for the subject\nor the thing itself to which it belongs.\n\n1. The abstract is put for the concrete; or, the attribute is put for\n\nthat to which anything is attributed\n\nGen. 31:54.-“Then Jacob killed beasts upon the mount”: i.e., he\noffered sacrifices, as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it. Here, by\nMetonymy, the abstract is put for its concrete.\nGen. 42:38.-“Then shall ye bring down my grey hairs (i.e., me, in my\nold age) with sorrow to the grave.”\nGen. 46:34.-“For every shepherd is an abomination (ie., an\nabominable person) unto the Egyptians.”\n\n1Sa. 15:29.-“And also the eternity of Israel will not lie nor repent.”\nHere, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] renders it “Strength,” but the attribute “Eternity”\nis put for Him to whom it is attributed: i.e., the eternal One: i.e., God.\nSee A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin.\n\n2Sa. 23:23.-“And David set him over his listeners”: i.e., those who\nstood at David’s door and listened for his command. Hence his\nbodyguard. See 20:23. 1Ki. 1:38.\n\nNeh. 5:9.-“Because of the reproach (i.e., the reproachful deeds) of the\nheathen our enemies.”\n\nJob. 5:16.-“So the poor hath hope, and iniquity (i.e., the iniquitous\nman) stoppeth his mouth.”\n\nJob. 31:21.-“If | have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when |\nsaw my help ({6., those who helped me or would be on my side) in the\ngate.”\n\nJob. 32:7.-“I said, Days (i.e., men of days, or men of full age) should\nspeak, and multitude of years (i.e., aged men) should teach wisdom.”\nPsa. 12:1 (2).-“Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth: for the faithful\nfrom the sons of men fail”: i.e., faithful men fail. So Psa. 31:23 (24).\n2598. 20:19.\n\nPsa. 65:8 (9).-“They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at\nthy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to\nrejoice”: [.Θ., thou makest those who go out in the morning and return\nin the evening to sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.] See under\nEllipsis.\n\nPsa. 68:18 (19).-“Thou hast led captivity ({6., captives) captive.” Isa.\n49:24. Jer. 29:14.\n\nPsa. 110:3.-“From the womb of the morning: thou hast (or shall be)\nthe dew of thy youth”: i.e., thy young men shall be born to thee as dew\nis born in the morning.\nPro. 23:21.-“For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:\n\nand drowsiness (i.e., the sluggard) shall clothe a man (i.e., himself)\n\nwith rags.”\n\nIsa. 57:13.-“Vanity (i.e., vain men) shall take them.” So Psa. 144:4.\n\nJam. 4:14.\n\nJer. 2:5.-They “have walked after vanity (i.e., vain things, or idols),\n\nand are become vain.” See under Paronomasia. So Deu. 32:21. Jer.\n\n14:22, and compare Act. 14:15.\n\nEze. 44:6.-“And thou shalt say unto rebellion”: i.e., to the rebellious\n\nPeople.\n\nAmo. 8:3.-“And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day.”\nHere, through missing the Metonymy in the first part of this\n\nsentence, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\n\nour English Bible, 1611.] has been obliged to alter the latter part, and\n\nput in the margin, “Heb., shall howl.” But if we note that “songs” are\n\nput for singers, then we have perfect sense:-“And the singers of the\n\ntemple shall howl in that day.”\n\nLuk. 1:78.-“Whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us”: i.e.,\n\nthe morning star which precedes the day. So John the Baptist, as the\n\n“morning star,” preceded Christ, Who is “the Sun of Righteousness.”\nSee Isa. 9:2 (1); 60:1, 2. Mal. 4:2 (3:20), etc.\n\nJoh. 11:40.-“Said | not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou\nshouldest see the glory (i.e., the glorious work) of God?”\n\nRom. 3:30.-“Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision\nby faith and uncircumcision through faith.” Here, “circumcision” is put\nfor those who are circumcised; and uncircumcision for uncircumcised\npersons, as in 15:8 and Gal. 2:9; Gal. 2:12.\n\nRom. 8:19.-“The earnest expectation of the creation ({6., created\nthings or creatures) waiteth.”\n\nRom. 11:7.-“But the election (i.e., elect persons) hath obtained it.”\nEph. 1:21.-Here, the attributes are put for the beings who possess\nthem:-“Far above all princes, and powerful beings, and mighty ones,\nand lords”: i.e., all spiritual beings in heavenly places. See also under\nSynonymia and Polysyndeton.\n\nPhp. 1:16.-“Supposing to add affliction to my bonds”: i.e., my captivity.\nSee also under Prosapodosis.\n\n1Pe. 2:17.-“Love the brotherhood”: i.e., the brethren. Compare 1Ре.\n5:9.\n2. Other adjuncts also are put for the subjects to which they\npertain: as Light for the sun, Oil for anointing, etc.\n\nGen. 34:29.-“And all their strength”: i.e., wealth, as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nExo. 14:4.-“And | will be honoured upon Pharaoh and upon all his\npower.” Heb. is geél: ie., his power, which is put by Metonymy for\nhis army, which was the expression of his power. See below 1Sa.\n14:48.\nLev. 13:4.-“Then the priest shall shut up the plague seven days”: i.e.,\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , “him that hath the plague.” See verses 13, 31, 50.\nDeu. 8:17.-“And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of\nmine hand hath gotten me this strength”: i.e., wealth, as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\n1Sa. 14:48.-“And he gathered a power” (Heb. geé, i.e., an host), as\nin A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] See Exo. 14:4.\n1Ki. 7:9.-“From the foundation unto the coping.” Heb. édgiu\n(tephachoth), spans, put by Metonymy for the height: i.e., from the\nfoundation to the summit.\n\nJob. 6:22.-“Give a reward (or perhaps “bribe”) for me of your\nstrength”: i.e., “of your substance,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ; 19., that which\nyour strength has procured.\nJob. 31:26.-“If | beheld the light when it shined.”\n\nHere “the light” is put for the sun, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] (see margin). So\nalso 37:21 and Hab. 3:4.\n\nPro. 5:10.-“Lest strangers be filled with thy strength”: i.e., thy wealth,\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.]\n\nPro. 15:6.-“In the house of the righteous is much strength”: ie.,\ntreasure, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.]\n\nIsa. 1:18.-“Though your sins be as scarlet.” It is a question whether\nhere “sins” be not put for sinners. Certainly persons are spoken of,\nand it is not easy to think of “sins,” as such, becoming white! It is the\nsinner himself who is thus made “whiter than snow.” Psa. 51:7.\n\nIsa. 10:14.-“And my hand hath found (or found means to reach) as a\nnest the strength of the peoples”: i.e., their riches, gotten by their\nstrength, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.]\n\nIsa. 10:27.-“Because of the oil”: i.e., the anointing, as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nBut, from the reference to Gideon’s exploits which we have in verse\n26, the sense may be: “And yoke snapt at sight of oil”: i.e., as Midian’s\nyoke was distended till it «περί before the ой (or resin) burning in\nGideon’s lamps, so will Asshur’s yoke, again, recoil (enlF, verse 26)\nfrom thy neck, before the hot “blast” (see 37:7, and compare Psa.\n18:15 (16); see, too, 2Th. 2:8).\n\nIsa. 30:6.-“They will carry their strength ({6., riches) upon the\nshoulders of young asses.” Here “strength” is put for the riches and\npresents which Israel’s ambassadors were taking down to Egypt, to\ninduce Egypt to help Israel against Assyria. In verses 2 and 3,\n“strength” is used literally. But in the next verse (7), it is put by\nMetonymy for “Egypt,” in whose strength they trusted.\n\nIsa. 30:7.-“Their strength is to sit still.”\n\nThese words are usually taken as an exhortation to the Lord’s\npeople to sit still and do nothing. But the fact is just the opposite. They\nare spoken of Egypt, on whom Israel was relying for help against the\nAssyrians. See verses 1, 3: “The strength of Pharaoh” was what they\ntrusted in. But Jehovah declared that that would be a vain trust, for\n\n“The Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:\n\nTherefore have | cried concerning this,\nTheir strength is to sit still:”\nie., Egypt, when Israel’s ambassadors arrived there (verses 4-6),\nwould sit still, and not help them at all. “Strength” is put by Metonymy\nfor Egypt, in the strength of which Israel trusted.\nJer. 20:5.-“Moreover | will deliver all the strength ({6., all the riches\nwhich are procured by strength) of this city ... into the hand of their\nenemies.”\nJer. 40:7.-“And of the poverty of the Land”: i.e., the poor people of the\ncountry.\nEze. 38:4.-“And all thy power”: /.e., “all thine army,” as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nMat. 8:3.-“His leprosy was cleansed”: i.e., the leper. See verses 2, 3,\nand compare Mar. 1:42.\nMar. 14:54.-And Peter “warmed himself at the light”: i.e., at the fire, as\nin A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] See Joh. 18:18.\nAct. 14:15.-“We ... preach unto you that ye should turn from these\nvanities (i.e., idols) unto the living God.”\nNote that the term “Living God” is generally used when idols are\nmentioned or implied in the context (See 1Th. 1:9-10, etc.).\nGal. 3:13.-“Being made a curse for us”: i.e., accursed, one under the\n\ncurse of the Law.\n\nEph. 5:8.-“For ye were sometimes darkness ({6., dark and ignorant),\n\nbut now are ye light (i.e., enlightened ones) in the Lord.”\n\nii.

[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\n\nBible, 1611.] But see Jer. 49:32 below.\n\nPsa. 135:7.-“Bringing the wind out of His treasures”: i.e., treasuries,\n\nas the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] here properly renders the figure.\n\nIsa. 23:3.-“The harvest of the river”: {6., the country through which the\n\nriver flows.\nJer. 49:32.-‘I will scatter into all winds”: i.e., all quarters (Heb., every\nwind).\n\nEze. 5:12.-“I will scatter a third part into all the winds”: i.e., into all\nquarters.\n\nEze. 26:5.-“It shall be the spreading of nets”: /е., a place for the\nspreading of nets, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nHos. 9:6.-“Thorns shall be in their tabernacles”: {6., in the places\nwhere their tents were formerly pitched.\n\nAmo. 8:5.-“Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may\nsell corn? and the sabbath that we may open wheat (i.e., granaries).”\nNot “set forth wheat,” as in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] The translators have\nstumbled over the verb (see margin) through not seeing the Metonymy\nof the noun.\n\nMat. 2:11.-“And when they had opened their treasures”: i.e., their\ntreasuries or caskets containing them; good and precious presents.\nSo Psa. 135:7. Mat. 12:35, etc.\n\nMat. 12:35.-“A good man out of the good treasure”: {6., treasury. The\nwords “of the heart” go out of the Text with the Textual Critics and R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nMat. 13:52.-“Which bringeth forth out of his treasure ({6., treasury)\nthings new and old.”\n\nMat. 24:31.-“They shall gather his elect from the four winds”: i.e., from\nthe four quarters of the earth. The elect Nation of Israel is referred to.\nMat. 25:10.-“They that were ready went in with him to the marriage”:\ni.e., to the place where the marriage was to be celebrated.\n\nMat. 25:21; Mat. 25:23.-“Enter thou into the joy of the lord”: {6., into\nthe place where the lord manifested his joy.\n\nLuk. 21:4.-“All these have of their abundance cast in unto the\nofferings of God”: i.e., into the chest or receptacle which received\nthose offerings made to God. Compare Mat. 15:5; Mat. 27:6.\n\nAct. 16:13.-“Where we supposed was prayer”: {6., a place of prayer.\nSee verse 16. The word rendered “supposed” means that they looked\nfor and expected to find a place of prayer as lawfully and legally\nallowed. Compare Luk. 3:23.\n\n1Co. 9:24.-“Know ye not that they which run in a race-course (or\nstadium)”: i.e., a race which is run there.\n\nGal. 2:12.-“For before that certain came from James”: i.e., from\nJerusalem, where James presided. See Act. 12:17; Act. 21:18.\nHeb. 12:1.-“Let us run the race-course (or stadium)”: i.e., the race\nwhich is run there.

Age (αἰών, αἰφη), a period of time, is put for what takes place\nin it\n\nMat. 13:22.-“The cares of this world”: lit., “of this age”: i.e., the things\nof this life.

So Heb. 11:3, where the verb is\nκαταρτίζω (katartizq), to adjust, prepare, or restore.\n3. Years is put for what happens in them\nPro. 5:9.-“Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years (i.e.,\nthy strength and labours and life) unto the cruel.”\n4. Day, or Days, is put for what transpires in them, the context\nshowing what it is\nDeu. 4:32.-“For ask now of the days that are past”: /е., of what has\nbeen done in them, past history.\nJob. 18:20.-“They that come after him shall be astonied at his day”:\n{9., at his fate.\nJob. 24:1.-“Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do\nnot they that know him see his days?” i.e., understand His dealings\nwith them.\nPsa. 37:13.-‘The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day\n(i.e., his punishment) is coming.”\nPsa. 137:7.-“Remember, О Lord, the children of Edom in the day (i.e.,\ncalamities) of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the\nfoundations thereof.”\n\nIsa. 13:6.-“Howl ye; for the day (i.e., the judgment) of the Lord is at\nhand.”\n\nEze. 21:29.-“The wicked, whose day is come”: i.e., whose calamity or\njudgment shall have an end.

[Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\ntranslates the Metonymy “sacrifices,” for which in the Hebrew is put\n“feasts”; lit., “kill the feasts”: {6., the sacrifices.\n\nIn Mal. 2:3, where it is so very clear, the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] leaves\nthe word “feasts” and does not render it, as in Isa. 29:1.\n\nMal. 2:3.-“Spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your\nsolemn feasts”: i.e., of your sacrifices.\n8.

Summer is put for the fruits gathered in it\nIsa. 16:9.-“For the shouting for thy summer.” Here, “summer” is put for\nthe fruits of the summer, and is so rendered. So 2Sa. 16:1. Jer. 40:10,\nand Amo. 8:1. So the word “harvest” in the next clause is put for the\ncorn and fruits of the harvest.\n\n10.

But cir does not mean primarily to praise, but\nto embellish or adorn or trim the song.\n\nExo. 15:2.-“The Lord is my strength and song”: i.e., He whom | praise\nin my song. So Psa. 118:14, and compare verses 15, 16.\n\nHere, “strength” is the Metonymy of effect: i.e., producing strength in\nme. So that the whole verse means: “Jah maketh me strong, and is\nthe subject of my song.”\n\nDeu. 28:8.-“And in every sending forth of thy hand”: i.e., all things\nwhich thy hand accomplishes.

Hence it was called faéida\n(aveeyqbnah), desire or appetite, from faa (avah), to desire.\n\nHere, then, we have first the plant or berry put for the condiments\nmade from it, and then the condiments put for the desire they created.\nThe meaning is that not only shall appetite or desire fail, but that\ncondiments and stimulants shall be powerless to produce their usual\neffect.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] makes the sentence\nabsurd by translating the figure literally: “The caper-berry shall fail.”\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , with its elegant idiomatic version, much better conveys\nthe essential meaning of the passage: “And desire shall fail.”\n\nIsa. 33:15.-“That stoppeth his ears from hearing of bloods.” Here,\n“bloods” is first put for blood-shedding, and then blood-shedding is put\nfor the murderers who shed it. See Pro. 1:11.\n\nIn the New Testament, the expression “the blood of Christ” is the\nfigure Metalepsis; because first the “blood” is put (by Synecdoche) for\nblood-shedding: i.e., the death of Christ, as distinct from His life; and\nthen His death is put for the perfect satisfaction made by it, for all the\nmerits of the atonement effected by it: /е., it means not merely the\nactual blood corpuscles, neither does it mean His death as an act, but\nthe merits of the atonement effected by it and associated with it.\nHos. 14:2 (3).-“So will we render the calves of our lips.” Here, “calves”\nare put by Metonymy (of Subject) for sacrifices, and then, by another\nMetonymy, these sacrifices are put for the confession and praises\nrendered. See under Metonymy, pages 574 and 575.\nRom. 3:25.-“Through faith in his blood”: i.e., through faith in the merits\nof the atonement accomplished by it.\nRom. 5:9.-“Being now justified by his blood”: i.e., his atonement.\nEph. 1:7.-“Redemption through his blood”: i.e., through the merits of\nHis atoning death.\nEph. 2:13.-\"But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off\nare made nigh by the blood of Christ’: i.e., by His death, not by His\nlife: yet not by His death alone, but by the atonement made in His\nobedient act in dying for His people.\n\nSo Col. 1:14; Col. 1:20.

Whereas, in chapter 2:1 where it is a question of sin\n(“If any man sin”), the sinful child is reminded, not of the blood, but of\nthe Father, with whom Christ, the righteous One, is the Advocate, to\nshow that relationship has not been broken.\n\nRev. 1:5.-“Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his\nown blood”: i.e., loosed us from our sins by His atonement, which was\naccomplished by His death (reading λύσαντι (/usanti), freed, instead of\nλούσαντι (lousanti), washed, with all the Critical Texts and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] ).\n\nHere note that ἐν (en), whose first meaning is in, must not be so\ntaken here, or in all the parallel passages; we must take it as meaning\nby or through, a meaning which it frequently has: e.g., Mat. 9:34 : “He\ncasteth out devils through (ἐν) the prince of the devils.” Mat. 5:34-35 :\n“Swear not at all, neither by (ἐν) heaven ... nor by (ἐν) the earth.” Gal.\n3:11 : “No man is justified by (ἐν) the law.” 2Ti. 2:10 : “Salvation which\nis in (ἐν) Christ Jesus”: i.e., by or through Him; in virtue of His atoning\ndeath. In this very book (Rev. 5:9), it is rendered “by thy blood.”\n\nSo, here, in Rev. 1:5, it must not be rendered “in his blood,” which\nis not only contrary to Old Testament type (where nothing was ever\nwashed in blood! which would have defiled and made unclean instead\nof cleansing!) but is contrary to the letter as well as the spirit of the\nWord. Rev. 1:5 means washed us or loosed us from our sins by, or in\nvirtue of, through the merits of, His atonement. So Rev. 7:14.\n\nSo that such expressions are to be avoided, as “Washed in the\nblood of the Lamb”; and the sentiment contained in the verse:-\n\n“There is a fountain filled with blood,\n\nDrawn from Immanuel’s veins:\nAnd sinners plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains.”\n\nAll such expressions are contrary to physiology and common\nsense.\n\nWe lose nothing of the facts, but gain immensely as to their\nmeaning, when we understand that, by Metalepsis, “blood” is put for\ndeath, and “death” for the atonement made by it and all its infinite\nmerits.\n\nIn like manner “the Cross” is put first for the crucifixion as an act,\nor for Him who was crucified thereon: and then this is put for the\nresulting merits of His atonements procured thereby.\n\n1Со. 1:17-18.-‘The preaching of the cross.” Paul did not preach the\ncross, nor did he speak merely of the crucifixion (2:2), but of all the\nblessed results, not only of that death, but of the resurrection also.\nGal. 6:14.-“God forbid that | should glory, save in the cross of our Lord\nJesus Christ”: i.e., not the wooden instrument of death, nor the act of\ncrucifixion; but he gloried in all that this meant for him, all the precious\nmerits of Christ’s atonement and the blessings resulting from it.\n\nCol. 1:20.-“And, having made peace through the blood of his cross.”\nHere, again, “cross” is put for His death, and His death is put for all its\nmeritorious results.\n\nIt is by forcing the word “cross” into a literal meaning in such\npassages as the above that the Church of Rome has appeared to\nhave a Scriptural sanction for its reverence for and adoration of “the\ncross.”\nThe reader may easily see where the word “cross” is used literally\nand historically and where it is used figuratively.

Henceforth this\ndistinction was to be done away: and every man (i.e., all to whom the\nSon should reveal the Father, Mat. 11:25-26) would be thus\nenlightened.

That is to say, “Whosoever” fulfils\ncertain conditions: {6., “whosoever” believeth, “whosoever” willeth,\netc. It means all of these without exception, all these as distinct from\nall the others who do not come within the specially described\ncharacters, or correspond with the specified conditions.\n\nIt does not mean all of all kinds indiscriminately without exception,\nbut all without distinction.\n\nThe English word “whosoever” is not always the representative of\nthe same Greek word.\n\nIt is most often used to translate the relative pronoun 6c (hos), he\nwho, and is sometimes followed by ἄν (an), or ἑάν (ean), perchance.\n\nWhen it is not this word, then it represents one of these following:-\nπᾶς (pas), all, every (sometimes with ἄν or ἐάν, perchance).

Domicile is put for prison\nAct. 12:7.-“And a light shone in the building (οἴκημα, oikeema)”: i.e.,\nthe prison, a particular kind of building defined by the context.

Quadrupeds (τετράποδα, tetrapoda) is used for tame or\ndomestic animals\nAct. 10:12.-“Wherein were all manner (Synecdoche of Genus) of four-\nfooted beasts”: {6., tame or domestic animals which are classed off,\nas distinct from “wild beasts” which are also “four-footed.”\n\n9. Statute is put for allowance, or necessary food\nGen. 47:22.-“For the priests had a statute of (or from) Pharaoh, and\ndid eat their statute which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold\nnot their lands”: i.e., they ate, not the statute, but the food assigned to\nthem by one of the statutes which Pharaoh gave them.\nEze. 16:27.-“Behold, therefore, | have stretched out my hand over\nthee and have diminished thy statute”: i.e., the food apportioned to\nthee. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] : “ordinary food.”\nPro. 30:8.-“Feed me with food of my statute”: {6., my statutory food.\nSee A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin.\nJob. 23:12.-“| have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my\nappointed portion”: i.e., my ordinary allowance. The Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] has in the margin, literally, my own law. But\nthe meaning is that the Lord’s word was valued by him more than his\ndaily bread. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] catches the spirit of the words and the\nmeaning of the figure beautifully: “my necessary food.”\n\n10. The Bowels are put for the heart\nPsa. 40:8 (9).-“Thy law is in the midst of my bowels”: i.e., “in my\nheart,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] (but see the margin). Compare verse 10.\n\n11. The Living are put for men\nGen. 3:20.-“And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was\nthe mother of all living”: i.e., of all living beings, or of all people who\nshould live hereafter.\nPsa. 143:2.-“In thy sight will no living ({6., person) be justified.” The\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] inserts the word “man”: e.g., “no man living.”\n12. A Common Name is sometimes put for a proper one\nA name common to many is used of one par excellence: as, when\nGod is called “El,” “The Strong” or “the Mighty One,” it is because,\nthough others are strong, He is stronger than all. Gen. 14:22; Gen.\n21:33. Psa. 5:4 (5); 22:1 (2), etc.\n\nSo Christ is called “the Lord.” Mat. 21:3. Joh. 11:3; Joh. 11:12, etc.\n“The Teacher.” Mat. 22:24. Joh. 11:28. “The Angel.” Gen. 48:16. Exo.\n23:20, or “the Angel of the Lord.” Exo. 3:2. Jdg. 6:11. So Christ is “the\nseed of the woman.” Gen. 3:15. All others are seed of some woman,\nbut Christ is the seed.\n\nMoses is called “the Prophet.” Hos. 12:13 (14). Deu. 34:10-12.\n\nThe Euphrates is called “the river,” because of its magnitude. Gen.\n31:21. Jos. 24:2, where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has “flood.” Psa. 72:8; Psa.\n80:11 (12). Mic. 7:12.\n\nSo the Emperor Nero is called Jord. Act. 25:26.\n\n13. The Plural Number is put for the singular\nThis is not Enallage; because this singular must be and is one of the\nsame kind. As when Sarah said: “Sarah should have given children\nsuck?” Here, though the plural is used, it is used of her only son: as\nshe goes on to say: “for | have born him a son in his old age.” Gen.\n21:7.\nGen. 46:7.-“His daughters”: {6., his one daughter” Dinah.” See verses\n15, 17.\n\nVerse 23: “The sons of Dan, Hushim”: /.е., his one son.* [Note: In\nthese passages there is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss.,\nwhich has the singular number.]\n1Ch. 1:41.-“The sons of Anah; Dishon.”* [Note: In these passages\nthere is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the\nsingular number.]\n\n1Ch. 2:7.-“The sons of Carmi; Achar.”* [Note: In these passages there\nis a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the singular\nnumber.]\n\nVerse 8: “The sons of Etham; Azariah.”* [Note: In these passages\nthere is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the\nsingular number.]\n\nVerse 31: “The sons of Appaim; Ishi. And the sons of Ishi;\nSheshan. And the children of Sheshan; Ahlai.” This Ahlai was a\ndaughter (see verse 34)!\n1Ch. 7:12.-“Hushim, the sons of Aher.”\n2Ch. 24:25.-“For the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest”: i.e.,\nZechariah his son. See verses 20, 21.* [Note: In these passages there\nis a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the singular\nnumber.]\n\nMar. 1:2. Joh. 6:45. Act. 7:42.-The word “prophets” is put for the\nsingular, because in only one prophet is the prophecy “written” (Mal.\n3:1). But the case is different with Mat. 2:23. “That it might be fulfilled\nwhich was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.” A\ndifficulty is created by supposing that Nazarene is from netzer, a\nbranch (a word used of Christ only in Isaiah).\n\nBut apart from the most improbable, if not impossible etymology, it\ndoes not say it was written. It says it was spoken; and who will deny\nthat many prophets may have spoken and prophesied of this Branch?\nSome prophecies were written and not spoken; some were spoken\nand not written; while others were both spoken and written. The same\nexplanation may be given of Mat. 27:9 and Act. 13:40 : where the\npreposition “in” means “by.”\n\nIl. Synecdoche of the Species\nThis is when the Species is put for the Genus (the opposite of the\nabove), or when particulars are put for universals.\n\ni. Many is sometimes put for all\nIsa. 53:12.-“And he bare the sin of many.” Yes, “many,” but for а// His\nown people according to verse 6, Heb. 9:28, and Mat. 1:21.\nDan. 12:2.-“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall\nawake”: i.e., all to whom the prophecy refers. See Joh. 5:28. But\n“avery man in his own order’; or rank and time and according to the\nDispensation.\nRom. 8:29.-“That he might be the first-born among many brethren”:\ni.e., many relatively to others; but 8// with respect to his own brethren.\nJoh. 6:50.-“This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that\nanyone may eat thereof, and not die”: i.e., everyone who does eat of\nit.\nii. Words of a limited and special sense are used with a wider and\nmore universal meaning\n\n1. Man is used for both sexes, men and women\nSee Psa. 1:1; Psa. 32:1; Psa. 112:1. Jer. 17:5; Jer. 17:7, and so\nfrequently as not to need further citation, or to be given in full.\n\n2. One Relationship is put for, and includes others\n\nPsa. 22:4 (5).-“Our fathers trusted in thee”: ᾖθ., all who had lived\nbefore them and trusted in God are included.\nPsa. 106:6.-“We have sinned with our fathers”: i.e., with all who have\ngone before.\n\n2Sa. 9:7.-“And David said unto him, Fear not, for | will surely show\nthee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all\nthe land of Saul thy father”: i.e., thy grandfather.\n\n2Sa. 19:28.-Mephibosheth said to David, “All of my father’s house\nwere but dead men before my lord the king”: he means his father’s\nfather.\nDan. 5:2; Dan. 5:11.-In verse 18 Daniel, speaking to Belshazzar, calls\nNebuchadnezzar (by Synecdoché) his father, whereas he was his\ngrandfather. See the margin of verse 2, 11. Daniel made no mistake,\nbut he makes use of a common and well known figure of speech.\n1Ki. 15:10; 1Ki. 15:13.-Asa’s grandmother is called his “mother.” See\nmargin of verse 10.\nJdg. 9:1.-“Brethren’ is put for other relations. So also\nGen. 13:8; Gen. 31:23; 1Ch. 12:29, where it is rendered “kindred.”\nSee margin.\nJerome classifies four kinds of “brethren”:-“brethren” by\n\n1. Nature. Gen. 27:1.\n\n2. Nation. Deu. 15:3.\n\n3. Kindred. Gen. 13:8.\n\n4. Affection. Psa. 133:1, etc., etc.\nExo. 1:7.-“Sons” are put for posterity. So also Jer. 31:29.\nGen. 29:5.-Laban the “son” of Nahor is put for his grandson.\nGen. 24:48.-Rebecca called Abraham\'s “brother’s daughter,” when\nshe was the daughter of Bethuel and granddaughter of Nahor, not of\nAbraham.\n2Sa. 19:24.-Mephibosheth is called “the son of Saul.” “Son” is here\nput (by Synecdoché) for his grandson.\nJos. 7:24.-Achan is called “the son of Zerah,” which is put for great\ngrandson. See verse 1. So\nMat. 1:1.-Christ is called “the Son of David” in a like way. The word\n“son” being used in a wide signification. So Mat. 9:27; Mat. 12:23; Mat.\n15:22; Mat. 20:30-31; Mat. 21:9; Mat. 21:15; Mat. 22:42. Mar. 12:35.\nLuk. 18:38-39. Compare Rom. 1:3. 2Ti. 2:8. Rev. 22:16.\n\nHence David is called his father (Luk. 1:32).\n\nZacchzeus is in the same way called a “son of Abraham” (Luk.\n19:9). Compare Luk. 13:16.\n\nAll the Jews called Abraham their “father” (Luk. 1:73. Joh. 8:39,\nsee verse 56. Act. 7:2. Rom. 4:1).\n\nThe Samaritans called Jacob their “father” (Joh. 4:12).\n\niii. A proper name is put for a common; an individual is put for many;\nand the particular is put for the universal\n\nIsa. 63:16.-“Thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,\nand Israel acknowledge us not.”\n\nHere, the individuals are put for the great majority of the People of\nIsrael. For the patriarchs named were long since dead.\n1Co. 3:6.-“Apollos” is put for any minister.\n1Со. 7:16.-“Wife” and “man” are put for all wives and all husbands.\n\niv. A species of a thing is put for the whole genus\n1. Bow, Spear, etc., are put for all kinds of arms\n\nPsa. 44:6 (7).-“I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save\nme”: i.e., | will not trust in any weapons or in any human means of\ndefence, but in God alone, see verse 7 (8). This may be also\nMetonymy of the adjunct. So Zec. 10:4.\nPsa. 46:9 (10).-“He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth:\nhe breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the\nchariot in the fire”: i.e., if all wars are to cease, all kinds of implements\nof war must be included and represented in the few species named.\n2. The Ass is put for all kinds of animals not sacrificed\nExo. 13:13.-“And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a\nlamb.” The firstborn of all unclean beasts, which might not be\nsacrificed, had to be redeemed (see Num. 18:15), but only one\nspecies is named here, and in 34:20.\n3. Gold is put for gifts\nPsa. 72:15.-“To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.” Here, the\nprincipal gift is put for all other kinds of gifts. See Isa. 60:5-7.\n4. Stones are put for whatever is hurtful to the soil\nJob. 5:23.-“For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and\nthe beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.”\n5. Lion is put for all kinds of wild beasts\nIsa. 15:9.-“I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth\nof Moab.”\n6. Commandment is put for all commandments and doctrines\n2Pe. 2:21.-“It had been better for them not to have known the way of\nrighteousness, than, after they had known it, to turn from the holy\ncommandment delivered unto them.” So chap. 3:2.\n7. Honey is put for whatever is sweet and delicious\nExo. 3:8; Exo. 3:17.-“A land flowing with milk and honey”: i.e., filled\nwith all satisfying and delightful things, sweet and good: i.e., a region\nirrigated and fruitful, abounding with pasture and fruits of all kinds. See\nExo. 13:5; Exo. 33:3. Lev. 20:24. Num. 13:27; Num. 14:8; Num. 16:13.\nDeu. 6:3; Deu. 11:9; Deu. 26:9; Deu. 26:15; Deu. 27:3; Deu. 31:20.\nJos. 5:6. Jer. 11:5; Jer. 32:22. Eze. 20:6; Eze. 20:15.\nSometimes “oil” is added, or “figs,” etc. Deu. 8:8; Deu. 32:13. 2Ki.\n18:32. Eze. 16:13; Eze. 16:19.\nSometimes “butter.” Job. 20:17.\n8. Bread is put for all kinds of food, including fish\nIt is often translated “food.” Gen. 3:19; Gen. 18:5; Gen. 39:6; Gen.\n43:25; Gen. 43:31; Gen. 49:20. Lev. 3:11 (food); 21:6, * [Note: “Bread\nof thy God”: i.e., food which God gives.] 8.* [Note: “Bread of thy God”:\n1.8., food which God gives.] Num. 28:2. Jdg. 13:16. 1Sa. 14:24 (food);\n20:27 (meat); 28:20. Job. 6:7 (meat); 20:14 (meat); Psa. 41:9 (10):\n102:4 (5); 136:25; 146:7. Ecc. 9:11; Ecc. 10:19 (feast). Isa. 3:1; Isa.\n58:7. Jer. 52:33; Dan. 5:1 (feast). Hos. 9:4. Mal. 1:7. Mat. 6:11; Mat.\n15:2; Mat. 15:26. Luk. 14:1 : etc., etc.\n\nHence to “break bread” or to “eat bread” means to partake of a\nmeal. It is the common Hebrew idiom to this day. Just as among the\nArabs, “salt” (one particular and important kind of food) is put\nuniversally for the whole meal and for all kinds of food, and “to take\nsalt” with anyone means to partake of his hospitality. So “to break\nbread” means not to partake of the Lord’s supper, but to partake of an\nordinary meal with others. By Synecdoche “bread” (one kind of food)\nis put for all kinds of food (or meat), and the breaking of it is merely\nequivalent to carving or cutting it up. See under /diom.\n\nWhen “water” is added ({6., “bread and water’), it is meant to\ninclude all kinds of solid and liquid food necessary to eat and to drink.\nSee Isa. 3:1; Isa. 33:16, etc.\n\n9. Peace is used for plenty, and happiness; and of all kinds of\nearthly good and blessing\nGen. 43:23.-“Peace be to you”: i.e., peace and all blessings.\nNum. 6:26.-“The Lord ... give thee peace.”\nPsa. 119:165.-“Great peace (i.e., every blessing) have they which love\nthy law.”\nRom. 2:10.-“But glory, honour, and peace (i.e., every earthly blessing)\nto every man that worketh good,” etc. See this passage under the\nfigure of Ellipsis. So also Jam. 3:18.\n\nPeace is also used of all heavenly and spiritual blessing\nIsa. 57:19.-“I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to him that is far\noff,” etc. See under Epizeuxis.\nJoh. 14:27.-“Peace | leave with you, my peace | give unto you”: i.e.,\nnot peace alone, which is only one species of heavenly gifts, but all\nkinds of blessings. So Joh. 20:19; Joh. 20:21; Joh. 20:26.\nRom. 1:7.-“Grace to you, and peace.”\nRom. 5:1.-“Therefore having been justified by faith (ἐκ πίστεως, ek\nρἰδίεφς, on faith-principle, as opposed to /aw-principle) we have\npeace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ’; and with it every\nheavenly blessing, as verse 2 goes on to show: “By whom we have\nobtained access also by faith into this grace wherein we stand.” So\nalso Rom. 14:17, etc., etc.\n10. Prey (C/O, that which is taken in hunting: .e., one kind of\nfood) is put for any and all kinds of food\nPsa. 111:5.-“He hath given prey (so margin: i.e., meat) unto them that\nfear him”: i.e., those who fear God will not have to hunt in vain for their\nfood! He will give it to them. See Psa. 147:9.\nPro. 31:15.-“She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth prey to her\nhousehold”: {6., finds and prepares their food.\nMal. 3:10.-“Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may\nbe prey in mine house.”\n\n11. Blood (Heb. often Bloods) is put for murder or cruelty; or\n\ndeath generally\n\nDeu. 19:12.-“The avenger of blood”: i.e., murder.\nPsa. 9:12 (13).-“When He maketh inquisition for blood”: i.e. for the\nshedding of blood.\n\nSo Hos. 1:4; Hos. 4:2. Mat. 23:35; Mat. 27:24.\n\n12. Blood is also put for guilt\n\nLev. 20:9.-“His blood shall be upon him”: i.e., his guilt or punishment,\netc., etc.\nDeu. 19:10.-“And so blood (i.e., guilt) be not upon him.”\nDeu. 21:8.-“And the blood (i.e., the guilt) shall be forgiven them.” So in\nthe next verse the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] actually supplies the words: “So shalt thou\nput away the guilt of innocent blood from among you.”\n2Ki. 24:4.-“He filled Jerusalem with innocent blood.” “Blood” (i.e.,\nmurder and the guilt of it) is here put as the gravest sin, for all the\nother kinds of sins which Jehoiakim committed in Jerusalem.\nPsa. 51:14 (16).-“Deliver me from bloods, О God”: ᾖ8., (as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] ), “from blood-guiltiness.”\nIsa. 1:15.-“Your hands are full of blood”: i.e., of murders and blood-\nguiltiness.\n\n13. Clothing is put for all necessary things\nIsa. 3:6.-“When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of\nhis father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler”: i.e., thou art\nwell dressed and therefore hast other good things beside.\n14. Widows and Fatherless are put for all kinds of afflicted\nExo. 22:21.-“Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.” Surely\nit does not follow that they might afflict all others. No! one kind or class\nis put for all similar kinds of helpless people.\n\nDeu. 10:18.-“He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and\nwidow.”\n\nDeu. 27:19.-“Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the\nstranger, fatherless, and widow.” So also Psa. 146:9. Pro. 23:10. Isa.\n1:17; Isa. 1:23. Jer. 7:6; Jer. 22:3. Eze. 22:7.\n\nJam. 1:27.-“pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is\nthis, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,” etc.: i.e., all in\ndistress or trouble of any kind. This refers to “religion” which in itself is\nnothing. All who are “in Christ” will surely manifest such evidence as\nthis and much more. But for those not “in Christ,” all the visiting of all\nthe widows and fatherless in the world will never accomplish the\nstupendous miracle of Divine grace; for we are saved by grace and\nnot by works.\nv. Verbs having a special meaning are used in a more general\nsense\n\n1. “To Ascend” is used for to come, or to enter into the thoughts,\nor the mind\n\n2Ki. 12:4.-“All the money that ascendeth upon the heart of a man”:\n\nie., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] , “that cometh into any man’s heart” ({6.,\n\nthoughts, his thoughts or mind).\n\nJer. 7:31.-“To burn their sons and daughters in the fire; which |\n\ncommanded them not, neither did it ascend upon my heart”: i.e., come\n\ninto my mind.\n\nEze. 38:10.-“At the same time shall things ascend upon thine heart”:\n\nie., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] , come into thy mind.\n1Co. 2:9.-“Neither have ascended upon the heart of man”: i.e., as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , “Neither have entered into the heart of man.” Here the\nidiom is Hebrew, though the language is Greek.\n\n2. To Make (with time) is used for to continue or abide\nAct. 15:33.-“And, having made a time, they were let go”: i.e., as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , “After they had tarried there a space.”\nAct. 18:23.-“And having made or done some time, he departed”: {6.,\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , “After he had spent some time there.”\nAct. 20:3.-“And having done three months there”: {6., as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\n“And there abode three months.”\n2Co. 11:25.-“A night and a day have | done or made in the deep”: {6.,\n| have passed or been in the deep.\nJam. 4:13.-“Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we shall go\ninto such a city, and shall do a year there”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\ncontinue there a year.\n\nSo Latin agere vitam (to live), and agere poenitentiam (to repent)\nwhich Rome, translating literally in all her versions, renders “do\npenance.”\n\n3. To go out and come in is used of official actions or of life in\ngeneral\nNum. 27:16-17.-“... set a man over the congregation, Which may go\nout before them, and which may go in before them, and which may\nlead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of\nthe Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.”\n\nSo verse 21. 2Ch. 1:10. Psa. 121:8. Isa. 37:28. Joh. 10:9. Act.\n\n1:21.\n4. To find is used for to receive, to obtain\nGen. 6:8.-“Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord”: i.e., received\ngrace from the Lord.\nGen. 26:12.-“Then Isaac sowed in that land, and found (i.e., received,\n\nas A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\n\nBible, 1611.] , see margin) in the same year an hundredfold: and the\n\nLord blessed him.”\n\nLuk. 1:30.-“Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with (ie.,\n\nreceived grace from) God.”\n\nRom. 4:1.-“What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as\n\npertaining to the flesh, hath found?” {6., received or obtained.\n\nHeb. 9:12.-“By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,\n\nhaving found (i.e., obtained, as in A.V.

To find is also used of to have, or to be present with\n\n1Sa. 13:15.-“And Saul numbered the people that were found (i.e.,\n\nwere present) with him, about six hundred men.”\n\nLuk. 9:36.-“And when the voice was past Jesus was found (i.e., was\n\npresent) alone.”\n\nRom. 7:18.-“For | know that in me (that is, in my flesh) there does not\n\ndwell any good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform\nthat which is good | find not (i.e., is not present with me).”\nPhp. 2:8.-“And being found (i.e., present) in fashion as a man he\nhumbled himself.”\nPhp. 3:9.-“And be found (i.e., be present) in him.”\nHeb. 11:5.-“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see\ndeath; and was not found (i.e., present), because God had translated\nhim.”\n\n6. To call upon the Lord is used of Divine worship\nA special act is put for the general act of worship.\nGen. 4:26.-“Then began men to call upon (i.e., to worship) the name\nof the Lord”: i.e., Jehovah. See under Metonymy.\nIsa. 43:22.-“But thou hast not called upon me ({6., worshipped me), ©\nJacob.”\nSo the Greek προσκυνέω (proskuneq), to do homage by kissing\nthe hand, the general word for reverence is put for the special act of\nworship.\n\nJoh. 4:23-24.-“The hour is coming and now is, when the true\nworshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father\nseeketh such to worship him.

To Meet (καταντάω, katantaq) is used of arriving at so as to\ntouch\n\nAct. 16:1.-“Then came he to (/е., and he arrived at) Derbe and\nLystra,” etc.\nEph. 4:13.-‘Till we shall all have come into ({6., arrived at) the unity of\nthe faith,” etc.\nPhp. 3:11.-“If by any means | might attain unto (i.e., arrive at) the out-\nrising, that one from among the dead.”* [Note:“ucticlms о αἡ &\nΒραιιῶ «i ἓ ἠσῶ. LTTr.WH. and R.V. read с & for αῶ, as rendered\nabove.] Paul is saying this from his point of view as a Jew, and not\nthat of a saint. He is speaking of what he formerly counted as his\ngains (verse 7), and which he now “counted loss for the knowledge of\nChrist ... that | may be found in him ... that | may know him ... if by\nany means | might arrive at the out-rising from among the dead.”\n\nThis was not spoken as a Christian, as though he might attain\nsomething that other Christians could not attain; but it was spoken as\na Jew, that he might attain (in Christ) a resurrection from among the\ndead, which other Jews could not hope for. The Jews looked for a\nresurrection, but it was only τῶν νεκρῶν (fqn nekropn), of dead\npersons, while Paul was willing to give up this and all his other\nsupposed “gains” for the blessed hope of an out-rising, ἐκ τῶν νεκρων.\n(ek фп nekropn), from among the dead.\n1Th. 4:17.-“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught away\ntogether with them in clouds for a meeting of the Lord, into the air, and\nthus, always with the Lord shall we be.”\n\nHere, the meeting involves actual arrival at the meeting-place of\nthe Lord, and actual presence there with him.\n\n10. To Drink is used of partaking of food and drink of all kinds\n1Co. 3:2.-“I gave you milk to drink and not meat”: {6., as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , 1\nhave fed you. See under Zeugma.\n\n11. To Answer, or Open the Mouth is put for speaking\nJob. 3:1.-“After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day”: i.e.,\nJob said, etc.\nPsa. 119:172.-“My tongue shall respond to thy word”: {6., speak of it,\nas in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.]\nAnd so, very frequently, this Hebrew idiom is used in the New\nTestament.\nMat. 11:25.-“At that time Jesus answered ({6., spake), and said: |\nthank Thee Father, ... Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy\nsight.” Thus our attention is called to what He said; for the answer was\nto the circumstances of “that time.” What were they? John had\nquestioned (verses 2-6). The people had spurned both John and\nHimself (16-19). His mighty works had been fruitless (20-24). And,\nthen, “at that time,” when all seemed to end in failure, the Lord Jesus\nfound rest in submission and resignation to the Father’s will, and,\nthen, turning to all His servants-“weary and heavy laden” with their\nburden and toil-He graciously invites them to find rest where He had\nfound it, saying: “Come unto me ... and | will give you rest. Take my\nyoke upon you, and learn of me; ... and ye shall find rest.”\n\nMar. 11:14.-“And Jesus answered and said unto it” (the fig-tree, which\nhad not spoken), i.e., spake and said.\n\nSo Luk. 7:40, etc.\n\n12. To Sit is used of a permanent condition in which one is placed\nIsa. 42:7.-“Them that sit in darkness,” quoted in Mat. 4:16.\n\nAct. 18:11.-“And he sat there a year and six months teaching the word\nof God among them”: i.e., he continued there, but the verb “sat” is\nused in order to be in harmony with his act of teaching. See under\nMetonymy.\n\n13. To Sit Down and Rise Up is used for all the ordinary acts of\n\nlife which come between them\nPsa. 139:2.-“Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising.”\n14. To Come, ат (bq), ἔρχεσθαι (erchesthai), is used of going as\nwell as coming\n\nJon. 1:3.-“But Jonah ... found a ship coming ({6., going) to Tarshish.”\nMar. 16:2.-“They came (i.e., went) unto the sepulchre.”\nJoh. 6:17.-“And (they) entered into a ship, and came ({6., went) over\nthe sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not\ncome ({6., gone) to them.\nJoh. 11:29.-“As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came\n(i.e., went) unto him.”\nAct. 28:17.-“And so we came (i.e., went, as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] )\ntowards Rome.”\n\nRev. 6:1; Rev. 6:3; Rev. 6:5; Rev. 6:7.-In these verses, the verb “and\n\nsee” goes out, according to the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n\n1881.] and all the Critical Texts. In this case the verb “come” is used\n\nin the sense of “go,” as a command from the throne to the horsemen,\n\ne.g., “| heard as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living\n\ncreatures, saying, Go! and | saw and behold a white horse ... and he\n\nwent forth.” So in each of the other cases.\n\nvi. One example or specimen is put for all kinds of similar things\n1. In human actions\n\nDeu. 19:5.-One kind of homicide is mentioned as an example of every\n\nkind.\n\nPsa. 112:5.-“Lending” is put as one kind of favour which a good man\n\nsheweth. The most rare is given as an example of all kinds of merciful\n\nworks.\n\nPro. 20:10.-“Divers ephahs” are put for all kinds of measures.\n\nPro. 27:14.-“Blessing” a friend with a loud voice, is put for all kinds of\n\nflattery.\nJer. 15:10.-“Lending on usury” is put for all kinds of business\ntransactions and contracts which are liable to gender strife.\n\nZec. 5:3.-“Stealing” and “swearing’-two of the commonest kinds of\nsin-are put for other kinds.\n\nMat. 5:22.-“Raca’ is put for all kinds of opprobrious terms, etc.\n\nMat. 6:1.-“Take heed that ye do not your righteousness.”\n\nThe figure here led to an early corruption of the text. One kind of\nrighteous acts, alms-giving, is put for all kinds. Hence ἐλεημοσύνην\n(eléeemosuneen), alms, was put for δικαιοσύνην (dikaiosuneen),\nrighteousness.\nMat. 6:5.-Ргауег is only one of many things which are not to be done\nas the hypocrites do them.\nMat. 6:16.-So with fasting.\nMar. 11:23.-Removing mountains-one kind of impossible thing, is put\nfor all kinds that are “impossible with men.” So Luk. 17:6. Mat. 17:20 :\nin which latter place the word “nothing” shows that removing\nmountains is only one of a class of impossibilities. It is not in the\nnature of things for a word to pluck up a mountain. See 1Co. 13:2.\nJob. 9:5.-“Which removeth mountains, and they know not.” This is\nonly one kind of things which are possible with God, though\nimpossible with men (Luk. 18:27).\nHeb. 13:9.-“It is a good thing that the heart to be established with\ngrace, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been\noccupied therein.” Here “meats,” one of the things about which people\nare occupied, is put for all kinds of divers and strange doctrines which\ndo not profit those who are occupied with them.\n\n2. In Divine Precepts, etc.\nExo. 20:12.-“Honour thy father and thy mother’: i.e., all who stand in\nthe place of parents.\nExo. 23:4.-The “ox and ass” are mentioned only as examples, for\nsurely a horse, or camel, or child, etc., would be included in the\ncommand.\nPro. 25:21. Rom. 12:20.-Surely the two things mentioned are only\nexamples of many ways in which love may be shown to our enemies.\nLuk. 3:11.-One kind of vestment is put for any kind.\n1Ti. 6:8.-“Food and raiment” are put by example for this world’s\ngoods. See 1.)п. 3:17.\nJoh. 13:14.-“Washing the feet” is only one kind or one example of\nhumble service which one may do for another. So 1Sa. 25:41. 1Ti.\n5:10.\n\nIll. Synecdoche of the Whole\nSynecdoche of the whole is when the whole is put for a part. This is a\ncloser connection than that of mere genus or species. It is when the\none is not merely of the same kind as the other, but actually a part or\nmember of it.\ni. The whole is put for every part of it\nNum. 16:3.-“Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation\nare holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them”: i.e., the\nwhole congregation having been separated to the Lord from the other\nnations, each person was also included.\n1К!. 6:22.-“The whole house he overlaid with gold”: and therefore\nevery part of it.\nMat. 3:5.-“Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all (πᾶσα, pasa)\nJudzea, and all the region round about Jordan:” the words Jerusalem,\nJudaea, and region, being used by Synecdoché of the genus for the\npeople in them. The word “all” is literal, and means the whole as\nincluding every part. So that “all Judaza” means people from every\npart of Judzea. So Mar. 1:5. Act. 1:8.\nMat. 27:45.-“There was darkness over all the land (ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,\nepi pasan teen geen)”: i.e., the whole Land, as in Mar. 15:33 (ὅλην,\nholeen).\nEph. 2:21.-“In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth\nunto an holy temple in the Lord”: i.e., the whole building; πᾶσα (pasa),\nevery being put for every part of it.\nEph. 3:15.-“Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.”\nHere, the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has rendered the\nfigure literally “every family,” which is not sense, but in the margin has\nput “Gr. fatherhood.” “Every” here is used for “the whole,” and means\nevery part or member of the whole: i.e., the whole family as made up\nof every principality, and power, and angel, and archangel “in heaven”\n(verse 10), and of Israel and the Church on earth. All are of or from\none Creator and Source (Heb. 2:11). See Ellipsis.\nCol. 2:9.-“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily”:\nlit, every: i.e., every part of, meaning the whole fulness of the\nGodhead in bodily form.\n\n2Ti. 3:16.-“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God”: {6., the whole\nScripture; not “every Scripture,” as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] , but every part of Scripture. See under Ellipsis, page\n44.\n\nAct. 4:10.-“Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel”: {6.,\nthe whole of Israel.\n\nRom. 4:16.-“To the end the promise might be sure to all the seed”:\nie., the whole seed.\n\n2Th. 1:10.-“When He shall have come (ἔλθῃ, e/thee) to be glorified in\nhis saints, and to be admired in all them that believe ... in that day”:\ni.e., the whole body of believers.\n\nIn like manner “every” (i.e., “all”) is used for the whole in Mat.\n26:59. Mar. 1:33; Mar. 14:55. Act. 2:47; Act. 7:10; Act. 15:22. Php.\n1:13.\n\nii. The Collective is put for the particular\nWhat is said of the whole, collectively, is sometimes said (by\nSynecdoche) only of a part; and not of all the parts, precisely and\nsingularly.\n\nGen. 6:12.-“All flesh.” This did not include Noah. See verse 9.\n\nGen. 35:26.-“These are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in\nPadan-Aram.” This does not include Benjamin. See verses 24 and 16.\nMat. 19:28.-“Ye which have followed me ... when the Son of man shall\nsit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,\njudging the twelve tribes of Israel.” The “ye” does not include Judas\nIscariot.\n\nHeb. 11:13.-“These all died in faith.” This does not include Enoch (see\nverse 5), but only all who died.\n\n1Co. 15:22.-“For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be\nmade alive.” But all will not die (see verse 51). Those who are “alive\nand remain” to the coming of the Lord will not die at all, but be\nchanged. Therefore it means-that, as, in Adam, all who are in him die,\nso in Christ also, all who are in Him shall be made alive. The “all” in\nthe first clause clearly does not include the all who shall be “alive and\nremain,” and cannot therefore include the “all” in the second clause.\niii. The whole is put for one of its parts\nGen. 8:13.-“And Noah removed the covering of the ark,” i.e., not the\nwhole roof, but the covering of the aperture which was made in it as a\npart of it: see 6:16.\nExo. 22:13.-‘If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it (i.e., one of the\npieces) for witness.”\n1Sa. 5:4.-“And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold,\nDagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the\nLord; and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were\ncut off upon the threshold: only Dagon was left to him, i.e., only the\nbody was left. So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] puts in italics “only the stump of\nDagon was left.”\nPsa. 102:5 (6).-“My bones cleave to my flesh,” i.e., “my skin,” as in\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] , see margin.\n1Sa. 19:24.-“Naked” for scantily clad. So also Isa. 20:2-3. Mic. 1:8.\nJoh. 21:7. Job. 22:6; Job. 24:10. Mat. 25:36; Mat. 25:43. Jam. 2:15.\n10ο. 4:11. In all these cases “naked” is put for being scantily clothed,\nor poorly clad.\nAct. 27:33.-“And continued fasting.” Fasting, the whole, is put for the\npart; i.e., from real nourishment, or regular meals.\niv. A place is put for a part of it\n1. The World is put for persons in all parts of it\nJoh. 3:16.-“God so loved the world”: ᾖθ., people and kindred and\ntongues in all parts of the world. Not, as heretofore, only Israel. This\nlove was confined to Israel, according to Deu. 33:3 : “Yea, he loved\nthe people”: i.e., Israel (chap. 7:6-8, etc.). But now His love was to go\nout beyond Israel to people of all nations of the world, without any\nsuch distinction. It is not the world without exception, but without\ndistinction.\nJoh. 12:19.-“Behold, the world is gone after him”: i.e., multitudes of\npeople of all sorts. Synecdoche here is preferable to Hyperbole (q.v.\n[Note: Which 5εε.]).\nRom. 1:8.-“Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world”: i.e., in\nall parts of the world.\n1Jn. 2:2.-“Not for ours only, but also for the whole world”: i.e., for all\npeople; without distinction. See Metonymy of the Subject.\n\n2. “The World” is put for a primary part of it\nIsa. 13:11.-“And | will punish the world for their evil”: i.e., Babylon (see\nverse 1). So Isa. 14:17.\nLuk. 2:1.-“There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the\nworld (i.e., the civilised world, or Roman Empire) should be taxed.”\n\n3. All the Earth is put for the greater part of its inhabitants\nGen. 41:57.-“In all lands”: i.e., in many neighbouring countries.\n2Sa. 15:23.-“All the country”: i.e., all the country round him.\nIsa. 13:5.-“The whole land”: i.e., all the land of Chaldeea.\n\n4. The Earth is put for the land of Judcea\nHos. 1:2.-Rendered “land.” Hos. 4:1. Joe. 1:2, etc.\n5. The Land (γῆ) is put for city\nMat. 2:6.-“And thou, Bethlehem, land (i.e., city) of Juda.” Not seeing\nthe figure, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] interpolates the word “in” in italics.\n6. The East is put for Persia, Media, and other countries east of\nJerusalem\nEze. 25:4. 1Ki. 4:30. Isa. 2:6. Mat. 2:1, etc.\n7. The South is put for Egypt, with respect to Palestine\nJer. 13:19. Dan. 11:5, etc.\n8. The South is put for the Negev, or the hill country of Judea,\nwith respect to Jerusalem\nGen. 12:9; Gen. 13:1; Gen. 13:3. Eze. 20:46-47.\n9. The North is put for Chaldoea and its chief city Babylon,\nbecause all armies from beyond the Euphrates crossed high up\nand entered Palestine from the North\nJer. 1:13-15; Jer. 13:20; Jer. 47:2. Zep. 2:13.\n10. The North is put for Media and Persia, with respect to\nBabylon\nJer. 6:1 (compare 51:11 and 27, 28); 50:3, 41.\n11. The Temple is put for certain of the parts comprehended in it\nLuk. 2:46. Joh. 18:20.\nv. Time is put for a portion of time\n\nénéi (ohlam), for ever, used in various limited significations.\n\nExo. 21:6.-“And he shall serve him for ever”: i.e., as long as he lives.\nSo Deu. 15:17, and Philem. 15.\n\nLev. 25:46.-“They shall be your bondmen for ever”: {6., as long as\nthey live.\n\n1Sa. 1:22.-“That he (Samuel) may appear before the Lord, and there\nabide for ever”: {6., as long as he lives.\n\n1Ch. 15:2.-“For them (the Levites) hath the Lord chosen to carry the\nark of God, and to minister unto him for ever’: i.e., without change.\n2Sa. 12:10.-“Now therefore the sword shall never (it, not for ever)\ndepart from thine house”: i.e., while David or his family lived.\nJer. 5:15.-The Babylonians are called “a nation from eternity”: i.e.,\nvery ancient (compare Gen. 10:10).\nJer. 17:4.-“Ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for\never”: {68., until all is consumed.\nJer. 25:9.-“Eternal desolations.” Here it is rendered “perpetual” to\nsoften it down, as the period is distinctly defined in verse 11 to be\n“seventy years.” After which Babylon is to become eternal desolation\n(verse 12), until it shall be rebuilt according to many prophecies.\nVerses 9 and 12 clearly mean, therefore, that the desolations shall be\ncomplete and continuous during the whole period referred to.\nDan. 2:4; Dan. 6:21 (22), etc.-“O King, live for ever”: i.e., a long time:\nas we say, “Long live the king.”\n\nSo in Luk. 20:9, “a long (a sufficient) time” (χρόνος, chronos): i.e.,\na year; till the next season.\n\nIV. Synecdoche of the Part\n\nSynecdoche of the Part is when a part is put for the whole. The\nconnection between the part and the whole is closer also than that\nbetween the species and the genus; inasmuch as the part is actually a\nmember of the whole, and not merely a species or specimen of it.\n\nIn Synecdoche of the Part, one part or member is put for, and\nincludes, every part or member.\ni. An integral part of man (individually) is put for the whole man\n1. The Soul (dou, nephesh, and ψυχή, psychee) is put for the\nwhole person\nGen. 12:5.-“The souls ({6., the persons) that they had gotten in\n\nHaran.”\n\nGen. 14:21.-“And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the\nsouls ({6., the persons) and take the goods to thyself.”\n\nGen. 17:14.-“That soul (i.e., that person) shall be cut off from his\npeople.”\n\nSo Gen. 46:15; Gen. 46:26-27. Exo. 12:19; Exo. 16:16 (marg.\n[Note: arg. Margin.] ) Lev. 5:2; Lev. 5:4. Jos. 20:3. Eze. 18:4; Eze.\n18:20. Act. 2:41; Act. 2:43; Act. 7:14. Rom. 13:1. 1Pe. 3:20. Luk. 6:9,\n“to save a soul”: {6., a man.\n\nIn this sense we must take Rev. 6:9; Rev. 20:4 : “the souls of them\nthat were slain or beheaded”: i.e., the persons. John saw the dead\npersons. They could not reign till they were made alive, hence in 20:4,\nwe read that “they lived.” Moreover, how could “souls” cry “How long?”\nor, as such, wear “white robes,” which “were given unto every one of\nthem” (6:11)?\n2. The expression My Soul, His Soul, etc., becomes by Synecdoché\nthe idiom for me, myself, himself, etc. See under Idiom.\n\nNum. 23:10.-“Let my soul die the death of the righteous”: i.e., let me\ndie, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] See the margin.\nJdg. 16:30.-“And Samson said, Let my soul (/е., me, as in A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\nsee margin) die with the Philistines.”\nJob. 36:14.-“Their soul dieth (i.e., they die, as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) in\nyouth.”\nPsa. 3:2 (3).-“Many there be which say of my soul (i.e., of me), There\nis no help for him in his God.” So Psa. 11:1.\nPsa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e., me) in Hades”: i.e., the\ngrave.\nPsa. 25:13.-“His soul (i.e., he) shall dwell at ease.”\nPsa. 35:13.-“I humbled my soul (i.e., myself) with fasting.”\nPsa. 103:1.-“Bless the Lord, О my soul”: {6., О myself. So in verses 2,\n22, and Psa. 104:1; Psa. 104:35.\nIsa. 57:5.-“Is it such a fast that | have chosen? a day for a man to\nafflict his soul?” /.e., himself.\n\nLuk. 12:19.-“I will say to my soul”: i.e., myself, etc.\n\nAct. 2:31.-“His soul ({6., He) was not left in Hades (the grave), neither\nhis flesh did see corruption.”\n\nRom. 16:4.-“Who have for my soul (A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , life) laid down\ntheir own necks”: {6., who have laid down their own necks for me.\n1Pe. 1:9.-“Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your\nsouls”: i.e., of yourselves.\n\n3. Soul (dou, nephesh) is also used of animals;\nand when joined with the word “living” (khayah), means “living\ncreature,” as translated in Gen. 1:20-21; Gen. 1:24; Gen. 1:30. So\nalso Rev. 16:3, as well as of man in Gen. 2:7, where it is rendered\n“living soul.”\n\n4. The Body is put for the person himself\n\nJust as we say, “a hand” for a workman.\nExo. 21:3.-‘If he (i.e., the Hebrew servant) came in with his body (i.e.,\nby himself, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] )”: /е., alone, without a wife, as the rest of\nthe verse explains it.\nRom. 12:1.-“I beseech you therefore ... that ye present your bodies\n(i.e., yourselves) a living sacrifice,” etc.\n1Co. 6:15.-“Know ye not that your bodies (i.e., ye) are the members of\nChrist?”\nJam. 3:6.-“So is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the\nwhole body”: i.e., the whole being.\n\n5. The Flesh, an integral part of man, is put for the whole\nGen. 17:13.-“My covenant shall be in your flesh”: i.e., in your body, on\nyour person.\n\nPsa. 16:9.-“My flesh also shall rest in hope”: i.e., my body will rest in\nhope. See Act. 2:26-31.\nPro. 14:30.-“A sound heart is the life of the flesh”: {6., of the body.\n2Co. 7:1.-“Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh ({6.,\nof the body) and spirit.”\n\n6. The Flesh is put for the whole person\nGen. 6:12.-“All flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” Here\n“flesh,” being the figure for people, the word “all” is literal: {6., all\npeople, every person. But even this excepts Noah. See above.\nPsa. 56:4 (5).-“I will not fear what flesh (i.e., man) can do unto me.”\nSee verse 11 (12).\n\nPsa. 65:2 (3)-“O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh\ncome”: i.e., all people.\n\nPsa. 145:21.-“Let all flesh ({6., let all people) bless his holy name for\never’: /it., “all flesh shall bless,” as in verse 10.\n\nIsa. 40:5.-“The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh (i.e.,\nall people) shall see it together.” See Luk. 3:6.\n\nIsa. 40:6.-“All flesh is grass.” See Metaphor.\n\nMat. 19:5.-“And they twain shall be one flesh”: {6., one person, not a\nsoulless body!\n\nJoh. 6:51.-“My flesh”: i.e., myself.\n\nRom. 3:20.-“By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh (i.e., not a\nsingle person) be justified.” Here, the “flesh” being figurative, the\nnegative denies literally. So\n\n1Со. 1:29.-“That no flesh (i.e., not a single person) should glory in his\npresence.”\n\n1Pe. 1:24.-“All flesh (/.€., every one) is as grass.”\n7. Flesh is put for the whole, and true, humanity of Christ\nJoh. 1:14.-“The Word was made flesh”: {6., man, a human being.\nJoh. 6:51-56.-Here, “flesh” and “blood,” (see below) are jointly as well\nas severally put for humanity as distinct from Divinity. There are other\nfigures in this passage; but the word “flesh” is put, not for the “body” of\nChrist, but for Himself in His true humanity.\n1Ti. 3:16.-“Manifest in the flesh”: {6., in human beings. The “mystery”\nwas manifest. The reading 6 (ho), which, corresponds best with the\ncontext, and agrees with the neuter word Мистйрюм, mystery. This\nmystery is Christ Mystical (not personal): i.e., Christ the head of the\nBody in glory and His members here upon earth. Otherwise the last\nthree facts at the end of the verse are quite out of order. They\ndescribe the order as to Christ Mystical, but not as to Christ personal.*\n[Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.]\n1Pe. 3:18.-“Being put to death as to the flesh (i.e., as to his human\nnature), but quickened (i.e., raised from the dead) as to his spirit ({6.,\nhis resurrection or spiritual body).” There is no article with either word:\nonly the dative case, describing what happened as to the body. This is\nthe usage of the words “flesh” and “spirit” in 10ο. 15:1-58t [Note: See\nThe Spirits in Prison, by the same author and publisher.] See also\nchap. 4:1.\nHeb. 10:20.-“By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated\n(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , new made) for us, through the veil, that is\nto say, his flesh”: i.e., his human nature, Himself as truly and really\nman.\n1Jn. 4:2.-“Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the\nflesh ({6., in His real human nature) is of God.” Note the three forms\nof the verb ἔρχομαι. Here, it is the perfect participle, ἐληλυθότα\n(eleeluthota), “being come.” In chap. 5:6, it is the aorist participle, ὁ\nἐλθὼν (ho elthqpn), “this is He that came.” While in 2Jn. 1:7, it is the\npresent participle, ἐρχόμενον (erchomenon), “who confess not that\nJesus Christ is coming in the flesh”: i.e., in his human nature, the\nsame Jesus, in like manner as he went into heaven (Act. 1:11).\n\n8. Flesh is put for all living beings\nGen. 6:13.-“The end of all flesh is come before me “: i.e., the end of\nevery living creature. Here, the “all” is literal, because “flesh” is\nfigurative.\nGen. 6:17.-“I ... bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all\nflesh”: {6., every living thing.\nPsa. 136:25.-“Who giveth food to all flesh”: i.e., to every living thing.\n9. The Flesh is put for the animal lusts, and the evil desires of the\nOld nature: and for the Old nature itself\n\nIn Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom. 4:1-25; Rom.\n5:1-21; Rom. 6:1-23; Rom. 7:1-25; Rom. 8:1-39, there are many\nexamples. See\nRom. 8:4.-“Who walk not after the flesh”: i.e., the Old nature. This is\nnot the same as in verse 3.\nRom. 8:13.-“If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die”: i.e., if ye live and\nare ruled by the principles of the Old nature. So in verse 12, and\nfrequently.\n\nSee articles on Romans in Things to Come, 1898 and 1899.\nGal. 5:6.-“Walk in the spirit ({6., in the New nature), and ye shall not\nfulfil the lust of the flesh (i.e., of the old man).”\n10. Blood is put for man, as we say “poor blood” for “poor\nfellow”\nPsa. 94:21.-“They gather themselves together against the soul of the\nrighteous ({6., against the righteous man), and condemn the innocent\nblood “: i.e., the innocent man.\nPro. 1:11.-“Let us lay wait for blood”: i.e., for some man whom we may\nkill.\nMat. 27:4.-“I have sinned in that | have betrayed the innocent blood”:\nie., the innocent man.\nAct. 17:26.-God “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to\ndwell on all the face of the earth”: i.e., out of one man God hath made\nmany different nations. Man is the same all over the world; and,\nthough there are different nations and races all over the world, they\nare all descended from one man.\n11. Flesh and Blood is put for the human nature as distinct from\nthe Divine Nature: or for the body of man as animal, mortal, and\ncorruptible\n\nMat. 16:17.-“Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath\nnot revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” Here, the\nLord uses Peter’s human name “Simon” and his human parentage,\nand “flesh and blood” in order to contrast and emphasize the\ndistinction between these and the Divine origin of the communication\nand revelation. The figure of Synecdoché here puts the emphasis on\nman and humanity: “No human being revealed this unto thee.”\n1Со. 15:50.-“Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God”: i.e.,\nno mortal human being can enter there. Man must be “born again,”\nand “born of the Spirit,” and raised from the dead, or “changed” before\nhe can find entrance into that kingdom. See the rest of the verse, and\ncompare verses 42-49.\nGal. 1:16.-“l conferred not with flesh and blood”: i.e., with no human\nbeing in contrast with God, Who alone revealed to him the Gospel\nwhich he was to preach.\nEph. 6:12.-“We wrestle not against flesh and blood”: i.e., against\nhuman beings, in contrast with wicked spiritual beings.\n\nSee under Metonymy of Adjunct.\nHeb. 2:14.-“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and\nblood, he also himself likewise took part of the same”: i.e., He became\nflesh, and took part in a true and perfect human body.\n\n12. The Head is put for the man himself\n\nWe use the figure when we reckon anything at so much “per head.”\nJdg. 5:30.-“To the head of a man, a damsel, two damsels”: {6., one or\ntwo damsels per head, or for each man.\nHere, there is a double Synecdoché, “a womb” being put for “a\ndamsel.” See below.\n2Ki. 2:3.-“Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from\nthy head (i.e., from thee) to-day?”\nPsa. 3:3 (4).-‘The lifter up of mine head”: ᾖθ., of me: “my head”\nmeaning the same as “my soul.”\nPsa. 7:16 (17).-“His mischief shall return upon his own head”: i.e.,\nupon his own self.\nPsa. 66:12.-“Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads”: {6., over\nus.\nPro. 10:6.-“Blessings are upon the head of the just”: {6., upon the\nman himself.\nIsa. 35:10.-“With songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads”: {6.,\nupon them, themselves.\nSo “blood” is said to be upon the head of anyone, i.e., where “blood” is\nput for the guilt of blood-shedding (Metonymy of the effect) and “head”\nis put (by Synecdoché) for the person himself.\n2Sa. 1:16.-‘And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head”:\nie., thyself.\nSo 1Ki. 2:37. Eze. 33:4. Act. 18:6.\nMat. 27:25.-“His blood (i.e., the guilt of his blood-shedding, by\nMetonymy of the effect) be on us, and on our children.”\n\n13. The Skull, as a part of the man, is put for the man himself\nExo. 16:16.-“An omer a skull”: i.e., an omer per head, or, as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] , an omer “for every man.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.\n\nAnd many other places.\n\n14. The Face is put for the whole man, especially marking and\n\nemphasizing his presence\nSee under Pleonasm.\nGen. 3:19.-“In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread.”\n\nWhen the face perspires, the person himself perspires: but, as it is\nonly the face that is seen, it is that which is mentioned, and is thus put\nfor the whole man.\n\n“Bread,” we have seen, is put by Synecdoché for food in general.\nGen. 19:21.-“See, | have accepted thy face (i.e., thee) concerning this\nthing also.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] margin.\n\nGen. 32:20 (21).-“And afterward | will see his face”: i.e., himself.\nThere are three instances here.\n\n2Sa. 17:11.-Hushai says to Absalom, “I counsel ... that thy face (i.e.,\nthou thyself) go to battle.”\nThere can be but little doubt, as Dr. Ginsburg points out in his\n\nIntroduction to the Hebrew Bible (page 169), that the word а-Га\n(baccrav) rendered to the battle, is an abbreviation in the MSS. for ᾱ-\nrai (b’cheerbam), which means in the midst of them. And so the\nSeptuagint and the Vulgate translate it. Besides, -fa (ch’rab) is never\nused in Samuel for battle. It is always iécia (milchamah). So that the\npassage should read: “I counsel ... that thou go in the midst of them in\nthine own person.”\n1К!. 2:20.-“And the king said unto her, Ask, my mother; for | shall not\nturn back thy face”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “I will not say thee nay,” with\nthe emphasis on “thee.”\n1К!. 10:24.-“And all the earth sought the face of Solomon”: i.e., his\npresence, so as to see him and to speak with him personally.\nJob. 11:19.-“Many shall intreat thy face”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “will\nmake suit unto thee.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.\nPsa. 42:5 (6).-“I shall yet praise Him for the salvations (Heterosis (q.v.\n[Note: Which see.] ) of number: i.e., the great salvation) of His\ncountenance”: i.e., which He (i.e., His presence) shall give me.\n\nSo verse 11 (12): “I shall yet praise Him who is the salvations ({6.,\nthe great salvation) of my countenance (i.e., me myself), and my\nGod.” So Psa. 43:5.\n\nPsa. 132:10.-“For thy servant David\'s sake turn not away the face of\nthine anointed.”\n\nHere the figure emphasizes the last words, meaning not his face\nmerely, but David himself.\n\nPro. 28:21.-Το have respect of faces is not good”: i.e., as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] “persons,” so as to be influenced by personal appearance\nrather than by justice and right.\n\nEcc. 8:1.-“A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine ({6., the man\nhimself), and his hardness is changed.” See under Metonymy.\n\nIsa. 3:15.-“What mean ye that ye ... grind the faces of the poor?” So\nIsa. 36:9 : “Turn away the face of one captain.”\n\nLam. 5:12.-“Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces (i.e.,\npersons) of elders were not honoured.”\n15. The Eye is put for the man himself, in respect to his vision,\nmental or physical\nMat. 13:16.-“Blessed are your eyes ({6., ye), for they (i.e., ye) see.”\nSo Luk. 10:23.\n1Co. 2:9.-“Eye hath not seen”: i.e., no one hath seen.\nAnd many other passages.\n\n16. The Eye lifted up is put for a proud man, and his high looks\nPsa. 18:27 (28).-“Thou wilt save the afflicted people: but wilt bring\ndown high looks (Heb., soaring eyes)”: i.e., proud people.\n\nSo Pro. 6:17 (margin).\n17. The Mouth is put for the whole man, in respect of his\nspeaking\nPro. 8:13.-“The froward mouth (i.e., person) do | hate.”\n18. The Belly is put for man, in respect of his eating\n\nRom. 16:18.-“For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,\nbut their own belly”: {6., their own selves.\nPhp. 3:19.-“Whose God is their belly”: {6., themselves, and what they\ncan get.\nTit. 1:12.-“Slow bellies”: i.e., slow persons, who by reason of large\neating, have grown stout and move slowly.\n\n19. The Womb is put for a female, in respect to her being\n\nmarriageable\n\nJdg. 5:30.-“A womb-two wombs for each man.” The A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nrenders the figure here by the word “damsel.”\n\n20. The Heart is put for the whole man, in respect to his\n\nknowledge or affection\nGen. 31:20.-“And Jacob stole away the heart of Laban”: i.e., Jacob\n\nbaffled Laban’s knowledge by hiding his intentions. So in verse 26,\n\nwhere the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] renders it “unawares,” but see the margin on\n\nverse 26; and in verse 27, “secretly.”\n\n2Sa. 15:6.-“So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel”: i.e.,\n\ngained them through getting their affection.\n\nLuk. 21:34.-“Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts\n\n(i.e., ye) be overcharged with surfeiting,” etc.\n\n21. The Feet are put for the whole man, in respect to carefulness,\nquickness, etc.\n\nPro. 1:16.-“Their feet (i.e., they) run to evil.”\n\nPro. 6:18.-“Feet (i.e., persons) that be swift in running to mischief.” So\n\nIsa. 59:7.\n\nIsa. 52:7.-“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\n\nbringeth good tidings”: i.e., how beautiful or pleasant is the coming of\n\nhim who brings good news. So Rom. 10:15.\n\nRom. 3:15.-Their feet (i.e., they) are swift to shed blood.”\nii. An integral part of men (collectively) is put for the whole, or\nothers associated with them\nExo. 12:40.-One person is mentioned; but with him are\ncomprehended his father Isaac, and his grandfather Abraham.\n\n“Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,\nwas four hundred and thirty years.”\n\nNote that it does not say that Israel’s descendants dwelt in Egypt\n430 years, as the commentators assume, but that their “sojourning”\nlasted that time; reckoning from Abraham (who is included by\nSynecdoché, as is Isaac also).\n\nFour hundred and thirty years was the whole duration of the\nsojourning; as is stated also in Gal. 3:16-17. While the 400 years’\nsojourning is dated from Abraham’s “seed” (Isaac), who was born\nthirty years later. See Gen. 15:18 and Act. 7:6. There are two\nreckonings, starting from two different points, and both ending at the\nExodus.\n\nExo. 17:8; Exo. 17:13.-Amalek (in verse 8) is put for him and his\nwhole army. So Jos. 10:28; Jos. 10:40. 1Sa. 18:7, etc.\nDeu. 33:7.-Only “Judah” is named in the blessing, but in company with\nhim Simeon is understood. For their inheritance and blessing was one.\nJos. 19:1 and Jdg. 1:3.\n\n“And this for Judah,” etc.\n1Ki. 8:66.-“David” is named, but Solomon, his son, is understood\ntogether with him; see 2Ch. 7:10, where it is expressly added; and\n1Ki. 10:9.\n1К!. 10:11.-“The navy of Hiram” is named, but Solomon is included;\nsee 9:26, 27.\n1К!. 11:32.-“One tribe” is mentioned; but, by Synecdoché, Simeon and\nBenjamin are included, as well as the Levites and others who joined\nthe tribe. See 2Ch. 15:9. 1Ki. 12:23. 2Ch. 11:13. All these are\nincluded, by Synecdoché, in 1Ki. 12:20.\n2Ki. 17:18.-The Levites and Benjamites, etc., are included.\nJob. 32:4.-Job is named, but the others are included.\nIsa. 7:2; Isa. 7:5; Isa. 7:8-9; Isa. 9:9.-“Ephraim” is named, because in\nthat tribe was Samaria, the royal city; and because out of that tribe\nwas Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. But by Synecdoché all the ten\ntribes are included.\nPsa. 80:2.-“Ephraim”™* [Note: One of the ancient readings called\n\nSeverin has this: “For the sons of Ephraim,” etc.] includes the ten\n\ntribes, while “Benjamin” includes Judah; and “Manasseh’” includes the\n\ntwo-and-a-half tribes.\n\nPsa. 80:1 (2).-“Joseph” (whose son Ephraim was) is put for all Israel.\n\nAmo. 5:15; Amo. 6:6.-“Joseph’” is put for the ten tribes or the kingdom\n\nof Israel.\n\nJer. 6:1.-“Benjamin” is put for all Judah, on account of their close\n\nconnection with the Gibeathites (see Jdg. 19:16. Hos. 9:9; Hos. 10:9).\niii. A part of a thing is put for the whole of the thing\n1. A Field (uaa, sadeh) is put for a country or region\nGen. 14:7.-“And they smote the whole field (i.e., country) of the\nAmalakites.”\n1Sa. 27:7.-“David dwelt in the field (i.e., country) of the Philistines.”\n2. Corner is put for tower, which was usually placed at the corner\nZep. 1:16.-“A day of trump and alarm against the fenced cities, and\nagainst the high corners”: i.e., towers (with A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ). The word is so\ntranslated in margin of chap. 3:6.\n3. The Baptism of John is put for his ministry\nNot everywhere, but in a few passages.\nAct. 1:22.-“Beginning from the baptism (i.e., the ministry) of John,\nunto that same day that he (Christ) was taken up from us.”\nSo Act. 10:37.\n4. Stones is put for the restored buildings\nPsa. 102:14 (15).-“Thy servants take pleasure in her stones.”\n5. Wall is put for the whole city encompassed by it\nAmo. 1:7.-“| will send a fire on the wall of Gaza (i.e., | will burn the city\nof Gaza with fire, as the rest of the verse declares), which shall devour\nthe palaces thereof.” Amo. 1:10; Amo. 1:14; compare verse 12; and\n2:2, 5, etc.\n6. In like manner Gate is put for the whole city\n\nGen. 22:17.-“Thy seed shall possess the gate ({6., the cities) of his\nenemies.”\n\nThe phrase “within thy gates” means within thy cities. See Exo.\n20:10. Deu. 12:12; Deu. 14:27; Deu. 16:5.\nPsa. 87:2.-“The Lord loveth the gates (i.e., the city) of Zion more than\nall the dwellings of Jacob.”\nJer. 15:7.-“And | will fan them with a fan in the gates (i.e., cities) of the\nland.”\n7. Gate is also put for the inhabitants of the city, or for the people\nwho assemble at its gates\n\nThis may also be considered as Metonymy of the Subject.\nВ. 3:11.-“All the gate ({6., the people assembling there) of my\nPeople doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.”\nRth. 4:10.-“That the name of the dead be not cut off ... from the gate\nof his place”: {6., from his own city and People.\n\nThe two are combined in Isa. 14:31 : “Howl, O gate; cry, O city.” In\nneither case could the gate or the city cry or howl.\n\nTwo classes of people are addressed: first “gate” (a part of the\nwhole) is put, by Synecdoché, for those who assemble there; and then\n“city” is put, by Metonymy of the Subject, for all the inhabitants of the\ncity.\n\n8. The Death of Christ is put for the atonement and its results\n(and see under Metalepsis)\nRom. 5:10.-“We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son”: i.e.,\nnot by the act or article of death only, but by the atonement of which it\nformed only a part.\n\nSo 1Co. 11:26. Col. 1:22.\n\nHeb. 2:14.-“That through death he might destroy him that had the\npower of death.”\n\nHere, the first time the word “death” is used, it is put for the\natonement associated with it; and the second time it means literally\nthe article of death. See under Antanaciasis.\n\n9. The Knob of the Roll is put for the MS. or book itself\nHeb. 10:7.-“In the volume of the book it is written of me.”\n\nHere ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου (en kephalidi bibliou), in the head of the\nbook (κεφαλίς, kephalis, head), is not a synonym for roll, as some try\nto show; but it is the head or knob of the cylinder on which the\nmanuscript was rolled, and which is put, by Synecdoché, for the roll\nand volume itself. It thus corresponds with the Hebrew in Psa. 40:7\n(8): аТ6 ПОГ (Bimegillath sepher), in the scroll of the book, and\nis not a paraphrase, but gives the correct sense.\nIn Heb. 10:7 this book may be taken as referring to Psa. 40:7 (8); but\nwhat about Psa. 40:7 (8), where the same phrase occurs? What is the\nbook referred to there? Surely it must be the book of the eternal\ncovenant referred to in Psa. 139:16.\niv. A part of time is put for the whole time\n1. A Year is put for time, definite and indefinite\nIsa. 61:2.-“To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord”: i.e., the time\nof Christ’s coming.\nIsa. 63:4.-“The year of my redeemed is come.”\nJer. 11:23.-\"I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of\ntheir visitation.”\n2. In the Day is put for an indefinite time\nGen. 2:4.-“When they were created,\n“In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.”\nHere “in the day” in the second line answers to “when’” in the first\nline.\nGen. 2:17.-“In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”\n46] (ϱγφπη), in the day.\n\nA noun with the preposition followed by the verb in the infinitive, as\nhere, becomes an adverb of time, and means simply when, or after\nthen, or after that.\n\nLev. 13:14.-“In the day that raw flesh appear”: in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\n“when,” and in Π.Ν [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,\n“whensoever.”\n\nLev. 14:57.-“To teach in the day of the unclean, and in the day of the\nclean.”\n\nBoth A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nrenders this: “To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean” (see\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] margin).\n\nDeu. 21:16.-“In the day that (/.e., when) he maketh his sons to inherit\nthat which he hath.”\n2Sa. 21:12.-“In the day that (i.e., when) the Philistines had slain Saul\nin Gilboa.”\n1Ki. 2:37.-“It shall be that, on the day thou goest out, and passest\nover the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt\nsurely die.”\n\nThen, after Shimei had gone out, and been to Gath to seek his\nservants, who had run away, and had come back again, “it was told\nSolomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was\ncome again” (verse 41). The king sent for Shimei; and said: “Did | not\nmake thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, saying,\nKnow for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any\nwhither, that thou shalt surely die?”\n\nAfter all this, Solomon proceeded to make Shimei “know for certain\nthat he should surely die.”\n\nIn this case Shimei had been not merely outside his house, but far\naway to Gath, one of the royal cities of the Philistines; and had not\nonly consumed some time on his journeys out and home, but, after he\ngot there, he had to seek his lost servants out and find them.\nTherefore “on the day” could neither be intended nor taken in its literal\nmeaning; but, by Synecdoché, for any indefinite yet certain time. It\nwas so taken by Solomon here: and it is perfectly certain that it is to be\nso understood in Gen. 3:1-24 for in verse 19 the Lord distinctly says:\n“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the\nground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust\nshalt thou return.”\n\nNot “in the day” that Adam ate of the forbidden fruit; for the Lord\ncontemplates him as living on, and he did live for nine hundred and\nthirty years (Gen. 5:5). The interest of the passage in 1Ki. 2:1-46 is\nthat the words are used in exactly the same connection, and with the\ncorresponding figure, Polyptoton (q.v.

But, literally, this verse reads: “Thou hast commanded the\nrighteousness of thy testimonies and faithfulness exceeding” (see\nA.V.

[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nrenders it “o give you hope in your latter end,” and puts in the margin\n“Heb., a latter end and hope.”\n\nAll this is a recognition of the difficulty, without grasping or catching\nthe spirit of the figure: “to give you the end, yes-the end you hope for”:\ni.e., the end which | have promised and on which | have caused you to\nhope and depend. All this, and more, is contained in and expressed by\nthe figure Hendiadys.\n\nJer. 36:27.-“Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah after that the\nking had burned the roll and the words which Baruch wrote”: i.e., the\nroll, yes-and the roll that contained the words of Jehovah too.\n\nDan. 8:10.-“It cast down some of the host and of the stars”: {6., of\nthe starry host. Only one thing, not two.\n\nZep. 1:16.-“A day of trumpet and alarm”: i.e., of the trumpet, yes-and\nan alarming trumpet too.\n\nMat. 3:11.-“He shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”\n\nFirst observe that there are no articles. It is ἐν mMveUpaT! ἁγίῳ καὶ\nTupi (en pneumati hagiqb kai puri), with Holy Spirit and fire: i.e., with\nHoly Spirit, yes-and burning purifying spirit too. Not two things, but one\nthing: Judgment!\n\nThe contrast is with John’s baptism, which was with water which\nmingled together the chaff and the wheat (as the water sign has done\nin all ages). But the new baptism of Christ should not be like that. It\nwould separate the chaff from the wheat by burning it up, as the\nBaptist goes on to declare, without a break in his words: “whose fan is\nin his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat\ninto his garner: but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”\nThe “fire” in verse 11 is different from the “fire” in verse 12. In verse 11\nit is a figure for purifying and cleansing; and in verse 12 it is a literal\nfire that is meant. But the effect of its operations are the same in each\ncase.\n\nThe Baptist is speaking, not of the Church, but of Christ and His\nkingdom, as was prophesied in Isa. 4:3-4 : “And it shall come to pass\nthat he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be\ncalled holy, even every one that is written among the living in\nJerusalem: when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the\ndaughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from\nthe midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of\nburning’: i.e., by spirit of judgment-His consuming.\n\nThis is the purging of the floor, and the burning up of the chaff,\nwhich the Baptist speaks of in verse 12. John only foretold it; but\nChrist shall do it in the day referred to in Isa. 4:1-6\n“The Spirit” is the Worker, and “the fire” denotes His operations,\nsearching, consuming, and purifying. The day of the Lord’s coming will\nbe “like a refiner’s fire ... And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of\nsilver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and. purge them as gold\nand silver” (Mal. 3:1-4). That day “shall burn as an oven; and all the\nproud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble (as in Mat. 3:12):\nand the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.”\nMal. 4:1 (3:19).\n\nThat future judgment is referred to, and not any ecclesiastical\nordinance, is clear from verse 10.\n\nWhen the future baptism of the members of Christ’s mystical body\nwith the Holy Spirit is spoken of there is no mention of or reference to\nfire.\n\nChrist “fans” to get rid of the chaff. Satan “sifts” to get rid of the\nwheat (Luk. 22:31).\n\nMat. 4:16.-“In a region and shadow of death.” This does not denote\ntwo places, but one: in a region, yes-in death’s dark region too, as is\nclear from Isa. 9:1-2 (8:23-9:1).\n\nMat. 24:30.-“They shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of\nheaven with power and great glory”: i.e., with power, yes-with great\nand glorious power.\nMat. 24:31.-“And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a\ntrumpet.” In the margin we learn that the Greek is “with a trumpet and\na great voice.” Here, it is clear that we have not two things but one: “a\ntrumpet, yes-and a great sounding trumpet too.”\nBoth the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nrecognize the Figure Hendiadys here. But the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] gives\nthe literal Greek (according to one reading) in the margin; while the\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] gives as an alternative\nrendering, “Or, a trumpet of great sound’; which represents the\nchange of the second noun into an adjective in a different way.\n\nLuk. 1:17.-“He shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah”:\nie., in spirit, yes-in Elijah’s powerful spirit too.\n\nLuk. 21:15.-“For | will give you a mouth and wisdom’: i.e., a mouth\n(Metonymy, for speech), yes-and a wise mouth too; such wisdom of\nspeech that “all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor\nresist.”\nJoh. 1:17.-“The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came\nby Jesus Christ.” This must be the figure Hendiadys, because\notherwise the words taken literally would not be true to fact.\n\nWas there no “grace” in the Law? How came only Israel to have it\nand not the Babylonians, Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, etc.? Yes;\nit was all grace: as God asks and tells them so earnestly and so often;\nin Deu. 4:32-40, and other places.\n\nAnd was there no “truth” in the Law? Yes; surely, every word was\ntruth.\n\nBut, in Joh. 1:17, the contrast is between one thing that was given\nby Moses, and another and a different thing that came by Jesus\nChrist.\n\nThe figure Hendiadys explains the difficulty and sheds light on the\nverse.\n\nThe Law was given by Moses, and there was grace in it; and\nmoreover it was truth itself: “but grace, yes-and true grace too (the\nreal thing) came by Jesus Christ.\n\nJoh. 3:5.-This is literally, “Except a man shall have been begotten of\nwater and spirit.” There is no article to either of the two nouns.\n\nThat only one thing is meant by the two words is clear from verses\n6 and 8, where only the Spirit (the one) is mentioned.\nThe Lord is speaking to Nicodemus of “earthly things” (see verse\n12). And as “a master in Israel,” he knew (or ought to have known)\nperfectly well the prophecy of Eze. 36:25-27 concerning the kingdom\n(not the Church). Concerning Israel, in the day of their restoration to\ntheir own land, Jehovah had declared: “Then will | sprinkle clean water\nupon you, and ye shall be clean ... And | will put my spirit within you,”\netc.\n\nThe cleansing of that day is not to be with literal water, as in the\nceremonial cleansings of the Law, but with the Spirit of God.\n\nHence only one thing is meant:-“Except a man be begotten of\nwater, yes-and spiritual water too, he cannot enter into the kingdom of\nGod.” That spiritual water stands, by another figure (Metonymy), for\nthe Holy Spirit Himself: as is clear from Joh. 7:38-39 : “water-(But this\nspake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive\n\nHence there is no reference here to ceremonial or ecclesiastical\nwater-but to that baptism of the Spirit which is the one indispensable\ncondition of entering into the kingdom of God; a moral sphere, which\nincludes and embraces the Church of God, here and now, as well as\nthe future kingdom foretold by God through the prophets.\nJoh. 4:21-24.-The one subject of these verses is-What is true\nworship? its nature and its character. It was the sixth word of the Lord\nJesus to the woman of Samaria: “Woman, believe me, the hour\ncometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,\nworship the Father. Ye (Samaritans) worship ye know not what: we\n(Jews) know what we worship: for salvation is of (i.e., proceeds from)\nthe Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers\nshall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh\nsuch to worship Him. God is a spirit (i.e., a Spiritual Being): and they\nthat worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”\n\nHere, notice first that there is only one preposition (év, en), “in,” for\nthe two nouns. It is not to be repeated as in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] It is “in\nspirit and truth.” Moreover, one of the usages of this preposition with\nthe noun turns it into an adverb: so that “in spirit” means “spiritually”:\ni.e., in accordance with another of its meanings, with the spirit, or with\nour spirits. Then, the figure Hendiadys comes in to strengthen this.\n“God is a Spirit! and they that worship Him must worship Him\nspiritually, yes-in a truly spiritual manner too.”\nObserve, further, that the Lord says, “MUST”! There is nothing left\nto our choice or taste in the matter. This “great rubrick” overrides all\nothers: so that it is of no use for anyone to say: “I like this form of\nservice,” or “I prefer that kind of service.” It says, “MUST”! God is a\nSpirit, and therefore He cannot be worshipped by the flesh: i.e., by\nmeans of any of our senses, which are essentially of the flesh. We\ncannot worship God with our eyes, by looking at decorations, however\nbeautiful; we cannot worship Him with our ears, by listening to music,\nhowever ravishing; we cannot worship Him with our noses, by the\nsmelling of incense, however sweet; no! not by any separately or by\nall of them together can we worship a Spiritual Being. All such things\nare, really, only hindrances; which are destructive of all true spiritual\nworship. We, who cannot pray or listen to a prayer without wandering\nthoughts, need no such temptations to attract or distract our spirits\nfrom doing that which God can alone accept. It is a positive cruelty to\nprofessing worshippers to present anything to their senses. It is a\ndevice of the devil to destroy spiritual worship, and to render\nobedience to this great rubric impossible. Hence this impressive figure\nused here, in conjunction with the word “MUST.” It is the same word\nas in chap. 3:7: “Ye MUST be born again”; and chap. 3:14: “The Son\nof man MUST be lifted up.” So here, in the next chap., 4:24: “They that\nworship God, who is a spirit, MUST worship Him with the spirit, yes-\nreally and truly with the spirit.” See further under Hyperbaton; which is\nused in this verse in order to enchance and enforce this interpretation\nof these words.\n\nAct. 1:25.-“That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship,\nfrom which Judas by trangression fell”: i.e., this ministry, yes-this\napostolic ministry, with emphasis on the adjective “apostolic,” which is\nobtained by exchange for the noun.\n\nAct. 3:14.-“But ye denied the Holy One and the Just.” Here, it is\nperfectly clear that only One Person is meant, though two are\napparently described: i.e., “ye denied the Holy One, yes-the righteous\nHoly One, and desired a murderer (an unrighteous criminal) to be\ngranted unto you.” By the use of this figure here the contrast between\nthat “righteous” one and the criminal is strongly marked and\nemphasized.\n\nAct. 14:13.-“Then the priest of Jupiter which was (i.e., whose statue\nstood) before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates,\nand would have done sacrifice.”\n\nIn the heathen worship, the victim to be sacrificed was always\ndecorated with a garland immediately before the sacrifice took place,\nas may be seen to-day in pictures and sculptures. There were two\nthings then brought by the priest, but there is only one idea; and the\nfigure tells us and shows us that every arrangement had been made,\nand that all was ready; nothing hindered the immediate offering of the\nsacrifice. “The priest ... brought oxen, yes-and they had their garlands\non too.” All this gives a vivid picture; and the whole scene is presented\nto our minds by the employment of this simple yet beautiful and\nexpressive figure, “oxen and garlands.”\n\nAct. 23:6.-“Of the hope and resurrection of the dead | am called in\nquestion”: i.e., of the hope, yes-the resurrection hope ... am | called in\nquestion.\n\nRom. 1:5.-“By whom we have received grace and apostleship”: i.e.,\ngrace, yes-and apostolic grace too.\n\nRom. 2:27.-“Letter and circumcision.” See under Ellipsis, page 23.\nRom. 11:17.-“And with them partakest of the root and the fatness of\nthe olive tree”: i.e., the root, yes-and the fat or prolific root; or the rich\nblessings which come forth from that root.* [Note: See Article on “The\nFig, the Olive, and the Vine” in Things to Come for July, 1899.]\n\n1Со. 2:4.-“In demonstration of the Spirit and of power”: {6., of the\nSpirit, yes-of the power of the Spirit too.\n\n1Co. 11:7.-‘Forasmuch as he is the image and glory ({6., the\nglorious image) of God.”\n\nEph. 4:11.-“And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and\nsome, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers”: i.e., pastors (or\nshepherds), yes-shepherds who should feed too; or teachers, yes-\nteachers who should shepherd too. Not two classes of persons, but\none; implying that a shepherd who did not feed would fail in his duty;\nand so would a teacher who failed to be a pastor.\n\nEph. 5:5.-“Hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of\nGod”: i.e., the kingdom of Christ, yes-of Christ who is truly God.\n\nEph. 6:18.-“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the\nSpirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and\nsupplication for all saints’: /е., praying with all prayer (this is\nPolyploton, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) and supplication: i.e., prayer, yes-\nwith supplicating prayer too; and watching thereunto with every kind of\nsupplication, yes, with persevering supplication too.\n\nCol. 2:8.-“Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and\nvain deceit.”\n\nHere, we have not two things, but one: through philosophy, yes-a\nvain, deceitful philosophy too.\n\nCol. 2:18.-“Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary\nhumility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which\nhe hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.”\n\nThe marginal notes in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] show the difficulties created by not seeing the\nHendiadys here.\n\nIt is certain that θρησκεία (threeskeia) means religion (not\nworship), and is so rendered in all the other places where it occurs\n(see Act. 26:5. Jam. 1:26-27). It must be so rendered here: “humility\nand religion”: i.e., humility, yes-the religious humility of angels.\n\nIf we observe this figure, it throws all the other words into their\nright places, and enables us to give them their right meanings. This\ngives sense also to the reading of all the Textual Critics, and with the\nΠ.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] in omitting the negative µή\n(mee) before the word “seen.” It also saves our having to condemn\nthese Colossian saints for angel-worship! Surely there is nothing in\nthis epistle to warrant the conclusion that they had fallen as low as\nthat | The passage is a warning to the saints who had been well-\ninstructed as to their standing in Christ that they were not to forget in\ntheir worshipping the Father that they had a higher standing than that\nof angels, even that of beloved sons, in the acceptance of “the\nBeloved One.” They had “boldness of access” as sons, and not merely\nthat which pertained to “angels” as messengers.\n\nWe cannot think that this is a mere warning not to make angels an\nobject of worship. Such a thought is far below the whole scope and\nteaching of the epistle.\nThe verse then will read: “Let no one deprive you of your prize,\nhaving pleasure in (so Lightfoot) the religious humility of angels, taking\nhis stand upon (so R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin)\nthe things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his\nflesh (i.e., by his old nature) and not holding the head,” etc.\n\nIf we hold the great truth of the “Mystery” concerning the Head and\nmembers of the Body of Christ, we shall understand and take our\nproper standing before God, which He himself has given us.\n\nTo cease from “holding the Head” is to lose practically all our\nspecial privileges as members of His Body. It is to take up an attitude\nbefore God, in our access to Him, below that in which His love and\ngrace has set us. It is to take the place of religious humility as the\nangels, as servants instead of sons-even the sons of God. It is to\nworship with veiled faces at a distance, instead of with unveiled faces,\nbeholding the glory of the Lord. It is a reigned humility, not\napprehending the exceeding riches of the grace of God toward us in\nChrist Jesus; which is sure to issue in a regard for visible things and\nreligious ordinances which are the natural objects of the fleshly mind\n(the Old nature), the only things which it can comprehend or\nunderstand. Hence the theme of ordinances being done away in\nChrist follows in verses 11-15. “Which sort of things have indeed an\nappearance of wisdom in self-devised religious observances and\nhumiliation (of mind) and discipline (of the body); yet are not really of\nany value to remedy indulgence of the flesh* [Note: See R.V. and\nLightfoot (Com. in loco) for this beautiful and happy rendering.] (ie.,\nthe Old nature).”\n\nThe exhortation is plural; but the warning is directed against some\nindividual, who, puffed up and led by his Old nature, would fain teach\nthem that as angels in their worship “veiled their faces” and take the\nmost humble place, therefore it was only becoming that they should\ndo the same. These were the only things which the “flesh” could see;\nthis was the standing that the flesh would fain take! But they were not\nto be thus defrauded of that high calling and standing which they had\nin Christ, and which enabled them to draw near with boldness to the\nthrone of grace.\n1Th. 2:12.-“That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you\nunto his kingdom and glory”: i.e., his kingdom, yes-his glorious\nkingdom too; or, his glorious kingdom, with emphasis on the word\n“glorious.”\n1Ti. 3:15.-“The Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the\ntruth.”\n\nThis is spoken of “the truth”-“the mystery of the faith” (verse 9),\nand “the mystery” which is “confessedly great” (verse 16). This is the\npillar, yes-the great foundation pillar of the truth: i.e., Christ Mystical,\nas set forth in verse 16.* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author\nand publisher. Price sixpence.]\n\n2Ti. 1:10.-“Our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death and\nhath brought life and immortality to light”: /е., life, yes-and immortal\nlife too.\n\n2Ti. 4:1-2.-This verse requires re-translating; owing to the Figures,\nand the older readings witnessed to by the Critical Texts and the R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n“| adjure thee, therefore, before God, yes-Christ Jesus, | mean\n(1Ti. 5:21), who is about to judge the living and dead; and [/ adjure\nthee] by His appearing, yes-and His royal appearing too, Preach the\nWord.” For this judgment shall be when He “shall sit upon the throne\nof His glory,” not in the act of His first shining forth at His epiphaneia.\nThe adjuration is similar to Deu. 4:26; Deu. 30:19; Deu. 31:28, and is\ncalled forth by the fact that the Scriptures are God-breathed and\nprofitable. “Therefore” it is that “I adjure thee” to preach the word. The\nsolemn adjuration is needed, because of the fact that “the time will\ncome when they will not endure sound teaching.” This is no reason\nwhy preachers should seek for something that men will endure, but it\nis given as the very reason why the word of God and that alone should\nbe persistently proclaimed and taught. It is a reason so strange that\nthe charge has to be set in the full view of coming judgment. Hence, in\nverses 1 and 8, the fact of judgment is twice stated. The charge is\nbeset with judgment before and behind.\n\nThe figure Hendiadys, which the Spirit twice employs to enhance\nthe force of the words, the enemy uses to obscure it; trading by his\ndevices on the ignorance of those who profess to be preachers of this\nWord.\n\nTit. 2:13.-“Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing.”\nNot two things but one: our hope is the glorious appearing!\nThe latter clause is also Hendiadys: One Person being meant, not\ntwo: the appearing of the great God, yes-even our Saviour Jesus\nChrist: i.e., our Divine Saviour.\n\nJam. 3:9.-“Therewith bless we God, even the Father.” Lit., the God\nand Father: i.e., God, yes-even that God who is our Father.\n\n2Pe. 1:3.-“Through the knowledge of him who hath called us to glory\nand virtue.”\n\nBut the Greek is “by,” as stated in the margin, διά (dia) with the\ngenitive, denoting the cause or instrument. The R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] renders it “by his own glory and virtue” (and\ntells us, in the margin, that “some ancient authorities read through\nglory and virtue”), translating the figure literally, and (like the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] ), missing the force of it.\n\nBut it is one thing, not two.\n\nNote that the Critical Texts read idia (idee), his own, instead of διά\n(dia), through, the dative case denoting the agency, by.\n\nNote also that ἀρετή (aretee) means goodness, excellence in art\nor workmanship; goodness, as shown by the possession of reputation\nbravery and merit. This is what God has called His people by: His own\ngoodness, will and power, yes-His glorious power too; His own\nexcellent workmanship, His own gracious dealing.\n\n2Pe. 1:16.-“When we made known unto you the power and coming”:\nie., either the coming power, or the powerful coming, or both.\n\n2Pe. 1:17.-“For he received from God the Father honour and glory”:\ni.e., honour, yes-and glorious honour too.\n\nChrist received this glorious honour, which was put upon Him, “on\nthe holy mount’ of transfiguration.\n\nThe wondrous act which there took place was the official anointing,\nappointing, and consecrating of Christ for His Priestly office and\nsacrificial work. The only subject spoken of on that mount was “the\nExodus which He should accomplish at Jerusalem” (Luk. 9:31). Not\nthe death to which man should put Him, but “which He should\naccomplish” Himself. Heb. 2:9 distinctly tells us why Christ was thus\ncrowned: 2Pe. 1:17-18, tells us where.\nIt tells us that He was made a little lower than the angels for the\nsuffering of death; crowned with glory and honour, that He, by the\ngrace of God, should taste death for every man” (see Synecdoché).\n\nThis is confirmed by Exo. 28:2, where we are distinctly told that,\nwhen Aaron was consecrated to his priestly office, “that he may\nminister unto me in the priest\'s office,” “thou (Moses) shalt make holy\ngarments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty.” Here are the\nsame two words, τιµὴ καὶ δόξα (timee kai doxa), for honour, yes-and\nfor glorious honour too!\n\nCan we resist the conclusion that on the Holy Mount the Lord\n\nJesus was thus consecrated for His (Melchisedekian) priesthood.\nTrue, Moses was there, and Elijah; but this glorious honour with which\nChrist was clothed and crowned was put upon Him by no earthly\nhands. It came “from the excellent glory.\"* [Note: For further\nelucidation of the Transfiguration and its objects, see Christ’s\nProphetic Teaching, by the same author and publisher.]\nRev. 5:10.-Here we must adopt the rendering of the R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] : “And madest them to be unto our God a\nkingdom and priests, and they reign upon the earth”: i.e., a kingdom,\nyes-and a great priestly kingdom too, the plural “priests” being put by\nHeterosis for the singular, denoting the greatness.\n2. Verbs\n\nMat. 13:23.-The Hendiadys is disguised in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nthrough the separation of the two words: “He that was sown upon the\ngood ground, this is he who hears and understands the word.” The\nperson who heareth and understandeth is one. One act is meant, and\nnot two. All hear, but this one heareth, yes-and understandeth it too.\nLuk. 6:48.-“He is like a man ... who dug and deepened, and laid the\nfoundation on the rock.”\n\nHere, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] renders it: “and digged deep.” The R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] : “who digged and went deep.”\n\nIt is clear that we have the figure Hendiadys in the two verbs: the\nman digged, yes-and very deep; deeper and deeper indeed till he got\nto the rock itself.\n\nAct. 9:31.-“Then ... the churches ... were edified and walking in the\nfear of the Lord ... were multiplied.\n\nHere, in the Received Text, the verbs are not in the same\ninflection. But the Critical Texts (L. [Note: . Lachmann and his critical\nGreek Text.] T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his critical Greek Text.] Tr.\n[Note: r. Tregelles and his critical Greek Text.] A. [Note: . Alford and\nhis critical Greek Text.] WH. [Note: H. Westcott and Hort, and their\ncritical Greek Text.] , and Π.Ν.

Luk. 1:21; Luk. 3:15; Luk. 7:19-20; Luk. 8:40; Luk.\n12:46. Act. 3:5; Act. 10:24; Act. 27:33; Act. 28:6 (twice). 2Pe. 3:12-14.]\nand “hasting” is σπεύδω (δρειαφ), to hasten. Everywhere elset\n[Note: Luk. 2:16; Luk. 19:5-6. Act. 20:16; Act. 22:18.] the latter verb is\nintransitive; but here it is transitive to correspond with “looking for,”\nand means {ο be eager or earnest for a thing. № qualifies the “looking\nfor’ and not the “coming” itself: i.e., looking for, yes-and earnestly\nlooking for that coming too.\n\nWe cannot hasten that day, which is fixed in the counsels of God,\nbut we can be more eager and earnest in our looking for it. The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “earnestly desiring the\ncoming.” This is better; but it is stronger when we recognize the figure-\nlooking for and being earnest for, which is the figure Hendiadys;\nearnestly looking for, with the emphasis on earnestly.\n\nRev. 20:4.-“And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years”:\nie., they lived, yes-and they reigned too.\n\nRev. 22:17.-“And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever willeth,\nlet him take.” Not two classes of persons, but one. Not thirsty ones\nwho do not will; or willing ones who do not thirst; but willing thirsty\nones, let them come: See under Epistrophe.',''),(113,113,'hendiatris','Jer. 4:2.-“And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment,\nand in righteousness”: {6., thou shalt swear, in truth (/.e., truly, yes-\njustly and righteously).\n\nIn swearing by Jehovah in truth, justice and righteousness is\nincluded; not only that people swear the truth (Lev. 19:12. Num. 30:3.\nJer. 5:2. Mat. 5:33), but also that they swear by Jehovah alone (i.e.,\njustly and righteously), and not by idols also, as, according to Zep. 1:5,\nthey did in his day.* [Note: Scott, Com. in loco.]\n\nDan. 3:7.-“All the people, the nations, and the languages fell down\nand worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had\nset up.”\n\nNow “languages” do not fall down; neither do they worship;\nTherefore the words are used as a figure, and the figure is Hendiatris:\nAll the people, yes-and people of all nations and languages, fell down\nand worshipped.\n\nMat. 6:13.-“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory”:\nie., for thine is the kingdom, yes-and the powerful and glorious\nkingdom too.\n\nJoh. 14:6.-“I am the way, and the truth, and the life.” This is hidden\nin the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] which ignores the first “and.”\n\nThe whole subject of conversation here is Christ as “the way.” See\nthe context. We have here therefore another example of Hendiadiatris:\n“lam the way, yes-the true and living way; for no man cometh unto the\nFather, but by me.”\n\nOf course, Christ is the “truth,” as He is also the “life”: but this is\nnot what is stated in this verse. Here, only one subject is in question:\nviz., “the way”; and the other two nouns are used to define its true\nnature and character.',''),(114,114,'catachresis','i. Of two words, where the meanings are remotely akin\nLev. 26:30.-‘I will cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols.”\n\nHere the word “carcase” is changed from its strictly correct\napplication to flesh and blood, and its use applied to the fragments of\nwood or stone of an idol.\n\nNum. 9:18.-“At the mouth of Jehovah.”\n\nHere it is translated “commandment”: but the figure arrests us; and\npoints us to the Divine Source of the command as opposed to any\nhuman injunction. See Epistrophe.\n\nDeu. 16:7.-“And thou shalt cook and eat it in the place which the Lord\nthy God shall choose.”\n\nBoth A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\n\nrender it “roast.” The latter however puts seethe in the margin.\n“Seethe” is sometimes used for cook: and thus there is a remote\nconnection with roast, as commanded, in Exo. 12:8-9. So 1Sa. 2:15.\nCompare Joe. 3:13 (4:13).\n\nDeu. 32:14.-“Thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.”\n\nHere “blood” is used by Catachresis. For, as “blood” is that which\ncomes from man, so the juice is that which comes from the grape.\nThere is an incongruity, because the two are only remotely akin. But\nour attention is attracted to what is being said.\n2Sa. 23:17.-“Is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of\ntheir lives?”\nThe water which the three mighty men brought to David is called\ntheir blood: and thus, in one incongruous word, is eloquently\nexpressed the shedding of their own blood, which the men had risked\nfor David\'s sake.\n\nJob. 4:12.-“Now a word was brought by stealth to me.”\n\nThis is a most unusual way of describing an angelic\ncommunication.\n\nPsa. 74:1.-“Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy\npasture?”\n\nPsa. 80:4 (5).-“How long wilt thou smoke against the prayer of thy\npeople?” (margin).\n\nUsed by Catachresis for the heat of anger.\n\nPsa. 88:5.-“Free among the dead”: {6., set at liberty is put by\nCatachresis for cast off, deserted.\n\nIsa. 62:5.-“For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons\nmarry thee.”\n\nTo speak of sons marrying their mother is incongruous, and yet\nwhat else could be said? How else could it be expressed? But ané.\n(baal) means not only {ο marry, but to possess; or as we express it “to\nhave and to hold’ in possession. This is the primitive and proper\nmeaning of the word, and to marry is only a secondary usage. It\nmeans to have, own, possess. See 1Ch. 4:22, “who had the dominion\nin Moab”; Isa. 26:13, “other lords beside thee have had dominion over\nus.”\n\nIt is from not seeing the beautiful figure Catachresis here, by\nwhich, through what looks like an incongruity, that Bishop Lowth and\nothers suggest an emendation of the Hebrew Text, by reading adée\n(bonahyik), thy builders, for adée (bahnayik), thy sons. The change\nis plausible; but it is destitute of any MS. or other ancient authority;\nand such arbitrary alterations of the Text are to be deprecated, being\npurely conjectural. Moreover, it is unnecessary, for the builder is not\nnecessarily the possessor or the owner. The apparent incongruity of\nthe figure arrests our attention; and, when we give the attention which\nis thus demanded, we find the passage means that as a young man\nmarries a virgin, so shall Zion’s sons hold her in sure and happy\npossession.\n\nHos. 14:2 (3).-“So will we render the calves of our lips”: /.e., our lips\nas sacrifices. See under Metonymy; and compare Heb. 13:15.\nMat. 12:5.-“On the sabbath days the Priests in the temple profane the\nsabbath, and are blameless.” It sounds incongruous to state this as a\nfact: but it expresses what was true according to the mistaken notions\nof the Pharisees as to manual works performed on the sabbath.\nRom. 7:23.-1 see another law in my members.” He means that he\nsees sin: which, through the authority with which it rules his members,\nhe calls, by Catachresis, “law.” See under Antanaclasis.\n1Co. 1:25.-“The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the\nweakness of God is stronger than men.” It is incongruous to speak of\n“foolishness” or “weakness” with respect to God. So we are arrested\nby the use of this figure Catachresis.\nCol. 3:5.-“Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.”\nThe members which commit the sins are put by a forcible Catachresis\nfor the sins themselves. For the sins are immediately enumerated, not\nthe members. See chap. 2:11.\nii. Of two words, where the meanings are different\n\nExo. 5:21.-“Ye have made our savour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh.”\n\nHere “stink” and “eyes” are incongruously conjoined to call our\nattention to the highest degree of abhorrence.\nExo. 20:18 (15).-“And all the people saw the thunderings.”\n\nHere seeing is joined to what was only heard. But see under\nZeugma, by which one verb is made to go with two different nouns.\n(See Rev. 1:12 below).\n\nMar. 7:21-22.-“Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts ... an evil eye.”\nHere the Catachresis is only in appearance, as “an evil eye” is put\nby Metonymy for envy, which does proceed out of the heart.\n\nCompare Mat. 20:15, and see further under Asyndeton.\n1Ti. 6:19.-“Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”\n\nHere the “laying up treasure” is joined with “foundation,” and\n“laying hold” is joined with the house which is from heaven. 2Co. 5:2.\nRev. 1:12.-“And | turned to see the voice that spake with me.”\n\nHere “voice” is put by Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ), for the\nperson speaking. Apart from this, there is a Catachresis; seeing being\njoined with that which is invisible and only heard. (See Exo. 20:18.)\n\niii. Of one word, where the Greek receives its real meaning by\n\npermutation from another language, or foreign usage\nMat. 8:6. Act. 4:27.-Where traic (pais), a child, is used of a servant,\nfrom the Hebrew αἴζ (nahar), which has both meanings. The A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] renders it “servant” in Matt., and “child” in Acts; while the R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “servant” in both places,\nspelling it in Acts “Servant.”\n\nMat. 11:25; Luk. 10:21; Rom. 14:11; Heb. 13:15.- ὁμολογεῖν\n(homologein), to confess, is used of to praise or celebrate, like the\nHebrew alaa (hqdah) which has both meanings. See Gen. 49:8.\n2598. 22:50.\n\nMat. 24:29.-“And the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.” Here,\nδυνάμεις (dunameis), powers, means really armies, from the Hebrew\naéé (chayeel) which has both meanings.\n\nMat. 28:1.-μία (mia), one, is the Greek cardinal numeral, but it is used\nhere for the ordinal, first, like the Hebrew fca (echad), which has\nboth meanings. See Gen. 1:5, etc. (See Mar. 16:9.)\n\nLuk. 1:37.-“For with God nothing shall be impossible.” Here, ῥῆμα\n(rheema), word or saying, is used for thing, the Hebrew aar (davar)\nhaving both meanings. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nrenders ῥῆμα literally; αἱ the expense of forcing the word ἀδυναρήσει\n(adunateesei), shall be impossible; which it renders “shall be void of\npower.”\n\nLuk. 16:17.-“It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of\nthe law to fail.” Here, ρίρτειν (piptein), to fall or fail, is used for not to\nbe fulfilled, or to be of no effect (Rom. 9:6. 1Sa. 3:19). The Hebrew\n66 (naphal) has both meanings. See Jos. 23:14. Est. 6:10.\n\nThe reference to the ‘tittle’ is interesting, and very beautifully\nincludes both the meanings.\n\nThe σῖα (cheren), horn, is called in the Greek κεραία (keraia), little\nhorn (Mat. 5:18 and Luk. 16:17). Another, and commoner Hebrew\nname is ufari (taageem), little crowns.* [Note: The plural of )6\n(cheren), horn, is !¥/UOZ> | (ch’rahnoth), horns.]\n\nThe Massorah explains that the /ittle horn or crown is an ornament\nor little flourish (something like a tiny fleur-de-lis, of various forms, or a\nmere hair-line flourish) placed above certain letters and coming out\nfrom their top, according to certain definite and prescribed rules. Thus\nthe common fancy, which is as old as Jerome, is exploded: which\nexplained the “tittle” as being the difference between two similar\nletters: e.g., Daleth (A) and Resh (1); Beth (A) and Kaph (6), etc.\n\nThe meaning of the passage is that it is easier for heaven and\nearth to pass away, than for one of these Taagim, or little crowns to\nfall, or for the minutest word of God not to be fulfilled.\nAct. 10:22. Luk. 1:6; Luk. 2:25.-δίκαιος (dikaios), which is an\nadjective, and means strictly righteous, is used generally for a good\nman, like the Heb., 6aé- (tzaddeek), which has both meanings.\n\nAct. 13:34.-“The sure mercies of David.”\n\nHere the words τὰ ὅσια (ta hosia), holy or just things, are used for\npromises made, and mercies vouchsafed, in pure grace; the Heb.\ncnaéi (chasadeem) having both meanings. The quotation is from\nIsa. 15:3; and the reference is to Jehovah’s unconditional covenant\nmade with David in 2Sa. 7:1-29 The passage means “I will give to you\nthe faithful promises made to David.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] gives an unusually long marginal note; and the\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “I will give you the\nholy and sure blessings of David’; which is very laboured and\nobscure, compared with the simplicity of meaning conveyed and\nbrought out by the figure Catachresis, which shows that 2Sa. 7:1-29\nwas in question, and the holy things, i.e., the promises, there made in\ngrace to David.\n1Со. 2:6.-“Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.”\nHere the word τέλειος (teleios) receives its true meaning, initiated,\nfrom the Greek mysteries, where it was used of one who had been\ninitiated into them.\n1Co. 15:54.-“Death is swallowed up in victory”: i.e., for ever, as the\nHeb. ἄδς (netzach) means, as well as victory, when it has the\nLamed (ὅ) prefixed. See Isa. 25:8 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] ). Amo. 1:11 (both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ). Also Psa. 13:1 (2). Pro. 21:28.\n2Co. 6:12; 2Co. 7:15. Luk. 1:78. Col. 3:12. Php. 1:8.- σπλάγχνα\n(splangna), bowels, is used for mercy, like the Heb., rciéi\n(rachameem), which has both meanings.\n\nSee Gen. 43:30. Psa. 51:1 (3). Pro. 12:10. When used with the\nword “mercies” itself, it denotes tender mercies.\n\nGal. 2:21.-“I do not frustrate (or esteem at a small price) the grace of\nGod: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead (i.e.,\ndied) in vain.” Here, δωρεάν (dqrean), a free gift, is put for µάτην\n(mateen), in vain; and the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] so translates it. The R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “for nought.” But, like\nthe Heb. cdi (chinnam), µάτην means in vain, while δωρεάν means\nwithout a cause. See Psa. 109:3.\n\n1Th. 4:4, and 1Pe. 3:7, where σκεῦος (skeuos), a vase or utensil, is\nused for the Heb. 666 (klee), which has a wider meaning,\ninstrument or weapon. See Hos. 13:15, and 1Sa. 21:3-6.\n\nHeb. 11:31; Jam. 2:25.-“The harlot Rahab”: where πόρνη (pornee), a\nharlot, receives its true meaning from the Heb. élda (zqbnah) which\nmeans a female hostess, or landlady, as well as harlot.\n\n1Pe. 3:14.-δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee), righteousness, is used of\nordinary piety, kindness, etc. So 2Co. 9:9. Mat. 6:1 according to one\nreading (see Metonymy and Synecdoche).\n\nRev. 2:7; Rev. 22:2; Rev. 22:14.-‘The tree of life.” In the Greek €UAov\n(xylon) means wood; but receives its meaning of “tree” from the Heb.\nᾖό (eytz), tree, which is frequently rendered €UAov (xylon) in the LXX.\n[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\nRev. 14:8; Rev. 18:3.-“She hath made all nations drink of the wine of\nthe wrath of her fornication.” Here, θυμός (thumos), wrath, means\nheat, as well as anger; like the Heb. cia (cheymah), heat, venom, or\npoison. See Job. 6:4, where the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint\nVersion (325 b.c.).] renders it θυµός (thumos), evil or affliction, as\nMat. 6:34. So that the meaning is “the heating or poisonous wine of\nher fornication.”',''),(115,115,'metallage','Hos. 4:18.-“Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom\ncontinually: her rulers with shame do love, ‘Give ye.’ ”',''),(116,116,'antonomasia','Gen. 31:21.-The Euphrates is called “the river’ on account of its\ngreatness. See also Jos. 24:2. Psa. 72:8; Psa. 80:11 (12), where also\n“the sea” is put for “the Great Sea,” which is another Antonomasia for\nthe Mediterranean. See also Mic. 7:12.\n1Sa. 4:21.-“And she named the child ‘In-glorious’ (i.e., /-chabqbd),\nsaying, ‘The glory is departed,’ ” /-chabqbd meaning there is no glory.\nThe name occurs once more, in chap. 14:3.\nIsa. 62:4.-\n\n“Thou shalt no more be termed ‘Forsaken’;\n\nNeither shall thy land any more be termed ‘Desolate’:\nBut thou shalt be called ‘Hephzi-bah’ (i.e., my delight is in her),\nAnd thy land ‘Beulah’ (i.e., married).”\n\nHere note that the four lines are alternate: the subject of the first\nand third being the People, while that of the second and fourth is the\nLand.\n\nHos. 1:6.-“And He said unto him, Call her name ‘Not-having-\nobtained-mercy (i.e., Lo-ruhamah).”\n\nHos. 12:13 (14).-Moses is called “a Prophet,” because he was par\nexcellence the prophet.

See Hendiadys.\nAct. 22:14.-“The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou\nshouldest know his will, and see that Just (or Righteous) One”: i.e.,\nthe Lord Jesus. Thus was Paul led of the Spirit to avoid the use of any\nword which would excite and inflame them. By this means he obtained\naudience, until, in verse 21, he had to use the word “Gentiles” (“I will\nsend thee far hence unto the Gentiles”), when we read: “And they\ngave him audience unto this word.”\nAct. 25:26.-The Roman Emperor is called “my lord.”\n\nThe Divine Names and Titles are sometimes the attributes of God\nused as proper names:-\n\nGod is called the Strong One (El); or, the Most High (Elyqpn).

Hence the Euphemy, the meaning of which is given in the\nmargin. See also 1Sa. 24:3.\n\n2Sa. 18:32.-David enquired of Cushi: “Is the young man Absalom\nsafe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all\nthat rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.”\n\nThus, by two beautiful Euphemisms, Cushi reminded David of\nAbsalom’s treason and its deserts, while he also intimated that he had\nbeen slain.\n\nRth. 3:9.-“Spread ... thy skirt over thine handmaid”: i.e., receive me in\nthe way of marriage.\n\n2Ki. 22:20.-“I will gather thee unto thy fathers (i.e., thou shalt die), and\nthou shalt be gathered into thy grave (i.e., be buried) in peace.”\n\nNeh. 4:23 (17).-“None of us put off our clothes, saving that every one\nput them off. for washing.” (Margin, every one went with his weapon\nfor water.)\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is no clearer: “None\nof us put off our clothes, every one went with his weapon to the\nwater”; and puts it in the margin: “The text is probably faulty”! This is\nlike man; who always thinks the fault is in the Text instead of in\nhimself. When he meets with a difficulty, it never dawns on him that\nthe difficulty lies in his own head, or is of his own creating!\n\nThe Hebrew is literally: “None of us put off our clothes; each man\nwent with his weapon (or tool) and water”: i.e., he discharged his\nwater as he was (or as he stood): i.e., there was neither time nor\nopportunity for retiring and for that laborious arrangement of the\nclothes which an Eastern requires. And thus the simple Euphemy is\nmost expressive, and explains, instead of needing an explanation\n(which after all does not explain)!\nGlassius would treat the word “water” as a Synecdoche by which\n“water,” the most important part of a man’s ration, is put for all of it.\n“This would require the translation: “Each one went with his sword and\nwater”: i.e., one single weapon and one measured ration, “water”\nbeing used alone for a measured ration, as it was a very important\npart of the rations served out. Just as “salt” was served and measured\nout to the Roman soldiers, and afterwards was used by Synecdoche\nof the whole ration of which it was a part. Hence our term “salt-\nmoney”; and the Latin, sa/arium, and English, salary. When we say “a\nman is not worth his salt,” we preserve this Synecdoche; and, putting\na part for the whole, we mean that he is not worth his salary.\n\nSo it may be here in Neh. 4:23. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] , with these marginal renderings, clearly\nshow that something more is meant than what is said. But we believe\nthat the figure of Euphemy sufficiently and satisfactorily explains it.\n\nThere is, however, something to be said for Glassius’s suggestion\nas to Synecdoche.\n\nOne thing is clear, which makes either figure explain or express\nthe one fact that is specially emphasized: viz., that Nehemiah and his\ncompanions were building the wall with a trowel in one hand and a\nsword in the other (4:17 (11), etc). So exigent were the circumstances\nthat they worked all night, and could take with them no armour or\nsupplies of food. A single weapon and a single ration were all they\ncould take.\n\nOr so exigent were the circumstances that there was not even the\nusual opportunity for performing the functions of nature in the ordinary\nway. In either case the figure read in the light of the context shows the\nurgency of the circumstances.\n\nJob. 10:21-22.-Here, we have two beautiful Periphrases: “Before | go\nwhence | shall not return (i.e., before | die), even to the land of\ndarkness and the shadow of death”: i.e., the grave, etc. So Job. 16:22.\nJob. 18:13.-\"The first-born of death shall devour his strength”: i.e., the\ncruellest and most calamitous death shall destroy him.\n\nJob. 18:14.-Death is called “the king of terrors”: i.e., the terrible king\nwho claims so many subjects.\n\nPsa. 94:17.-“Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost\n(marg., quickly) dwelt in silence”: i.e., | should soon have been dead\nand buried.\n\nIsa. 38:10.-“I shall go to the gates of the grave (Sheo/)”: i.e, | shall die.\nThis explains Mat. 16:18; where the corresponding word (Hades) is\nused, and in the same sense: {6., death shall not prevail against the\naccomplishment of God’s purposes.\n\nEcc. 3:21.-See Appendix E, and Erotesis.\n\nEcc. 12:1-7..We have a series of connected Periphrases and\nEuphemisms.\n\nOne of them is worthy of a longer notice:-\n\nEcc. 12:5. - “And desire shall fail.” We have already considered this\nunder Metalepsis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), because there is a double\nMetonymy. But there is a beautiful latent Euphemy as well. The\n“caper-berry’ is put for the condiment made from it, and then the\ncondiment is put for the appetite or desire created by it.\n\nBut as this condiment was supposed specially to create sexual\ndesire, the Euphemy is elegantly expressed in the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] (“and\ndesire shall fail”). The sense is absurdly lost in the R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] ; while to make the obscurity caused by the\nliteral translation still greater, it is suggested in the margin that “fail”\nmay mean “burst.”\nThis is certainly one of the many passages in which the A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nfar exceeds the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] in beauty as\nwell as accuracy, and shows that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] is a Version, while\nthe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is a Trans/ation.\n\nMat. 8:11.-“Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit\ndown with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nThis was a beautiful Euphemism; to avoid giving offence (at that\nstage of Christ\'s ministry) to the Jews, who grudged the blessings\nbeing extended to Gentiles.\n\nMat. 11:19 and Luk. 7:35.-“But wisdom is justified of (or on the part\nof) her children.” By this Euphemy the Lord Jesus condemns those\nwho received Him not.\n\nTrue wisdom was shown in submitting to the Son of God: “Be wise\nnow therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.”\nThese words were written (Psa. 2:10) with special reference to the\nreception of the Messiah: and all who were truly wise submitted\nthemselves. Those who did not are thus rebuked.\n\nJoh. 2:25.-“He knew what was in man.” This is а solemn\ncondemnation of man; and shows something of his true nature and\ncharacter.\n\nJoh. 11:11.-“Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ({6., is dead); but | go, that |\nmay awake him out of sleep”: i.e., raise him from the dead.\n\nAct. 2:39.-“For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all\nthat are afar off’: /.е., to the Gentiles. Peter did not wish at that time to\ngive unnecessary offence.\n\nThere are many other Euphemisms which require no explanation,\nand which the student will now readily note and mark for himself.',''),(118,118,'ampliatio','Gen. 2:23.-“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.”\nThough the bone and flesh of Adam were changed and made into\nEve, yet the name of the original source, “bone,” etc., is retained.\nExo. 7:12.-The rod of Aaron, when changed into a serpent, is still\ncalled “a rod” by way of Ampliatio.\n1Sa. 30:5. 2Sa. 3:3.-Abigail is still called, by way of Ampliatio, “the\nwife of Nabal the Carmelite,” though Nabal was dead, and she was\nthe wife of David.

So with the adjectives “wide” and “broad,” which are both\nto be emphasized.\n\nLuk. 16:11.-“Who will commit to your trust the true riches.”\nThe Hyperbaton (in the Greek) shows where the emphasis is to be\nplaced: “The true riches-who will entrust them to you.”\n\nJoh. 1:1.-Here the subject, “the Word,” being defined by the article\nwhich is prefixed to it, can be placed at the end of two of the clauses:\n“In the beginning was the Word, and God the Word was’: i.e., in plain\ncold English, “The Word was in the beginning ... and the Word was\nGod.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] preserves the Hyperbaton in the first clause, but\nnot in the last, because the English idiom will not bear it. But in each\ncase we are to put the stress on “the Word.”\n\nSee under Climax.\n\nJoh. 4:19.-The order of the words is, “Saith to him, the woman, Sir, |\nperceive that a prophet art thou”: thus emphasizing both the words\n“thou” and “prophet,” which should be greatly emphasized in reading.\nJoh. 4:24.-“А Spirit is God.”\nThe true emphasis is to be placed on the word “Spirit,” through its\nbeing placed (in the Greek) at the beginning of the sentence. In the\nordinary order, it would be placed after the subject. The two words are\ntransposed to call our attention to this great fact; as being the basis of\nthe Great Rubric which emphasizes the absolute necessity of our\nworship being truly spiritual.\n\nSee under Hendiadys.\n\nJoh. 6:60.-“Hard is this saying.”\n\nHere again the predicate is put first, and the object last, in order to\nemphasize both.\n\nJoh. 7:4.-“For no one in secret doeth anything and [at the same time]\nseeketh for it in public to be.”\n\nJoh. 9:31.-“Now we know that sinners-God does not hear.”\n\nJoh. 17:5.-“And now glorify me, Thou, Father, with Thyself, with the\nglory which | had, before the world was, with Thee.” Here, the\nmysterious depths of the words are forced upon our attention by the\nHyperbaton.\n\nThe force of it is weakened by the literalness of the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nAct. 17:23.-The true emphasis is here brought out by the Hyperbaton:\n“For passing through and beholding the objects of your worship, |\nfound an altar also, on which stood inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’\nWhat therefore, unknowing, ye reverence, this |-even I, announce to\nyou.”\n\nRom. 1:3.-“Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” Here, the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] entirely loses the emphasis of the Hyperbaton, by which the\nwords “Jesus Christ our Lord” in sense follow the words “His Son,” but\nare held back in suspense to the very end of the clause.\n\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] restores it, but we give\nour own rendering of this difficult passage (verses 1-4):-\n\n“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, by Divine calling an apostle (see\nEllipsis), separated unto God’s Gospel which He promised in former\ntimes through His prophets in Holy Scriptures: viz., the Gospel\nconcerning His Son, who was of David’s seed according to the flesh,\nbut was powerfully (© ™/\'=\'=’) demonstrated to be God’s Son with\nrespect to His holy spiritual nature, by His resurrection from the dead*\n[Note: Or “by a resurrection of dead persons”: viz., that referred to in\nMat. 27:52-53. See under Hysteresis and Heterosis.] (Psa. 2:1-12\nAct. 2:1-47), even Jesus Christ our Lord.”\nRom. 5:8.-Here the words are out of the natural order to excite our\nattention. The Greek is: “But commends His own love to us-God.”\nThe nominative is put last, and the verb first, to emphasize both.\nRom. 8:18.-“Not worthy are the sufferings of the present time\n[compared with] the coming glory, to be revealed.”\n\nHere, the emphasis is placed on the non-worthiness of the\nsufferings, and the nearness of the revelation of the glory.\n\nRom. 11:13.-“For to you | speak, to you Gentiles, inasmuch as | am\nof Gentiles the apostle.”\n\nHere the shades of emphasis can be traced in the unusual order of\nthe words in which fleshly wisdom can discern only “bad grammar”!\nThe first and last words are seen to be very emphatic.\n\nRom. 12:19.-How unusual to commence like this: “Not yourselves\navenging (or, be no self-avengers), beloved, but give place to [Divine]\nwrath,” thus emphasizing “yourselves.”\n\nRom. 14:1.-“Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not for\ndisputings of doubts”: {6., doubtful disputations, with emphasis on\ndoubtful:\n\n1Co. 3:9.-“For God’s fellow-workers, God’s husbandry, God’s\nbuilding ye.”\nThe emphasis is on “God’s”; and it is to be noted that it is we who\nare fellow-workers with one another; not with God, as though He were\none like ourselves. We are the fellow-workers with one another, and\nwe belong to God and work for Him.

It is a question whether it does not\nbelong to the writing of the names and not to the slaying of the\nLamb:-“Whose names are not written from the foundation of the world\nin the book of life of the Lamb slain.” As in 17:8.

It was after the birth\nof Joseph that Jacob wished to go away and leave Laban. In the first\nseven years were born Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali,\nand Joseph. Then he served seven more years (chap. 31:41), and in\nthese were born Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah.\nSo Joseph\'s birth, which took place after Naphtali’s, is recorded,\nby Hysterologia: after Dinah’s.\n\nGen. 38:1-30 -The history of Judah in this chapter is put by\nHysterologia, for the greater part of it took place before the selling of\nJoseph, which is recorded in chap. 37.\n\nJdg. 20:1-48; Jdg. 21:1-25.-These chapters describe the Benjamite\nwar; which must have taken place many years before; indeed soon\nafter Joshua’s death, though recorded here.

In chap. 16:1-13, David is anointed, and the Spirit of God comes\nupon him. Then, in order to contrast the Spirit of the Lord departing\nfrom Saul, a /ater fact is brought forward here (chap. 16:14-23), which,\nin the history, really follows chap. 18:9. So that chaps. 17-18:9 record\nan earlier event in David’s life, which is brought in here parenthetically,\ndescribing one of the illustrations of chap. 14:52, that, when Saul saw\nany strong man or any valiant man, he took him unto him. Chaps.\n17-18:9 go on to give an instance of this with David, and tell how Saul\nthus found David. Then (after chap. 18:9) we have to go back again to\nprior events (recorded in chap. 16:14-23); while, in chap. 18:10-30, we\nhave further facts concerning Saul’s “evil spirit” and other events of\nDavid\'s life.\n\nThe whole section is beautifully constructed; and the parentheses\nbetween the different members are clearly seen: each member being\nparenthetical to the other two, between which it is placed:-\n\nA@ 16:1-13. DAVID anointed. The Spirit of the Lord comes upon\n\nhim.\nB 14-23. SAUL rejected. The Spirit of the Lord departs from\nSaul, and an evil spirit troubles him.\n\nA™ 17:1-18:9. DAVID. An earlier incident in his life.\n\nBo 10-30. SAUL. The Spirit departed, and evil spirit troubling\nhim.\n\nSo that, while Sau/ and David alternate, we see why the special\narrangement is made; so as to bring out into contrast the facts\nrecorded in each pair of corresponding members, which are not\nrecorded in their historical order, but in the order of the spiritual\ninstruction which is to be conveyed. The historical order is obtained by\nreading on from A to A (treating B as being in a parenthesis); and then\nfrom B to B (treating A as though it were in a parenthesis); while the\nlogical sequence of the spiritual order is obtained by reading straight\non, as the history is written in the Text.\n\n2Sa. 23:1-39; 2Sa. 24:1-25.-The latter chapter is put after chapters 22\nand 23, which contain David’s “last song” and “last words,” while the\nevents really follow chap. 21. The “song” and the “words” follow more\nappropriately, immediately after the record of David’s mighty acts,\ninstead of after David\'s sin in numbering the People.\n\nIsa. 38:21-22.-Here, the sign which Hezekiah had asked for, in verse\n22, is described in verse 21, beautifully emphasizing the Divine over-\nruling of the history.\n\nAmo. 6:2.-The cities are put according to logical emphasis, rather\nthan geographical sequence.\nMat. 27:52-53.-Here, the events which took place later, are recorded\nin their consequential order, rather than in the actual historical order.\n\nAt the moment when the Lord Jesus “yielded up His Spirit ... the\nearth was shaken, and the rocks were rent, and the tombs were\nopened [and now comes, (by Hysterologia) “many bodies of the saints\nwho had fallen asleep, arose, and, coming forth out of the tombs after\nHis resurrection, entered into the holy city, and appeared privately*\n[Note: This seems to be the meaning of “Μιισηςκθὔη (emphanizein),\nsee its only other occurpevzes: НеВ_9:24; НеВ_11:14.] to many]. Now the\ncenturion, and those with him, keeping guard over Jesus-seeing the\nearthquake, and the things that were taking place-feared greatly,\nsaying, ‘Truly, God’s Son this Man was.’ ”\n\nIt is a question whether it be not this which is referred to in Rom.\n1:4 : where the Lord Jesus is said to have been marked out as “God’s\nSon ... as the result of raising (or rising) again of dead persons.” For it\nis not ΙΙ, from among the dead, but simply =), of dead\npeople. That He was so marked out is described in the history by the\nexclamation of the Centurion. In both cases we have «Ισ (without\narticles), “God’s Son.”\n\nSome have suggested that we have this figure in the record of the\ntemptation (Luk. 4:5; Luk. 4:9), where the temptation which seems to\ncome first in order of events is put last. Compare Mat. 4:5; Mat. 4:8.\nRev. 12:1-17 -In this chapter, we have the prophetic record of events,\nwhich shall take place before Chapter 6, and lead up to what is\nrecorded in chapters 6-11.\n\nChapters 6-11. give the exoteric view of the future history, which\nends with the judgment (chap. 11:18). Chap. 11:18 therefore brings us\nparallel to chap. 20. The Beast and false prophet are upon the earth\nduring this period, and their actions are seen in chaps. 9 and 11,\nthough they are not named, and their actual coming is not described,\ntill chap. 13.\n\nBut chapter 12 gives the esoteric view of the same period, and\ntakes us back to a point prior to chap. 6, and shows us the causes\nwhich shall lead to the rising up of the Beast and the false prophet.\n\nFirst, the war takes place in heaven, and the Devil is cast out into\nthe earth.\n\nThen “he” stands upon the sand of the sea (chap. 13:1, R.V. [Note:\nThe Revised Version, 1881.] ); and John sees these two awful beings\ncoming up, the one from the sea and the other from the earth. There is\nno record of their doings, except what is recorded in chaps. 6-11, and\nin 13.\n\nSee further under Ellipsis.',''),(126,126,'hysteresis','Gen. 31:7-8.-Jacob mentions later, certain facts in his history which\nhad taken place before.\n\n1Sa. 12:12.-A prior event is here recorded, not mentioned in the\nearlier narration.\n\n1Sa. 22:9-16.-Certain supplementary details are given here which are\nnot recorded in the account as narrated in chap. 21:1-9.\n\nPsa. 105:18.-“Whose feet they hurt with fetters.” This, by Hysteresis,\nis mentioned here, though not recorded in the history of Joseph in\nGenesis.\n\nHos. 12:3-5 gives further particulars supplementing the history in Gen.\n32:24, etc.; 28:12-19, and 35:9-15.\n\nAmo. 1:1.-A particular earthquake is here mentioned, of which no\nhistorical record is given. It is possibly the earthquake mentioned in\nZec. 14:5. Amos is said to have prophesied “in the days of Uzziah ...\nand Jeroboam”; and it is added, “two years before the earthquake.”\nNow, in Zechariah, we have no mention of Jeroboam. Hence it is very\npossible that, by the time the earthquake took place, he was dead.\nHow Amos came to be “among the herdmen from Tekoa’; or, why\nthese men migrated, as it may seem, into Israelite territory, we are not\ntold. But if we take the mysterious “it,”* [Note: Which is masc. in all the\neight occurrences: and always followed by the great pause.] which\nthe Lord, by Amos, says, He will not “avert,” to be this very\nearthquake, we avoid a very puzzling Ellipsis, and shall very likely be\ncorrect.\nAmo. 2:1.-Moab is here said to have “burned the bones of the king of\nEdom into lime,” a fact of which we have no historical mention. Mesha,\nking of Moab, evidently was a cruel man. In his superstitions he\noffered his own son upon the wall, and turned the tide of battle.\n\nSee further information concerning this in the history of The\nMoabite Stone.\nAmo. 5:25-26.-Here we learn the names of certain of the gods which\nthe Children of Israel worshipped in the wilderness. See also Eze.\n20:6-7; Eze. 20:18; Eze. 20:22, etc.\nZec. 14:5.-See above under Amo. 1:1.\nMat. 2:23.-“And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it\nmight be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be\ncalled a Nazarene.”\n\nThrough missing this Hysteresis, the commentators have created\na difficulty of their own.\n\nFirst, they cannot find such a prophecy in any of the prophets.\n\nThen, they try and make a connection between neizer, a branch,\nand Nazarene; and, as there is none, the difficulty is only increased.\n\nEven if the connection could be established, the difficulty would not\nbe removed: for it says “prophets” (p/ura/), and the word neizer is used\nof Christ in only one prophet, Isaiah. So the difficulty is further\nincreased.\n\nBut there is really no difficulty at all. It is absolutely created. It is\nassumed from the outset that it says “which was written.” But it does\nnot say so! It says “which was SPOKEN.” The fact is, some\nprophecies were written down and never spoken; some were both\nwritten and spoken; while others were spoken and never written. This\nis one of the latter class: and there is all the difference in the world\nbetween 132 \\\\ (to rheethen), which was spoken, and ο ! (ло\ngegraptai), which standeth written!\nThus, this beautiful Hysteresis reveals to us the historical fact that\nseveral prophets had declared by the Holy Spirit that the Messiah\nshould be called a Nazarene. But for this Hysteresis we should never\nhave known it.\n\nMat. 23:35-36.-“That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed\nupon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of\nZacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and\nthe altar.” etc.\n\nNow, from failing to see the historical Hysteresis here, it has been\nhastily assumed that the reference is to 2Ch. 24:20-21, where we\nread, “The Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the\npriest ... And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones\nat the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord.”\n\nBy this inaccurate reference, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of\nGod, is charged with making a serious mistake.\n\nBut note that when the Lord says that Zachariah was “the son of\nBarachias,” He could not possibly have been speaking of “the son of\nJehoiada” as the same man.\n\nIf He began with Abel, the first martyr, it is not probable He would\nend with a murder which took place 870 years before he spoke the\nwords, when there were many more during those 870 years.\n\nHow much more probable that he referred to Zechariah the (last\nbut one) prophet (and the one of whom he is speaking, verse 31), who\ndied some 500 years before the Lord spoke the words? Moreover, he\nis expressly called “the son of Berechiah” in Zec. 1:1; Zec. 1:7.\n\nIt is remarkable that there was another Zechariah, the son of\nBaruch, who was martyred some 36 years afterward (a.d. 69),\nimmediately before the destruction of Jerusalem, as recorded by\nJosephus (Wars, iv. 5, 4).\n\nMat. 27:9-10.-See under Gnome.\n\nAct. 9:1-43; xxii.; xxvi.-In the three accounts of the conversion of\nSaul, we have supplementary facts, disconnected from the historical\nevent.\n\n2Ti. 3:8.-“Jannes and Jambres” are named as two of the Egyptian\nwise men; whose names are not given in Exodus, but are supplied\nhere by the Holy Spirit.\n\nHeb. 9:19.-The sprinkling of the book is supplementary information\nwhich is not given in Exo. 24:1-18\n\nHeb. 11:21.-Here we have an additional fact, which at once explains\nand amplifies Gen. 48:12, and is not in discrepancy with Gen. 47:31,\nas is commonly supposed.\n\nWe must give the whole of this verse, because of the controversies\nwhich have raged around it: “By faith, Jacob, when he was a dying,\nMessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, /eaning upon the\ntop of his staff.”\n\nThe marginal reference in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,\nor current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] is Gen. 47:31; but this,\nthough followed by every one, is certainly not correct. The\ncircumstance in Heb. 11:21 is Jacob’s blessing of the sons of Joseph,\nwhich is set in company with Isaac’s blessing of his own sons. The\ntwo together giving the beautiful lesson that Isaac’s blessing was\ngiven contrary to the will of the flesh (i.e., his own will), while Jacob\'s\nblessing was given contrary to the will of man (i.e., Joseph’s will)\n(Heb. 11:20-21).\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that the whole emphasis of the reference is to\nthe occasion of the blessing: of which there is not a word in Gen.\n47:31, and to which it does not refer.\n\nIn Gen. 47:31, Jacob was causing Joseph to swear that he would\nbury him not in Egypt, but in the land of Canaan, and “Israel bowed\nhimself upon the bed,s head.”\nBut it was “after these things” (Gen. 48:1), that the blessing of\nJoseph and his sons took place. And, then, we have, in chap. 48:12,\nthe worship of Jacob who “bowed himself with his face to the earth.”\nJacob must, therefore, have been in a sitting posture; for, in verse 2,\nwe read that when they told him that Joseph was approaching, “Israel\nstrengthened himself, and sat upon the bed”; and, from verse 12,\nwhen he embraced Ephraim and Manasseh, he took them “between\nhis knees.” It was then, we gather that, in the blessing of his own sons\n(for chaps. 48 and 49 are continuous), that he “leaned on the top of\nhis staff.” And this inspired addition to the information is given us in\nHeb. 11:21, to enhance and emphasize his faith, and to indicate\nIsrael\'s extreme infirmity, for it was his last dying act (chap. 49:33).\n\nThere is no necessity, therefore, for us to discuss the question of\nthe various reading involved in the Hebrew ica (mittah), the bed, and\nthe LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] and Syriac\nrendering, the staff, which would require the Hebrew to be pointed\niéa (matteh). Had the word been used in the Hebrew of Gen.\n48:1-22, the true pointing would have been there decided.*|Note: Had\na Staff been intended in Gen. 47:31, it would probably have been\n22 (makkail), as in chaps, 30:37; 32:10, etc.] But the point is\ndecided for us in Heb. 11:21; which clearly states that it was his “staff”\nthat Israel leaned upon while worshipping God and blessing “by faith”\nthe sons of Joseph. We must, however, point out “the incalculable\nquantity of idolatrous nonsense,” to use the words of Dean Alford (in\nloco), which (he says) “has been written on these words by Roman\nCatholic commentators, taking as their starting point the rendering of\nthe Vulgate: et adoravit fastigium virgae ejus [and worshipped the top\nof his staff], and thence deriving an argument for the worship of\nimages”! This corruption of the Vulgate is perpetuated in all the\nRomish translations of it; and all therefore come under the Dean’s\nvigorous condemnation.\n\nHeb. 12:21 gives a particular which we do not find recorded in Exo.\n19:1-25 and xx.\n\nJam. 5:17.-The earnest prayer of Elijah is not recorded in 1Ki. 17:1.\nJud. 1:9 mentions by the Holy Spirit the contention of Satan about the\nbody of Moses; and, in verse 14, some words of a prophecy of Enoch.\nTrading on this reference, men have forged “the book of Enoch”\nevolving its fancies and trivialities out of this historical Hysteresis.',''),(127,127,'simultaneum','Mar. 15:12-14.-Where Pilate’s words (verses 12, 14) are interrupted\nby the shouts of the People (verse 13).

Now, if we\ndied with Christ, we believe that we shall live also with him.”\nRom. 8:5.-“For they that are (or live) after (or according to) flesh (the\nOld nature) do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are (or live)\nafter (according to) spirit (the New nature) [do mina] the things of the\nspirit”: i.e., the things that belong to the New nature. See under\nMetonymy.\nRom. 8:13.-“For if ye live according to flesh, ye shall die: but if ye\nthrough spirit (the New nature) do mortify the deeds of the body ({6.,\nby reckoning that it died with Christ, Rom. 6:11), ye will live.”\nRom. 15:12.-“There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise\n[and raise His banner] to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the\nGentiles trust.” The reference is to Isa. 11:10 : where ai (neys), a\nbanner, which is raised aloft, is put in contrast with the “roof” which is\nthe lowest point. So Messiah rises from the lowest to the highest.\n2Co. 4:17-18 contains several beautiful Antitheses.\n2Co. 6:8-10 contains a series of beautiful Antitheses.\nIn 2Co. 6:4-5 -, we have a seven-fold passive experience:-\n\npatience,\n\nafflictions,\n\nnecessities,\n\ndistresses,\n\nstripes,\n\nimprisonments,\n\ntumults\n\nIn 20ο. 6:5-6-, we have a seven-fold self-denial:\n\nlabours,\n\nwatchings,\n\nfastings,\n\npureness,\nknowledge,\n\nlongsuffering.\n\nkindness.\n\nIn 20ο. 6:6; 20ο. 6:8 -, we have a seven-fold means to елаиге:-\n\nthe Holy Ghost,\n\nlove unfeigned,\n\nthe word of truth,\n\nthe power of God,\n\nthe armour of righteousness,\n\nhonour and dishonour,\n\nevil report and good report.\n\nIn 2Co. 6:8-10, we have a seven-fold result in the following\n\nAntitheses:—\n\ndeceivers, and yet true;\n\nunknown, yet well-known;\n\ndying, yet living;\n\nchastened, yet not killed;\n\nsorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;\n\npoor, yet enriching others;\n\nhaving nothing, yet possessing all things.\nPhp. 3:7.-“But what things were gain to me, those | counted loss for\nChrist.”\n\nNote that, by Antithesis, our attention is called to the fact that Paul\nis here speaking, by the Spirit, of his “gains,” not of his sins. Of his\ngains, as a man and an Israelite; which included the hope of\nresurrection as well as righteousness, of course: but he was willing to\ngive them all up for that righteousness which he had in Christ, and for\nthat “out-rising from among the dead,” which he should have at\nChrist\'s appearing.\n\nHe does not, in verse 11, speak of something which he could attain\nto as a Christian more than other Christians; but he is contrasting his\n“gains,” as a Jew, and putting them in Antithesis with his greater gains\nas a Christian.\n2Pe. 2:19.-“While they promise them (i.e. their dupes) liberty, they\nthemselves are the servants of corruption.”',''),(129,129,'enantiosis','Psa. 1:1.-We have here a beautiful series of affirmation by contraries.\nIsa. 45:22.-“I am God, and there is none else.”\n\nLuk. 7:44-46.-The difference between reality and formality is\nbeautifully shown by a series of contrasts which are affirmatives by\ncontraries.\n\nRom. 8:15.-“For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to\nfear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption (or a sonship-spirit),\nwhereby we cry, “Abba, Father.”\n\nPhp. 3:9.-“And be found in him (Christ), not having mine own\nrighteousness, which is of the law, but that [righteousness] which is\nthrough the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”',''),(130,130,'anacoluthon','1. Sometimes the accusative stands alone at the beginning of a\nsentence\nThis is not an “accusative absolute,” but is to be rendered “as for” or\n“as to.”\nLuk. 21:6.-Here, the Lord says: “These things which ye behold”: and\nthen He turns off, and says: “There will come days.” So that we must\nsupply the words “As to” these things, etc.\n\nAct. 10:36.-Here, again, the sentence begins with the accusative:\n“The word which He sent unto the children of Israel.” Some MSS., not\nunderstanding the Anacoluthon, omit the relative pronoun “which.” But\nthe sense is “As touching the word which He hath sent,” etc. Or it may\ndepend on ©\" =, ye know, in the next verse: “Ye know the word\nwhich He sent,” etc.\n\nRom. 8:3.-“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through\nthe flesh.” Here, the argument breaks off to speak of what God has\ndone: “God (by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and\nas an offering for sin) did: namely, “He condemned sin in the flesh in\norder that the righteous-requirement (‘| “, dikai?ma) of the Law\nmight be fulfilled in us who walk not according to flesh (i.e., the Old\nnature), but according to spirit ({:6., the New nature).”\n\nThe figure requires the conclusion-this thing was impossible for the\nLaw to do, because it was weak through the flesh: i.e., man, owing to\nthe corruption of his nature, could not keep the Law; and the Law was\npowerless, because it could neither pardon the trangressor, nor alter\nhis nature. This defect was overcome by God, Who condemned sin in\nthe death of His Son (who was the sin-offering personified). His\nPeople, therefore, having died with Him, are discharged from the\nclaims of the Law; and, being now “in Christ,” fulfil in Him all its\nrighteous requirements.\n2. Sometimes the leading proposition is interrupted by a\nparenthesis, and, when the subject is resumed, the grammatical\nconnection is changed\nJoh. 6:22-24.\n\nGal. 2:6-7.\n\n3. Sometimes the construction suddenly changes (without a\npaten. thesis) by a change of persons; or, from participles to\nfinite verbs; or, from singular to plural, and vice versa\nMar. 6:11.-“And whosoever shall not receive you ... shake off the dust\n\nof your feet against them.”\nHere, the Anacoluthon is seen only when we take the Critical Text\napproved by T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his critical Greek Text.] Tr.\n[Note: r. Tregelles and his critical Greek Text.] A. [Note: . Alford and\nhis critical Greek Text.] WH. [Note: H. Westcott and Hort, and their\ncritical Greek Text.] ‚ and Ι.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nviz., 1 |\\9\\) (hos an topos), whatsoever place (singular), instead of ©\n\n2 (hosoi an) whosoever or as many as (plural). So that the\nAnacoluthon is: “And whatsoever place (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular\nNumber-.] ) will not receive you ... shake off the dust of your feet\nagainst them.”\n\nLuk. 11:11.-“From which of you, the father, shall his son ask bread?\nWill he give him a stone?”\n\nHere the plural “you” is broken off for the singular “he.”\n1Со. 7:13.-“And the woman which hath an husband that believeth\nnot, and if he be pleased to dwell with her,” etc.\n\nHere the break is from the feminine to the masculine.\n2Co. 5:6; 2Co. 5:8.-Here the change is from participles to finite verbs:\n\n“Being confident then always, and conscious that being at home\n[here] in the body, we are from home, away from the Lord (for by faith\nwe are walking, not by sight). We are confident, however, and are\ncontent rather to be from home [here] out of the body, and to be at\nhome with the Lord [there].”\nThese words are usually misquoted “absent from the body, present\nwith the Lord,” as though it meant that the moment we are absent from\nthe body we are present with the Lord. But this is exactly what it does\nnot say: and the Anacoluthon calls our attention to this.\n\nThe whole subject is resurrection, starting from 4:14. Our two\nbodies are contrasted in 5:1-5: viz.: “the earthly house of this\ntabernacle (i.e., this mortal body)’ is contrasted with “our 9 |=)\n(oikeeteerion), our spiritual or resurrection body” (see Jud. 1:6): viz.:\n“our house which is from heaven,” the future body of glory being called\na “house,” as compared with the present body in which we groan,\nwhich is called a “tabernacle” or tent.\n\nThe argument is that, while we are in this “tabernacle” we cannot\nhave that “house”; and that while we are in this tent we are away from\nour real eternal home, which is with the Lord.\n\nThere is no thought (here or elsewhere) of our being at home, or\n“with the Lord,” apart from resurrection and our resurrection bodies.\nGal. 6:1.-“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are\nspiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering\nthyself, lest thou also be tempted.”\n\nHere the abrupt transition from the plural to the singular, which is a\nkind of Enallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), makes the general precept\napplicable to each individual, in order to emphasize the absolute\nnecessity of the “spirit of meekness’” which is enjoined.\nThe figure calls our attention also to the fact that restoration is the\nobject, and not judgment. Experience would lead us to believe that the\ntext read: “Ye which are spiritual judge such an one in the spirit of\nbitterness and harshness, not considering thyself!” Hence the use of\nthis figure to arrest our attention, and correct our error.\n\nEph. 1:20.-“Having raised him ... he set him.”\nCol. 1:26.-“The secret which had been lying hid from the ages and\nfrom the generations, but lately was made manifest to his Saints.”\n\nOther examples may be found, e.g.:-\n\nChange from first person to the second: Gal. 3:25-26; Gal. 4:5-6;\nGal. 4:20.\n\nChange from second person to the first: Eph. 2:2-3; Eph. 2:13-14;\nEph. 4:31-32; Eph. 5:2 (textual reading). Col. 1:10-13; Col. 3:3-4. 1Th.\n5:5.\nChange from second person plural to singular: Rom. 12:16-20.\n1Co. 4:6-7. Gal. 4:6-7.\n\nChange from third person to second: Jam. 2:16.\n4. Sometimes the construction is broken off altogether, andis not\n\ncompleted at all\n\nMar. 11:32.-“But if we shall say, Of men;-they feared the people.”\n\nHere, the reasonings of the rulers are broken off, and the sense\nmust be supplied by Ellipsis (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]).\nRom. 5:12.-This is usually given as an example of what appears to be\nan Anacoluthon; because the sense seems broken off at the end of\nverse 12: but the structure of the passage shows us the connection,\nand where the sense or argument is resumed. Many suppose that this\nis verse 15; but the Correspondence of subjects shows that it must be\nverse 18.\n\nThe section to which verse 12 belongs is that from verse 12 to 21,\nand is as follows:-\n\nThe structure of Rom. 5:12-21.\nA а220 12. By one man, sin: then, death upon all.\nΡ: 13. Sin not imputed where no Law exists.\n20 14. The reign of death.\nBo 15. Not as the offence, so the gracious gift.\nBo 16, 17. Not as by one person, so the gift.\n\nA ассо 18, 19. By one man’s offence, all men under\ncondemnation; by one man’s disobedient act the many were\nconstituted sinners; and the counterpart.\n\n6°29 20. The offence abounded when Law came-and the\ncounterpart.\n029 21. The reign of sin-and the counterpart.\n\nHere, we see that verse 12 corresponds with verses 18, 19, and\nconsequently all between (viz., verses 13-17) is practically in a\nparenthesis. Moreover, note that the three members of A are stated\nwith their counterparts, and are thus distinguished from the three in A.\n[Note: . Alford and his critical Greek Text.]\n1Ti. 1:3-4.-Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] supplies the sense by adding “so do.”\nThe R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] adds “so do / now.”\n\n5. Sometimes the change consists of a sudden transition from\nthe indirect to the direct form of speech\nMar. 6:9.-“But being shod with sandals; and put not on two coats.\nLuk. 5:14.-“Не charged him to tell no man, but go and show thyself,”\netc.\nThis may be explained by the Ellipsis of the verb “say,” “but [he\n\nsaid] go and show thyself,” etc.\nJoh. 5:44.-“How can ye believe, receiving honour one from another?\nand the honour that is only from God, ye seek not.”\nAct. 1:4.-“Wait for the Father’s promise which ye heard of me.” The\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] treat this\nas Ellipsis, supplying the words “which [saith or said he] ye have\nheard of me.”\nAct. 17:3.-“Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have\nsuffered and have risen from among the dead, and that this is the\nChrist whom I announce to you.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] (and A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] margin) treat this as Ellipsis, “whom\n[said he] | preach,” etc.\n\n6. Sometimes the change is from the direct form, which passes\ninto the indirect\nJoh. 13:29.-“Buy those things that we have need of against the feast;\nor, that he should give something to the poor.”\nAct. 14:22.- “Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them\nto continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations must we\nenter into the Kingdom of God.”\nSee under Ellipsis-\nAct. 23:23.-“Get ready two hundred soldiers that they may go to\nCrsarea.” The natural sequence would have been “and go.”\n7. Sometimes two equivalent constructions are united in the\nsame proposition\nIt is scarcely necessary to present these in full. The student can\nreadily search them out for himself.\n\nSee Mar. 6:7; Mar. 12:38. Rom. 12:4. 1Co. 14:5. Eph. 5:27; Eph.\n5:33.\n\nAnd in the Old Testament the following may be noticed:-\n\nGen. 35:3. Jos. 23:16. Jdg. 16:24. Neh. 10:30.\n13\" р. ΙΙΙ. Affecting the Application of Words\"\n\nIl. AFFECTING THE APPLICATION OF\nWORDS\n\nWe now come to the last class of the three great divisions of figurative\nlanguage, viz., figures which involve the Application of words rather\nthan their Meaning or Order.\nThese we propose to consider under those that have to do with\nchange; not that there is any real or absolute change; but because\nthere is a deviation or change from the literal, or from the more\nordinary and usual application of words. This change is brought about\nand prompted by some internal action of the mind, which seeks to\nimpress its intensity of feeling upon others. The meaning of the words\nthemselves continues to be literal: the figure lies in the application of\nthe words. This application arises from some actual resemblance\nbetween the words, or between two or more mental things which are\nbefore the mind.\n\nWhen the literal application of the words is contrary to ordinary\nplain human experience, or to the nature of the things themselves,\nthen we are compelled to regard the application as figurative, though\nthe words themselves still retain their literal meaning; otherwise, the\napplication would lose all its force and all its point.\n\nThe first three important figures in this class should be studied\ntogether: viz.: Simile (comparison by Resemblance), Metaphor\n(comparison by Representation), and Hypocatastasis (comparison by\nImplication), because they are like three degrees of comparison in the\nemphasis conveyed by the inter-relation of words апа their\napplication. They are the positive, comparative, and superlative\ndegrees of relation between words and thoughts.\n\nIn conforming to the order in which we are presenting these\nFigures of language, we lose much that would elucidate and bring out\nthe beauties of these three. They would each gain in force and\nemphasis if we were to combine them in one chapter and under one\nhead.\n\nEven if we could present the passages out of the order of the\nbooks of the Bible, one could be made to lead on and up to another,\nso as to enhance the general effect and force of the subject.\n\nBut we proceed on the lines we have laid down, and consider the\nApplication of words.',''),(131,131,'simile','Psa. 1:3.-“He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.” Here,\nthe similitude tells us that the man who meditates in God’s word is\nplanted and protected, just as a tree in a garden is cared for as a “tree\nof the field” is not.\n\nSee under Ellipsis, page 97.\n\nPsa. 1:4.-“The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the\nwind driveth away.” The contrast between the driven chaff and the\n“planted” tree is most striking and solemn.\n\nThe two comparisons are the great features of the Psalm, the\nstructure of which is as follows:-\n\nA а — 1. The godly blessed in not standing among the ungodly.\n\nЬ 2, 3-. Comparison (2? 22). “Like a tree.”\nο -3. Prosperity.\nA ο — 4-. The Contrary: “not so.”\nЬ — -4. Comparison (22 22). “Like the chaff.”\nа 5. The ungodly punished in not standing among the godly.\n\nThen the last verse stands out alone in solemn grandeur as giving\nthe reason for the whole.\nPsa. 5:12 (13).-“With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.”\nAnd why is His “favour” (i.e., His grace, which is favour to the\nunworthy) like a shield? Because “in his favour is life,” Psa. 30:5 (6);\nbecause in His favour there is mercy (Isa. 60:10); because in His\nfavour there is preservation (Psa. 86:2, margin); because in His favour\nthere is security, Psa. 41:11 (12): and therefore the prayer of all such\nfavoured ones will ever be Psa. 106:4.\nPsa. 17:8.-“Keep me as the apple of the eye [is kepf].”\n\nPsa. 131:2.-\"| have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is\nweaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.”\n\nMat. 7:24-27.-Here we have a magnificent and extended Simile,\nalmost amounting to a parable. It is too long to quote, and too plain to\nneed elucidation. It explains to us very clearly and forcibly its own\npowerful lesson.\n\nMat. 9:36.-“They ... were scattered abroad as sheep having no\nshepherd.\n\n1Pe. 2:25.-“Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto\nthe Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.”\n\nHere we have Simile, which stands in marked contrast to the\nProverb in 2Pe. 2:22, as to the “sow.” Both the stray sheep and the\nwashed sow “return.” But the one returns to the shepherd, and the\nother to the mire. We may note also that the verb “returned” as used\nof the “sheep” is the passive form; while, as used of the “sow,” it is the\nactive form. Showing that the “sheep” is made to return by a\nconstraining power, while the “sow” returns of its own act and free-will.\nSee under Paroemia.\nSometimes a Simile is really used as a figure, implying not\nmerely a resemblance but the actual thing itself.\n\nGen. 25:31.-“Sell me as on this day (2222, kayy6m)’: i.e., on this\nvery day. See, too, verse 33.\nNum. 11:1.-The Heb. reads: “And when the People was as\nmurmurers, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah.”\n\nHere the resemblance was real: i.e., they were murmurers.\nNeh. 7:2.-“I gave my brother Hanani ... charge over Jerusalem: for he\nacted as a faithful man (2222), etc.”: {Θ., he was a faithful man.\nIsa. 1:7.-“It is desolate as the overthrow of strangers.” See A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nmargin.\n\nSee under Antimereia, and compare Isa. 13:6.\nIsa. 1:9.-“Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small\nremnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been\nlike unto Gomorrah.”\n\nHere the words of the godly remnant declare the resemblance;\nand in the next verse Jehovah endorses it as true; addressing the\nungodly but most religious nation actually as “the rulers of Sodom”\nand “the people of Gomorrah.”\n\nPsa. 122:3.-“Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together’:\nie., it was a city so built.\n\nHos. 5:10.-“The princes of Judah were like them that remove the\nbound”: i.e., they actually committed this sin, the greatness of which is\nseen from Deu. 19:14; Deu. 27:17.\n\nMat. 14:5.-“Because they counted him as a prophet”: i.e., as actually\na prophet.\n\nLuk. 22:44.-“His sweat was as it were great drops of blood”: i.e., it\nwas.\n\nJoh. 1:14.-“And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten\nof the Father”: i.e., the glory of Him who was really the only begotten\nSon of the Father.\n\nRom. 9:32.-“Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it\nwere (i.e., actually) by the works of the law.”\n\n2Co. 2:17.-“We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but\nas of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ”:\ni.eé., we speak really and truly sincere, pure, and Divine words.\n2Co. 3:18.-“We are all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror\n(κατοτπριζόµενοι, katoptrizomenoi) the glory of the Lord, are trans-\nfigured to the same image, from glory to glory, even as from the Lord-\nthe Spirit’: ie., really by the actual operation of the Holy Spirit. His\noffice is to glorify Christ; and those who are led by the Spirit do occupy\nthemselves with Christ-the heavenly object, and thus become like\nHim, heavenly, and that without an effort. Indeed, the measure in\nwhich we are “filled with the Spirit” is the measure in which we are\nthus occupied with Christ.\n\nSometimes the word “as” is followed by the word “so,” to\nstrengthen and heighten the comparison, and make it more clear:\nasin\nIsa. 24:2.-“And it shall be\nAs with the people,\n\nSo with the priest;\nAs with the servant,\nSo with his master;\nAs with the maid,\nSo with her mistress;\nAs with the buyer,\nSo with the seller;\nAs with the lender,\nSo with the borrower;\nAs with the taker of usury,\nSo with the giver of usury to him.”\nAnd all this to show the universality of the judgment which shall\nmake the land empty and desolate.\nThis is a combination of Syncrisis with this form of Simile.\nIsa. 55:10, 11.-\nа “As the rain cometh down, and the snow\nЬ — Ргот heaven,\nс And returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and\nmaketh it bring forth and bud,\n@Я — That it may give seed to the sower, and bread to\nthe eater.\n\nа — So shall my word be that goeth forth\n\nЬ Out of my mouth:\nο Itshall not return unto me void,\nа Βιΐ it shall accomplish that which | please, and it\nshall prosper in the thing whereto | sent it.”\n\nHere, in this beautiful comparison, we have in a and a the two\nthings compared, the Word resembling the rain and snow; in b and b\nwe have their source; in c and c, their destiny, not returning void; and\nin d and d, their end prospering, end the accomplishment of their\nmission.\n\n“AS” and “SO.”\n\nWe have collected a number of these examples of the use of “as”\nand “so” together; and arranged them, not in the sequence of the\nbooks of the Bible, or in full; but we have numbered them and placed\nthem so as to illustrate the ways of God in grace:-\n\n1. Sin and death (Rom. 5:12). These words explain the mystery\nof the first and last Adam, and the first and second man: their\ntemptation and its results as shown in Gen. 3:1-24, Mat.\n4:1-25, and Rom. 6:23. This explains\n\n2. Offence and righteousness: judgment and free gift (Rom.\n5:18); also\n\n3. Disobedience and obedience: sinners and righteous (Rom.\n5:19). Hence the eternal results of\n\n4. Sin and death: grace and eternal life (Rom. 5:21).\n\nNow we pass from sin and its entrance and consequences to\n\n5. — № remedy. The Serpent and the Son of Man (Joh. 3:14). Note\nthe two “musts” (verses 7 and 14); and the parabolic miracle of\nNum. 21:5-9. Note the ‘lifting up” spoken of in Joh. 12:32. The\n“all” means all without distinction (no longer the one People of\nIsrael) not “all” without exception.\n\nIn due time Christ came to be thus “lifted up,” and\n\n6. do the Father’s will, and Commandment, and He did (Joh.\n14:31), and\n\n7. suffered; Lamb dumb, and so He; etc. (Isa. 53:7). Hence\n8. Once to die, and once offered (Heb. 9:27-28).\n\nThen\n\n9. they are sent, “Sent Me” and “sent them” (Joh. 17:18)\n\n10. to bear testimony of His grace: “Believed” and “done” (Mat.\n8:13),\n\n11. yea, of His life-giving grace: Life (Joh. 5:26).\n\n12. God reveals Himself. Heaven and earth; ways and thoughts\n(Isa. 55:9), and\n\n13. man, morally: Foolish as a beast (Psa. 73:22).\n\n14. Fathers and sons, etc., ye (Act. 7:51); and\n15. physically, the Flower that flourisheth (Psa. 103:15).\n\nThen He reveals\n\n16. His mercy: Heaven high and mercy great (Psa. 103:11),\n\n17. His forgiveness: East from west and trangressions removed\n(Psa. 103:12),\n\n18. His pity: A father and the Lord (Psa. 103:13), and\n\n19. His love: The Father and | (Joh. 15:9).\n\nThen He reveals\n\n20. our relationships and duties: Many members and one body\n(Rom. 12:4; see 1Co. 12:12-13).\n\n21. Mutual forgiveness: Christ forgave and do ye (Col. 3:13),\n\n22. Christ-like walk: Received and walk ye (Col. 2:6).\n\n23. Divine consolations: Sufferings and consolation (2Co. 1:5;\n2Co. 1:7).\n\n24. Missionary work: Received and minister (1Ре. 4:10); with\n25. the Divine promise, Rain and snow: the word of God (Isa.\n55:10-11); and\n\n26. the Divine support, Thy days and thy strength (Deu. 33:25).\n\nOh may our desire to do His will be according to,\n\n27. The hart panting, and the soul longing (Psa. 42:1 (2)).\n\nThe JEW.\n\n28. All blessing based on God\'s original covenant-promise; Stars\nand seed (Jer. 33:22), see especially Gen. 15:5, and Rom.\n4:18. The covenant of works they brake, see Exo. 24:3; Exo.\n24:7 and Jer. 31:32, and are now suffering the consequences.\n\n29. The future blessing of Israel will be under the original\ncovenant, of grace: as Mother comforteth, so will | comfort (Isa.\n66:13).\n\n30. Bridegroom and thy God (Isa. 62:5).\n\n31.

We must not separate what God has joined\ntogether, nor join together what God has separated (Mat. 19:6). The\nJew, the Gentile, and the Church of God, are distinct in their calling,\nstanding, hope, and destiny (1Co. 10:32). The preaching of the\nGospel is not to convert the world, but to take out a People (Act.\n15:14); while the world will get worse and worse until Christ suddenly\ncomes.\n\n33. Lightning, and coming (Mat. 24:27).\n\n34. The days of Noah, and the coming of the Son of Man (Mat.\n\n24:37-39).\n\nThe CHURCH OF GOD. Christ\'s advent will wear a different\naspect to the Church. Not like the lightning or a thief, but\n\n35. “this same Jesus.” As ye have seen Him go will so come (Act.\n\n1:11). Christ’s resurrection is the type and pledge of ours.\n36. As all in Adam die, so all in Christ made alive (1Co. 15:22).\nNote the “order” (verses 23 and 24).',''),(132,132,'syncrisis','Isa. 1:18.-\n“Though your sins be as scarlet,\nThey shall be as white as snow;\nThough they be red like crimson,\nThey shall be as wool.”\n\nIsa. 32:2.-“And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, anda\ncovert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the\nshadow of a great rock in a weary land.”\n\nIsa. 66:12.-“For thus saith the Lord, Behold, | will extend peace to her\nlike a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream.”',''),(133,133,'metaphor','Psa. 23:1.-“The Lord is my Shepherd.” Here, we have a Metaphor;\nand in it a great and blessed truth is set forth by the representation of\nJehovah as a Shepherd. It is He who tends his People, and does\nmore for them than any earthly shepherd does for his sheep All His\ntitles and attributes are so bound up with this care that in this Psalm\nwe have the illustration of all the Jehovah-titles:-\n\nIn verse 1. “I shall not want,” because He is Jehovah-Jireh (Gen.\n22:14), and will provide.\nIn verse 2. “He leadeth me beside the waters of quietness\n(margin), because He is Jehovah-Shalom (Jdg. 6:24), and will give\npeace.\n\nIn verse 3. “He restoreth my soul,” for He is Jehovah-Rophecha\n(Exo. 15:26), and will graciously heal.\n\nIn verse 3. He guides me “in the paths of righteousness,” for He is\nJehovah-tzidkenu (Jer. 23:6), and is Himself my righteousness, and |\nam righteous in Him (Jer. 33:16).\n\nIn verse 4. In death’s dark valley “Thou art with me,” for thou art\nJehovah-shammah (Eze. 48:35), and the Lord is there.\n\nIn verse 5. “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of\nmine enemies,” for Thou art Jehovah-nissi (Exo. 17:15), my banner,\nand will fight for me, while | feast.\n\nIn verse 5. “Thou anointest my head with oil,” for Thou art\nJehovah-mekaddeschem (Exo. 31:13, etc.), the Lord that sanctifieth\nme.\nIn verse 6. “Surely” all these blessings are mine for time and\n\neternity, for He is Jehovah-rohi (Psa. 23:1), Jehovah my Shepherd,\npledged to raise me up from the dead, and to preserve and bring me\n“through” the valley of death into His glorious kingdom (Joh. 6:39).\nPsa. 84:11 (12).-“The Lord God is a Sun and Shield.” Here, the\nMetaphor is taken from the uses and effects of the two things\nmentioned. He is my light and my defence. See P.B.V. [Note: .B.V. The\nPrayer Book Version of the Psalms (from Coverdale’s Bible).]\nPsa. 91:4.-“His truth is a shield and a buckler” (R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] ). Here, we have the Metaphor, by which the\none thing is carried over and stated as being the other. In Psa. 5:12,\nwe have the same fact stated literally as a Simile. See page 728\nabove.\n\nMetaphors are so numerous in the Old Testament, that it is\n\nimpossible to give more than these few to serve as specimens and\nexamples. We add a few from the New Testament.\nMat. 5:13.-“Ye are the salt of the earth”: i.e., ye are (or represent) with\nregard to the earth what salt is to other things, preserving it from total\ncorruption and destruction; just as the few righteous in Sodom would\nhave preserved that city.\nWhen the Lord Jesus shall have returned and caught up His\nPeople (the salt) to meet Him in the air and to be for ever with Him,\nthen the corruption will proceed apace, and the harvest of the earth\nspeedily be ripened for judgment.\n\nMat. 26:26.-“This is my body” (τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ σῶμά µου, touto esti to\n56/18 mou).\n\nFew passages have been more perverted than these simple\nwords. Rome has insisted on the literal or the figurative sense of\nwords just as it suits her own purpose, and not at all according to the\nlaws of philology and the true science of language.\n\nHence the Latin idiom, “agere poenitentiam,” repent, has been\nrendered literally in all her versions from the Vulgate, in various\nlanguages, “do penance,” except when God is said to repent! Rome\ndared not translate agere poenitentiam literally in these cases, which\nproves her design in thus systematically perverting the Word of God:\nand the false doctrine is thus forced into the words under a show or\nsemblance of literal translation.* [Note: Rome would not dare to\ntranslate the same Latin idiom “agere vitam,” to do life, though the\nexpression has passed into slang. It means simply to live, as the other\nidiom means to repent.] So the Metaphor, “This is my body,” has been\nforced to teach false doctrine by being translated literally.\nNo perversion of language has been fraught with greater calamity\nto the human race. Tens of thousands have suffered martyrdom at the\nhands of Rome rather than believe the “blasphemous fable” forced\ninto these words. The exquisite tortures of the Inquisition were\ninvented to coerce the consciences of men and compel them to\naccept this lie!\n\nLuther himself was misled, through his ignorance of this simple law\nof figurative language. In his controversy with Zwingle, he obstinately\npersisted in maintaining the literal sense of the figure, and thus forced\nit to have a meaning which it never has. He thus led the whole of\nGermany into his error! For, while his common sense rejected the\nerror of “Transubstantiation,” he fell into another, and invented the\nfigment of “Consubstantiation,” and fastened it upon the Lutheran\nChurch to this day.\n\nWhat a solemn and instructive lesson as to the importance of a\ntrue understanding of the figures of language!\nThe whole figure, in a metaphor, lies, as we have said, in the verb\nsubstantive “IS”; and not in either of the two nouns; and # is a\nremarkable fact that, when a pronoun is used instead of one of the\nnouns (as it is here), and the two nouns are of different genders, the\npronoun is always made to agree in gender with that noun to which\nthe meaning is carried across, and not with the noun from which it is\ncarried, and to which it properly belongs. This at once shows us that a\nfigure is being employed; when a pronoun, which ought, according to\nthe laws of language, to agree in gender with its own noun, is\nchanged, and made to agree with the noun which, by Metaphor,\nrepresents it.\n\nHere, for example, the pronoun, “this” (τοῦτό, touto), is neuter, and\nis thus made to agree with “body” (σῶμά, séma), which is neuter, and\nnot with bread (ἄρτος, artos), which is masculine.* [Note: In violation\nof this law, a recent revision of the Marathi Prayer Book has\ndeliberately changed the gender of the pronoun and made it to agree\nwith the word for “bread”!]\n\nThis is always the case in Metaphors, and a few examples may be\ncited here, instead of in their natural order and place.\n\nIn Zec. 5:8, “This is wickedness.” Here, “this” (fem.) does not\nagree with “ephah” (to which it refers), which is neuter (LXX. [Note:\nSeptuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ), but with “wickedness,” which is\nfeminine.\n\nIn Zec. 5:3, “This is the curse.” “This” (fem.) agrees with “curse,”\nwhich is feminine, and not with “flying roll,” which is neuter, (to which it\nrefers), (Spétravov, drepanon, LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).]).\n\nIn Mat. 13:38, “The good seed are the children of the kingdom.”\nHere, “these” (masc.) (οὗτοι, houtoi),t [Note: This pronoun is omitted\nin the English of the A.V. and Π.Ν] agrees with “children of the\nkingdom” (masc.), and not with seed (σπέρµα, sperma), which is\nneuter.\n\nLuk. 8:14, “These are they which having heard,” etc. Here, “these”\n(masc.) (οὗτοι, houtoi) agrees with the participle (οἱ ἀκούσαντες, hoi\nakousantes), “they which having heard,” which is masculine, and not\nwith the seed, (to which it refers), which is neuter.\n\nAll this establishes our statement that, in a Metaphor, the two\nnouns (or pronoun and noun) are always literal, and that the figure lies\nonly in the verb. Another remarkable fact is that in the vast number of\ncases where the language is literal, and there is no metaphor at all,\nthe verb is omitted altogether.* [Note: This rule does not apply to the\nHebrew, of course, as we have said above: because it has no verb “to\nbe.”] Even when a Metaphor has been used, and the language\npasses suddenly from figurative to literal, the verb is at once dropped,\nby Ellipsis, as not being necessary for the literal sense, as it was for\nthe previous figurative expression: e.g., in 1Co. 12:27, “Ye ARE the\nbody of Christ.” Here is a metaphor, and consequently the verb is\nused. But in verse 29, which is literal, the Change is at once made,\nand the fact is marked by the omission of the verb,” [Are] all apostles?\n[are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?”\nNext compare other examples of Metaphors which are naturally\n\nused in the explanations of Parables. Note the Parables of the Sower,\nand of the Tares (Mat. 13:19-23; Mat. 13:37-43).\n\n“He that soweth the good seed is (i.e., represents) the Son of\n\nman.”\n\n“The field is (i.e., signifies) the world.”\n\n“The good seed are the children of the kingdom.”\n\n“But the tares are the children of the wicked one.”\n\n“The enemy that sowed them is the devil.”\n“The harvest is the end of the age.”\n“And the reapers are the angels.”\nIn all these (as in every other Metaphor) the verb means, and\nmight have been rendered, “represents,” or “signifies.”\nThe Apocalypse is full of metaphors, e.g.:\n“The seven stars are ({6., represent) the angels of the seven\nchurches.”\n“And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven\nchurches” (1:20).\nThe odours “are the prayers of the saints” (5:8).\n“They are the spirits of demons” (16:14).\n“The seven heads are (i.e., represent) seven mountains (17:9):\netc., etc.\nSo in the very words that follow “this is (i.e., represents or\nsignifies) my body,” we have an undoubted Metaphor. “He took the\ncup ... saying ... this is my blood.” Here, thus, we have a pair of\nmetaphors. In the former one, “this” refers to “bread,” and it is claimed\nthat “is” means changed into the “body” of Christ. In the latter, “this”\nrefers to “the cup,” but it is not claimed that the cup is changed into\n“blood.” At least, we have never heard that such a claim has been put\nforward. The difference of treatment which the same figure meets with\nin these two verses is the proof that the former is wrong.\n\nIn 1Co. 11:25 we read “this cup is the new covenant.” Will\nRomanists, in and out of the Church of England, tell us how this “cup”\nbecomes transubstantiated into a “covenant”?\n\nIs it not clear that the figure in the words, “This is my body,” is\nforced into a literal statement with the set purpose and design of\nmaking it teach and support erroneous doctrine?\n\nOther examples of Metaphor in this immediate connection are:\n1Co. 10:16.-“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not ({6., does it\nnot represent) the communion of the blood of Christ.” through which\nall blessing comes to us?\n\n“The bread which we break, is it not (i.e., does it not represent) the\ncommunion of the body of Christ?” ie., does it not signify the\nfellowship of all the members of Christ\'s mystical body, who, being\nmany, are one body (1Co. 12:12)? “For we being many are one bread,\nand one body,” as 1Co. 10:17 declares.\n\nIt is because those who eat of that bread do not “discern” or\ndiscriminate that “one body” ({6., Christ mystical) that they are said to\neat to their own condemnation; for they witness to the fact of that\n“great Mystery” and yet are ignorant of its truth! And hence they\ncondemn themselves.\n\nFurther, the verb, εἰμι (eimi), Г am, or the infinitive of it, to be,\nmeans to be in the sense of signifying, amounting to. And that this is\none of its primary senses may be seen from the following passages,\nwhere it is actually translated “to mean,” and not merely to be:-“\n\n“But go ye and learn what that is” (i.e., meaneth, as in A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] ), Mat. 9:13.\n\n“But if ye had known what that is” (A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\nmeaneth), Mat. 12:7.\n\n“He asked what these things were” (A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n16141, meant), Luk. 15:26.\n“What is this?” (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] , “What meaneth this?”)\nAct. 2:12.\n\n“Now, while Peter doubted in himself what this vision was which\nhe had seen” (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of\nour English Bible, 1611.] , “What this vision should mean”), Act. 10:17,\netc., etc., etc.\n\nOn the other hand, if an actua/ change is meant, then there must\nbe a verb which shall plainly and actually say so: for the verb “to be”\nnever has or conveys any idea of such change.\nThe usual verb to express such a change is γίνομαι (ginomai),\nwhich means {ο be or become. Mar. 4:39, “There was (i.e., there\nbecame) a great calm,” and the storm was changed (or turned into)\ninto calm.\n\nLuk. 4:3, “Command this stone that it be made (i.e., changed into)\nbread.”\n\nJoh. 2:9, “When the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was\nmade (i.e., changed into) wine.”\n\nJoh. 16:20, “Your sorrow shall be turned into joy.” This was a real\ntransubstantiation.\n\nAct. 26:28, Agrippa said, “Almost thou persuadest me fo be (i.e., to\nbecome) a Christian.”\n\nRev. 8:8, “The third part of the sea became blood,” and in verse\n11, “Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.”\n\nIn all these cases (but the last) the verb is γίνομαι (ginomai), to\nbecome: and, if the Lord had meant that the bread became His body,\nthat is the verb He would have necessarily used. The fact that He did\nnot use it, but used the simple verb, εἶμι (eimi), instead, {6., “is,”\nproves conclusively that no change was meant, and that only\nrepresentation was intended.\n\nJust as when we are looking over a map and say, “This is\nEngland,” “This is America,” “This is Palestine,” etc., we do not mean\nthat that piece of paper is England, but we mean that those marks\nupon it represent those respective countries.\n\nFrom all this it is philologically, philosophically, and scientifically\nclear that the words, “This is my body,” mean “This [bread] represents\nmy body.” And as Professor Macbeth has put it, “We trample on the\nlaws of nature, and we trample on the laws of language when we force\nthe verb ‘is’ to mean what it never does mean.”\n\nAnd, besides all this, to pass from the use made of this perversion,\nsuppose for a moment that we grant the claim, and the words mean\nthat the Lord Jesus then and there did transmute the bread into His\nown body (if we can imagine such an impossibility!), what then?\nWhere is there a breath about His giving that power to any one else?\nWhere is there one word about such gifts being conferred? And, if it\nbe claimed, as it is by some traitors in the Church of England, that the\nwords, “Do this,” convey that power and authority, it could have been\nconveyed only to the eleven that were present. Where is there a\nbreath about not only giving them power, but delegating it to them to\ngive to others, and these to others again indefinitely? There is not one\nsingle word expressed or implied that conveys the idea that one iota of\nsuch power was conferred or delegated. So that the whole fabric of\ntransubstantiation rests on absolutely no foundation whatsoever!\nThere is a “missing link” which is fatal to the whole position.\n\nAnd this, on the assumption which we have only for the moment\ngranted. But, when it is seen that not only is there this link missing,\nwhich can never be supplied: but that there is also this claim which\ncan never be substantiated; we have an explanation of the Metaphor\nwhich sweeps the dogma out of the Scriptures, and proves it to be a\nfiction which is the outcome of ignorance, and this by arguments that\ncannot be overthrown, and facts that cannot be denied.\n\nJoh. 6:35. “I am the bread of life: {6., what bread does in supporting\nnatural life is a representation of what Christ does in supporting and\nnourishing the new, Divine, spiritual life.\n\nJoh. 8:12.-“l am the light of the world.”\n\nJoh. 10:9.-“I ат the door”: i.e., | ат what a door is. | am the entrance\nto the sheepfold, and to the Father. Yes, a door, and not a flight of\nsteps. A door, through which we pass in one movement from one side\nto the other.\n\nJoh. 15:5.-“I am the true vine.”\nHere the word ἀληθινός (aleethinos) helps the figure, for it means\ntrue as regards the reality in relation to shadows or representations.\nNot “true” as opposed to what is false, but the “very” vine: the vine all\nearthly vines represent, and to which they point in such Scriptures as\nIsa. 5:1-30 and Psa. 80:1-19* [Note: See an Article, by the same\nauthor, in Things to Come for July, 1899.]\n\nGal. 4:24.-“Which things are an allegory: for these are the two\ncovenants,” etc.',''),(134,134,'hypocatastasis','Its beauty and force will be at once seen, if we compare one or two\npassages.\n\nWhen, in Jer. 49:19, we read of the king of Babylon coming up\nagainst Edom, it says: “Behold, he shall come up like a lion ... against\nthe habitation of the strong”: etc. Here, we have a Simile, and the\nfeelings are unmoved, as it is only against Edom that the assault is\nmade.\n\nBut it is a very different case in Jer. 4:7, where the same king of\nBabylon is spoken of as coming up against Zion. In the heat of excited\nfeeling he is not named, but only implied.\n\n“The lion is come up from his thicket.”\n\nSo, in all the other cases, it will be well to contrast every example\nof Hypocatastasis with both Simile and Metaphor, in order to gather\nthe full force of its meaning and the reason for its use instead of either\nof the other two.\nPsa. 22:16 (17).-“Оод5 have compassed me about.”\n\nHere He does not say that his enemies were like dogs, or that\nthey were dogs; no: the word “enemies” is not mentioned. It is implied:\nand by a kind of Prosopopoeia, they are spoken of as “dogs.” It means\nof course, “mine enemies have compassed me about” as the next.\nsentence goes on to explain. See also under Paronomasia.\nMat. 15:13.-“Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted,\nshall be rooted up.” This is Hypocatastasis, bordering on Allegory.\nPersons are implied, though only plants are named. The solemn\nlesson of this implication is, that unless the work in the heart be that of\nGod Himself, all is vain. It is useless therefore to attempt to effect\nconversion or to impart a new nature by personal appeals,\npersuasions, or excitement. This is only to make the flesh religious,\nand “that which is born of the flesh is flesh.”\n\nMat. 16:6.-“Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the\nSadducees.” There the word “doctrine” is implied. Had the Lord said,\n“the doctrine of the Pharisees is like leaven,” that would have been\nSimile, and a cold, bare statement of fact; but He did not say so. Had\nHe said “the doctrine of the Pharisees is leaven,” that would have\nbeen Metaphor, much bolder, much more forcible, but not so true to\nfact though much truer to truth. But He did not say so. He took the\nword “doctrine” and put it down underneath, and did not mention it at\nall. He only implied it: and this was Hypocatastasis.\n\nNo wonder then that the attention of the disciples was excited and\nattracted. No wonder their interest was aroused: for this was the\nLord’s object.\n\n“They reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have\ntaken no bread. Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O\nye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have\nbrought no bread? Do ye not yet understand?... How is it that ye do\nnot understand that | spake not to you concerning bread, that ye\nshould beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Saducees?\nThen understood they how that he bade them not beware of the\nleaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the\nSadducees” (verses 6-12). This example is remarkable when we\ncompare it with another, in the previous chapter, which we give next;\nand out of its textual order for the purpose of contrast.\n\nMat. 15:26.-“It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to\ndogs.” Here, the Lord Jesus, did not say to the woman of Canaan,\nThou art a dog of the Gentiles (which would have been Metaphor), but\nHe left out all reference to her, and only referred to her by implication,\nsubstituting a “dog” for herself. The woman, unlike the disciples (in\nchap. 16), at once saw and understood what the Lord implied, viz.,\nthat it was not meet to take that which belonged to Israel and give it to\na Gentile (or a dog of a Gentile as they were called by the Jews), “And\nshe said, Truth, Lord.” What she felt is clear: “It is quite true; Thou art\nperfectly right; | called Thee ‘the Son of David,’ and deserved no\nanswer; | pleaded for ‘help’ and said: ‘Lord, help me’; but | made no\nconfession as to who the ‘me’ was: no acknowledgment of my\nunworthiness and unmeetness as ‘a dog of the Gentiles.’ ” “Truth,\nLord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master’s\ntable. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy\nfaith.”\n\nSo, it is “great faith” to understand what the Lord implied by the\nuse of this beautiful figure, and it is “little faith” not to understand it!\neven though the former was spoken of a Gentile woman, and the latter\nof the apostles of the Lord. See also under Synecdoche and Meiosis.\nJoh. 2:19.-“Destroy this temple, and in three days | will raise it up.”\nThe Lord Jesus did not say that His body was like the temple (that\nwould have been Simile), or that it was His body (that would have\nbeen Metaphor). He merely implied the word body, as ver. 21 plainly\ndeclares: “He spake of the temple of his body.”\n\nHere was neither “great faith” nor ‘little faith,” but wilful unbelief of\nHis words. His disciples remembered them after He was raised from\nthe dead, and believed. His enemies remembered them before and\nperverted them: “This fellow said, | am able to destroy the temple of\nGod, and to build it in three days” (Mat. 26:61). He said no such thing.\nWhat He foretold was that they would destroy “this temple” of His\nbody, and that He should raise it again from the dead in three days,\nand build it again. See also under Heterosis.\n\nOther examples are:-\n\nMat. 3:10.-“Where, by the axe being laid to the root of the trees, etc.,\nis implied the result of the ministry of John the Baptist.\n\nThe same is the case with ver. 12.\n\nMat. 5:29-30.-“May also be explained by this figure better than by\nHyperbole (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). The right eye, etc., is compared\nby implication to the most highly prized possession.\nMat. 7:3-5.-“The mote and beam refer by implication to anything that\nperverts the vision.\n\nMat. 7:6.-“Here “dogs” and “swine” are compared by implication to\npersons.\n\nMar. 1:17.-“I will make you to become fishers of men.” The Lord does\nnot say like fishers, nor does He use direct metaphor. The\nresemblance is only by implication.\n\nAct. 20:29.-“I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves\nenter in among you, not sparing the flock.”\n\nThus does the Holy Spirit inform us, by Implication, as to the true\ncharacter of “apostolic succession,” in order to impress the solemn\nfact on our minds.',''),(135,135,'allegory','Isa. 5:1-6.-“This is an Allegory which combines both forms. “Judah\nand Jerusalem” (concerning whom Isaiah prophecies 1:1) are again\nrepresented as a vine, and the Allegory commences by implying them,\nand afterwards proceeds to substitute them (vers. 3-7).\n\nAllegory thus differs from Parable, for a parable is a continued\nSimile. № never departs from the simple statement that one thing\nresembles another. While the allegory represents, or implies, that the\none thing is the other. As in the allegory of the Pilgrim’s Progress:\nWhat is spoken of one person refers to another person in similar\ncircumstances and experiences. In Psa. 80:1-19 and Isa. 5:1-30, what\nis spoken of a Vine refers to Israel: but, in Genesis, what is stated of\nIsrael and Ishmael, Sarah and Hagar is all true history, yet in Gal.\n4:1-31 it is made to speak of and set forth other truths, and hence\nthere it is, and is called an “Allegory” (Gal. 4:24).\nNo figure requires more careful discrimination than Allegory. And it\nwould be safer to say that there are no allegories in Scripture than to\nfollow one’s own judgment as to what is allegory, and what is not.\n\nAt any rate, we have only one which is distinctly declared to be\nsuch; and that is Gal. 4:22; Gal. 4:24. “It is written, that Abraham had\ntwo sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free woman. But he\nwho was of the bond-woman was born after the flesh; but he of the\nfree-woman was by promise. Which things are an Allegory”: or, which\nthings teach or tell us something beyond what is said.\n\nThe modern and common usage of the word allegoria is thus quite\ndifferent from this Scriptural definition. According to the modern sense\nit is taken to mean a fictitious narrative which has another and deeper\nmeaning than that which is expressed.\n\nAn allegory may sometimes be fictitious, but Gal. 4:1-31 shows us\nthat a true history may be allegorized (i.e., be shown to have further\nteaching in that which actually took place) without detracting from the\ntruth of the history. Here note this important fact: that, in either case,\nAllegory is always stated in the past tense, and never in the future.\nAllegory is thus distinguished from Prophecy. The Allegory brings\nother teaching out of past events, while the prophecy tells us events\nthat are yet to come, and means exactly what is said.\nGen. 49:1-33.-“The prophetical blessing of Jacob is mixed. Part of it is\nSimile (verse 4). Some is Metaphor (verse 9). In some parts the\nMetaphors are repeated, in which case we have Allegory.\nJdg. 9:7-15.-“This is not a parable, as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] chapter-heading\ncalls it; because there is no similitude, by which one thing is likened to\nanother. It is a continued Hypocatastasis, only one of the two things\nbeing plainly mentioned. Were it not for the interpretation given, in\nverses 16-20, there would be nothing beyond what is implied.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the four trees referred to-“the Fig-tree,\nthe Olive, the vine, and the Bramble-“are the four which are used to\ncombine the whole of Israel’s history.\nThe fig-tree represents the National position of Israel, from which\nwe learn (in the Synoptic Gospels) that it withered away and has been\ncut down.\n\nThe olive tree represents the Covenant privileges of Israel (Rom.\n14:1-96): which are now in abeyance.\n\nThe vine represents Israel’s Spiritual blessings, which henceforth\nare to be found only in Christ, the True Vine (Joh. 15:1-27).\n\nThe bramble represents the Antichrist, in whose shadow they will\nyet trust, but who will be to Israel a consuming fire in the day of\n“Jacob’s trouble’-“the great Tribulation.”* [Note: See Things to Come\nfor July, 1899. A. Holness, 14 Paternoster Row.]\n\nIsa. 28:20 is Allegory: i.e., repeated Hypocatastasis, only one part of\nthe figure being mentioned: viz., the bed and its covering, and not the\npeople to whom it refers. The prophet is speaking of the great fear\nwhich ought to agitate the people of Judea at the speedy coming of\nSennacherib; but they preferred to be left in their false security. By this\nbeautiful allegorical illustration they are informed that their rest should\nbe restless, and their sleep should be soon disturbed.\n\nMat. 3:10; Mat. 3:12 is repeated Hypocatastasis, and therefore\nAllegory.\nMat. 5:13 is the same, following on “Ye are the salt of the earth,”\nwhich is Metaphor.\nMat. 7:3-5 is the same; only one thing, the mote and the beam, being\nnamed. What they mean is only implied.\nMat. 9:15 is the same, the meaning being implied.\nMat. 9:16-17.-“The “old piece” on the new implies the solemn lesson\nas to the impossibility of reforming the Old nature.\nMat. 12:43-45.-“When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man,” etc.\nThis is an Allegory. It is to be interpreted of the Jewish nation, as\nverse 45 declares. By application also it teaches the unclean spirit’s\ngoing out of his own accord, and not being “cast out” (verse 28, 29).\nWhen he is “cast out,” he never returns; but when he “goes out,” he\ncomes back; and finds only a “reformed character,” instead of the Holy\nSpirit indwelling in the one who is born again.\nLuk. 9:62.-“No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking\nback, is fit for the kingdom of God.” This is a brief allegory.\n\nFor other examples, see Joh. 4:35. Rom. 11:16-18, etc.; 13:11, 12.\n10ο. 3:6-8; 1Co. 3:12-15; 1Со. 5:7-8. 2Co. 3:2-3; 2Co. 5:1, etc.;\n10:3-5; 11:2. Gal. 6:8. Eph. 6:11, etc.',''),(136,136,'parabola','1Sa. 10:12 : We read of “the proverb,” “Is Saul also among the\nprophets?” So 1Sa. 24:14 (13): Of “the proverb of the ancients,”\n“Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked.” Compare Eze. 12:22; Eze.\n16:44; Eze. 18:2. Deu. 28:37. 2Ch. 7:20. Psa. 44:14 (15). Jer. 24:9.\nBut see below under Parcemia.\n\nGrowing out of this came a later meaning of 22? (mahshal) as\nused of any saying which required an explanation. We see this as\nearly as in Eze. 20:47-49.\nIn the New Testament instances of the word, it is used of a story\nwith a hidden meaning, without pressing, in every detail, the idea of a\ncomparison.\n\nAs the name of a Figure of Speech, it is limited to what we may\ndescribe as repeated or continued Simile-an illustration by which one\nset of circumstances is likened to another. It consists in likeness, not\nin representation, and therefore is not a continued Metaphor, as some\nhave said; but a repeated Simile.\n\nThis likeness is generally only in some special point. One person\nmay be like another in appearance, but not in character, and vice\nversa; so that when resemblance or likeness is affirmed it is not to be\nconcluded that the likeness may be pressed in all points, or extended\nto all particulars.\n\nFor example, a lion is used as a resemblance of Christ, on account\nof his strength and prowess. The Devil is likened to “a lion” because of\nhis violence and cruelty. Christ is compared to a thief, on account of\nhis coming, being unexpected; not on account of dishonesty.\n\nThe resemblance is to be sought for in the scope of the context,\nand in the one great truth which is presented, and the one important\nlesson which is taught: and not in all the minute details with which\nthese happen to be associated.\n\nThe interpretation of the parable must be further distinguished\nfrom any application which may be made of it. For example: in the\nParable of the “Ten Virgins” (Mat. 25:1-12), the interpretation belongs\nto some special point of time immediately preceding the return of the\nLord to the earth. This is indicated by the word “Then,” with which it\ncommences, and by its place in relation to the context. Any lesson for\nourselves, as to watchfulness on our part, must come as an\napplication of it to present circumstances.\n\nSo with the parable of the Great Supper (Luk. 14:16-24). The\napplication to the present time must not blot out the interpretation of it,\nwhich refers to the successive ministries Connected with the\ninvitations to “the great supper.”\n\n(1) “A certain man” sends “his servant” to those who had been\npreviously “bidden.” This was Peter’s first ministry (Act. 2:1-47 -vii.).\nAll excuse themselves.\n\n(2) The “master of the house” sends him again to “the streets and\nlanes of the city.” This is Peter’s second ministry (Act. 10:1-48 -xii.).\n\n(3) Then “the lord” sends out another servant to “the highways and\nhedges.” This is Paul’s ministry to the great Gentile world (Act.\n-xxviii.)\n\nParables are used from the resemblance of one thing to another.\nThe thing, or history, or story may be true or imaginary; but the events\nmust be possible, or likely to have happened; at any rate those who\nhear must believe that they are possible events, though it is not\nnecessary that the speaker should believe them.\n\nWhere they are impossible, such as trees or animals speaking and\nreasoning, we have Fable; and if the Fable is explained, then we have\nAllegory (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). See Jdg. 9:8-15, where we should\nhave Fable, but for the application of it, which we have in verse 16,\nwhich renders it Allegory.\n\nWe do not propose to give even a list of the parables of Scripture,\nas they can be so easily and readily found by the reader.\nOne word of caution, however, we must give: and that is\nconcerning the object of parables. The common idea is that they are\nintended to make things clear and plain. Hence every young minister\nand Sunday-school teacher turns to the parables as though they were\nthe simplest things in the world. Whereas they were spoken that the\ntruth might be veiled from those who “seeing, see not: and hearing,\nhear not.” See Mat. 13:10-17. Hence they are among the most difficult\nportions of God’s Word.\n\nWithout wearying the student with all the varying definitions and\nexplanations which Rhetoricians and Divines have given, we add what\nis perhaps the best classification of Similitudes, viz.: that by P. Rutilius\nLupus.\n\n|. Paradeigma.\n1. Persons without words.\n2. Words without persons.\n3. Both persons and words.\nIl. Parabola or Parable.\n1. Icon. Simile forming a complete image.\n2. Homeeon.

The letter (2) ought, therefore, to be\ncancelled. In this case 22 (ish), man, is put for 22? (ish), men, and\n22222 (vannashsheem), we have laid them waste, would then be\nthe plural of 22?

There is\nall the difference in the world between a dirty sheep and a washed\nsow!

Parcemice which, though not quoted as such, were very\nprobably already in use as proverbial expressions\n“Like to a grain of mustard seed” (Mat. 13:31-32; Mat. 17:20. Luk.\n17:6).

Berachoth.\nfol. 55, 2.] where, concerning dreams, it says “They do not show a\nman а palm-tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a\nneedle.” The gloss is, “A thing which he was not wont to see, nor\nconcerning which he had ever thought.” Another example is\ngiven,t [Note: Baba Mezia, fol. 38, 2.] where Rabbi Sheshith\nanswered R. Areram, disputing with him, and asserting something that\nwas incongruous of him, and said, “Perhaps thou art one of these\nPombeditha, who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a\nneedle”: i.e., as the Aruch interprets it, “Who speak things that are\nimpossible.”\n\n“That strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel” (Mat. 23:24). Not\n“straining at a gnat.” See Buxtorf in Lex. Talmud, under 222.\n\n“With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again”\n(Mat. 7:2).

The common experience of\nthis fact has made this a common proverb; but they are blessed\nindeed who learn and know from a happy experience that when Christ\nbecame Surety for His People, who were “strangers,” He smarted for\nit, and was “sore broken” that they might be for ever blessed.\nPro. 22:6.-“Train up a child in the way he should go.”\n\nFew proverbs have passed more into common use than this.

But to-day the saying has passed into general use, and is\nspoken (not so correctly) of every one.\n\nMat. 9:12.-“They that be whole need not a physician.”\n\nMat. 10:10.-“The workman is worthy of his meat.” So Luk. 10:7. 1Co.\n9:7, etc.\n\nVerse 22: “He that endureth to the end shall be saved.” This\nParoemia is further used Dan. 12:12. Mat. 24:13. Mar. 13:13, etc. and\nrefers to the faithful remnant of Jews enduring to the end of the\ncoming “great tribulation.” The τέλος (telos), end, should be\ndistinguished from the συντέλεια (sunteleia), which is also translated\nend.\nThe latter word is used of the time of the end, while the former\n(telos) is used of the end or crisis of the sunteleia. The sunteleia refers\nto the consummation of all the ages and dispensations; a joining\ntogether of the ages, or ends, as it were, and is used of the whole time\nof the “great tribulation”; while the {είος is the point of time at the end\nof it. It is of this point that this saying is used: “He that endureth to the\nend (fe/os) shall be saved (or delivered).”\n\nThe word συντέλεια (sunteleia) occurs only in Mat. 13:39-40; Mat.\n13:49; Mat. 24:3; Mat. 28:20, and Heb. 9:26. It will be easy, therefore,\nfor the student to distinguish it from τέλος (telos), which is used in the\nother passages.\n\nMat. 12:34.-“For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth\nspeaketh.”\n\nMat. 13:57.-“A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country\nand in his own house.”\n\nMat. 15:14.-“If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”\nMat. 24:28.-“For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be\ngathered together.” The word “for” introduces the Paroemia, which is\nfrom Job. 39:30. “Her young ones suck up blood: and where the slain\nare, there is she.” Had this Parcemia been understood, and the title\n“Son of Man” noticed as referring to Christ’s title as exercising\ndominion in the Earth,* [Note: See The Divine Names and Titles, by\nthe same author and publisher. One shilling.] these words would\nnever have been interpreted of the church as the “Body” of Christ.\nLuk. 17:37 clearly shows that it is a time of judgment (see verses\n24-37); and that the taking and the /eaving refer to judgment, and not\nto the Rapture of 1Th. 4:17; which was a subsequent revelation, and\nought not to be read into the Gospels, which are perfectly clear\nwithout it.\n\nMar. 9:50.-See Mat. 5:13.\n\nLuk. 17:37.-See Mat. 24:28 above.\n\nAct. 9:5.-“It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks”: i.e., the goads.\nAct. 20:35.-“It is more blessed to give than to receive.” This is one of\nthe un-recorded Paroemice or Logia of Christ. But it does not follow\nthat a papyrus which professes, some centuries later, to give other\nParcemice is genuine and authentic.\n\n1Co. 5:6.-“А little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.” Leaven is always\nused in a bad sense. Even in the case of one of the two wave-loaves,\nleaven was to be used because that loaf represented human nature;\nwhile the other loaf which represented Christ\'s perfect nature had no\nleaven.\nSee other examples of such Proverbs in Pro. 11:27; Pro. 12:11;\nPro. 12:15; Pro. 15:2; Pro. 15:33; Pro. 17:1; Pro. 17:10; Pro. 17:19;\nPro. 17:28; Pro. 19:2; Pro. 19:24; Pro. 20:4; Pro. 20:11; Pro. 20:14;\nPro. 20:21; Pro. 20:25; Pro. 22:13; Pro. 25:11; Pro. 25:16; Pro. 25:27;\nPro. 26:4-5 (see under Ellipsis), 14; 27:8, 10, 22; 30:15, etc., etc. Ecc.\n4:5; Ecc. 4:12; Ecc. 5:2; Ecc. 5:6; Ecc. 5:8-10; Ecc. 6:9; Ecc. 9:18;\nEcc. 10:2; Ecc. 10:8-9; Ecc. 10:15; Ecc. 10:19-20; Ecc. 11:3-4; Ecc.\n11:7; Ecc. 12:12.

Tit. 1:15\n\nNon-Canonical, or, Supposed Scripture, Proverbs\nThere are many common sayings which are supposed to be in\nScripture, even by those who should know better; and pass current\namong those who are ill-informed. For example-\n\n“God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.”\nThis is not in the Bible; but is taken from Laurence-Sterne’s\nSentimental Journey. And he took it probably from the French of Henri\nEtienne, Dieu mesure le froid x la brebis tondue. And both may have\nbeen acquainted with Isa. 27:8 : “He stayeth his rough wind in the day\nof his east wind.”\n\n“Spare the rod and spoil the child.”\n\nMany use this, thinking it is Scripture. Even Butler, in his Hudibras,\nsays: “That may be heard ten times to one quotation of Solomon.” And\nyet Solomon said: “He that spareth the rod hateth his son” (Pro.\n13:24).\n\n“A word to the wise is sufficient.” (Sometimes “for them” is added,\nwhereas it is singular, not plural).\n\nThis has been quoted as Scripture. But it is from the Latin of\nTerence* [Note: Phormio, Act. 3:1-26 sc. 3. 5:8. In Parry\'s edition of\nTerence, he says in a note that the Proverb is found in Plautus Persa\n4:7. 18.] ; who himself is misquoted; for he said: “Dictum sapienti sat\nest,” not Verbum sat sapienti.\n\nIt is said that the celebrated Robert Hall once planned a sermon\non the words\n“In the midst of life we are in death,”\n\nBut he abandoned it, we are told, when he found that it was not to\nbe found in the Bible; but only in the Prayer-book.\n\nIt appears to have come from a monk of St. Gall, named Notker, in\nthe tenth century, whose Latin hymn contained the line: “Media vita in\nmorte sumus.”\n\nMisquoted Proverbial Sayings\nEven in quoting common sayings from Scripture and the Prayer Book,\nwhich have passed into Proverbs, there is an habitual misquotation\nwhich has become practically universal. It may not be out of place to\ngive one or two examples by way of warning.\n\n“Man is prone to sin as the sparks fly upward.” But Job. 5:7 says:\n“Man is born unto trouble,” etc.\n\n“A still small voice” is generally quoted as “the still small voice”\n(Ki. 19:12)\n\n“A merciful man is merciful to his beast.” But Pro. 12:10 has it: “A\nrighteous man regardeth the life of his beast.”\n“The truth as it is in Jesus” is almost invariably thus quoted. The\nScripture says (Eph. 4:21): “As the truth is in Jesus,” which is a very\ndifferent thing. The former implies that there is truth apart from Him.\nBut the latter implies that the truth is in Jesus, and nowhere else.\n\n“A nation shall be born in a day.” No concordance will give this\npassage. Isa. 66:8 asks: “Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one\nday? or shall a nation be born at once?”\n\n“So plain that he who runs may read.” On the contrary. So plain\nwas to be the written vision that he who reads it may run, and flee\nfrom the coming judgments (Hab. 2:2).\n\n“My time is in thy hand.” Thank God, He said “times” (Psa. 31:15\n(16)). Yes, “My times are always in thy hand.” All my times: my times\nof sorrow and of joy; of trouble and of danger. All are in the hand of my\nGod.* [Note: Shakespeare is misquoted in the other direction. He said:\n“The time is out of joint,” not the times are out of joint. The next line\nwould set people right, for he says:-\n\n“The time is out of joint;-O cursed spite!\n\nThat | was born to set it right.”\n(Hamlet, Acti. sc. 4, at the close).\n\nSo Cowper: “The cups that cheer,” not cup. (See his Task, 4:39,\n40).]\n\n“Let him cast the first stone.” But Joh. 8:7 says: “He that is without\nsin among you, let him first cast a stone.”\n\n“How great a fire a little matter kindleth.” But in Jam. 3:5 it is\nwritten: “Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth.”\nThe Apostolic benediction (2Co. 13:14) suffers from various\nchanges: fellowship, instead of communion; or, in addition to it, as\nthough they were two different things: rest upon and abide; be and\nabide: for ever; now, henceforth, and for ever; now and for ever. And\nthese are supposed to improve the words of the Holy Spirit! That such\nattempted improvement of Scripture meets with no check is a sad sign\nof the low regard in which its accuracy is held.\n',''),(139,139,'type','In the New Testament the word occurs in several of these senses.\n\nIt is rendered:-\n1. Α print or mark (Joh. 20:25).* [Note: The second occurrence\nin this verse is read OU, the place, by Lachmann, Tischendorf,\nTregelles (margin).]\n\n2. Figure (Act. 7:43. Rom. 5:14).\n\n3. Form (Rom. 6:17).\n\n4. Fashion (Act. 7:44).\n\n5. Manner (Act. 23:25).\n\n6. Pattern (Tit. 2:7. Heb. 8:5).\n\n7. Ensample (10ο. 10:11. Php. 3:17. 1Th. 1:7).¢ [Note:\nAccording to the best texts, this is singular, as in R.V., not\nplural.] 2Th. 3:9. 1Pe. 5:3\n\n8. Example (1Co. 10:6. 1Ti. 4:12).\n\nThe Greeks used it of the symptoms of a disease. Galen wrote a\nmedical work entitled περὶ τῶν τύπων, concerning symptoms. In a\nLegal sense it was used of what we technically cite as a “case.”\n\nIt will thus be seen that the special and technical sense which has\nbeen given to it by Theologians is not exactly equivalent to any of\nthese usages: the nearest being Rom. 5:14, where Adam is spoken of\nas a type of the Coming One.\n\nThe theological use of the word agrees more with what in the New\nTestament is called σκιά (skia), a shadow (Heb. 10:1-39 i. Col. 2:17).\n\nThere is, therefore, not much profit in following out what have been\ncalled types by men. Many are merely illustrations; and it would be\nbetter so to call them; inasmuch as they did not and do not of\nthemselves teach the truths, but only illustrate those truths which are\nelsewhere clearly revealed. We should never have called them types\nbut for such subsequent revelation; and therefore they are only\nillustrations so far as their teaching agrees with clear revelation\nafterward made.',''),(140,140,'symbol','Speaking of Isa. 7:14, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a\nson,” he says, “since this refers to the house of David, Isaiah has\nexplained how that which was spoken by God to David, ἐν μυστηρίῳ\n(en mysteerio), in a mystery, would actually come to pass. Perhaps,”\nhe adds, “you are not aware, my friends, of this-that there were many\nsayings written ἐπικεκαλυμμένως (epikekalummenés), obscurely; or,\nἐν. παραβολαῖς (en parabolais), in parables; or, µυστηρίοις\n(mysteeriois), in secret signs; or, ἐν συµβόλοις (en symbolois), in\nsymbols; which the prophets, who lived after the persons who said or\ndid them, expounded.”$ [Note: Trypho, ο. 68.]\n\nThus it will be seen that symbol is practically synonymous with the\nlatter use of mystery as meaning a secret sign. It is only two or three\ntimes so used in Scripture:-In Rev. 1:20, the stars which John saw\nwere a mystery: i.e., secret sign (or symbol); and in Rev. 17:5; Rev.\n17:7, Babylon is said to be а mysteerion (or symbol): /.е., a secret sign\nof something spiritual and moral which it represented.\n\nEph. 5:32 shows us that it was also synonymous with the Latin\nsacramentum, which is there used to represent the Greek mysteerion.\nSo that the sacramentum of the Latin Vulgate meant simply a symbol.\n\nSacramentum is said to have reference to a military oath, but it\nmust have been only because of some secret sign used in connection\nwith the administration of the oath. From this it is clear that “the\nsacrament’ so called is only a secret sign or symbol of spiritual truths\nand acts or events which it is used to commemorate.\n\nDoubtless there are many symbols in the Scriptures, but great\ncare and caution must be exercised in their interpretation. The\ndifferent interpretations which have been given to the same so-called\nsymbol, are sufficient to serve as a warning.\n\nAll Metonymies (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) are, in a certain sense,\nsymbols. When, for example, “cup” is used, by Metonymy, for blessing\n(Psa. 16:5; Psa. 116:13); or, “clay” for man (Isa. 64:8 (7)); or, “gate” for\nentrance, etc., the one is practically a symbol of the other: and when\nby repeated and constant use the one gets to be more and more\nclosely associated with the other, it is then used as a symbol of it and\nis substituted for it. The transition stage is Hypocatastasis (q.v. [Note:\nWhich зее.] ) or Implication.\n\nThe stages by which a symbol is reached, therefore, are: (1) either\nby Metonymy or Metaphor, one thing is used to represent another;\nthen (2) the one is used to imply the other; and finally (3) it becomes\npermanently substituted for it as a symbol of it.\n\nThus, with regard to “leaven,” we have first the thing itself causing\nfermentation, and therefore forbidden to be used in connection with\nany sacrifice or offering to the Lord. Then it is used by Metonymy for\nthat which is corrupt (1Co. 5:6-8). Then by /mplication for corrupt or\nevil doctrine (Mat. 16:6). And finally it is used as the permanent\nsymbol of it (Mat. 13:33). Indeed, “leaven” is always used in a bad\nsense, and of that which is corrupt. In the case of the two wave-\nloaves, where leaven was to be put into one and not into the other, the\nexception is significant, and proves the rule. For one represented\nChrist, and the other His People.\nIn the same way, “key” is used as a symbol of power and authority,\nand especially the power of opening and closing (Rev. 1:18; Rev. 3:7.\nIsa. 22:22). In Mat. 16:19, the power and authority of opening the\ndoors of the kingdom were committed to Peter, and he exercised that\ncommission in making the final offer of the Messiah to the nation of\nIsrael (Act. 2:1-47 -viii., and x.). Observe, that they were the keys of\nthe Kingdom, not of the church; and that he was altogether\nincompetent and unable to transfer that power and authority to others.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary for us to attempt to say more with regard\nto symbols. The subject would form a work by itself; and, indeed,\nmany works have been written upon it. We can only repeat our caution\nas to their use.',''),(141,141,'nigma','See Psa. 78:2 quoted in Mat. 13:35. The “dark saying” of the Old\nTestament is 2222 (cheedah); from 22? (chood), to tie in a knot, to\ntwist: a knotty or intricate saying.\n\nIt is rendered dark saying three times (Psa. 49:4 (5); 78:2. Pro.\n1:6); dark sentence, once (Dan. 8:23); dark speech, once (Num. 12:8);\nhard question, twice (1Ki. 10:1. 2Ch. 9:1); proverb, once (Hab. 2:6);\nriddle, nine times (Jdg. 14:12-19. Eze. 17:2).\n\nWhen the saying is very obscure indeed, it is called\n\nHYPNIGMA, i.e., the same word, with the preposition ὑπό (hypo)\nprefixed, meaning under, i.e., а saying deep as well as dark.\n\nAlso HYPNIXIS, from ὑπό (hypo), under, and αἰνισσομαι\n(ainissomai), to speak darkly. Hence, a speaking beneath: i.e., having\nanother meaning beneath what is actually said.\nWhen the Enigma is connected with the names of persons or\nplaces, it is known by the name Polyonymia. (See the next Figure).\nThere are sayings dark and deep in the Scriptures beside those\nthat are actually so designated.\nGen. 49:10 is in the form of Enigma. “The sceptre shall not depart\nfrom Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come;\nand unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” See under\nMetonymy.\nJdg. 14:14.-Samson’s Enigma is well known.\n“Out of the eater came forth meat,\nAnd out of the strong came forth sweetness.”\nThe answer is given in verse 18, in the form of another question\n(See Anteisagoge):\n“What is sweeter than honey?\nAnd what is stronger than a lion?”\nThis is a saying both “dark” and “deep”: for there is precious truth\nhidden in that darkness and those depths, which neither the Philistines\nnor the natural man can understand or receive.\n\nThe Living Word (Christ) is stronger than the strong man armed\n(Mat. 12:29. Mar. 3:27. Luk. 12:21-22). For the Lion means in Hebrew\nthe strong one.\n\nThe Written Word (the Scriptures of truth) are sweeter than honey\n(Psa. 119:103; Psa. 19:10 (11). Jer. 15:16).\n\nAll who know this blessed deliverance which the great Deliverer\nbrings, cry out in the words of Psa. 35:10, “Lord, who is like unto thee,\nwhich deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the\npoor and needy from him that spoileth him?” (See Erotesis and\nProsopopeosia).\n\nThe Law was a strong Lion (Gal. 3:10): but the honey is found in\nverse 13.\nSin is a strong Lion (Rom. 5:21): but the honey is found in Rom.\n6:6; Rom. 7:18-25. And 1Co. 15:56-57.\n\nThe World is a strong Lion (Luk. 8:14. Gal. 5:21): but the honey is\nfound in Joh. 16:33.\n\nAffliction is a strong Lion (Job. 5:6-7; Job. 14:1-2.

See under\nParonomasia.',''),(142,142,'polyonymia','In Mat. 15:39, for example, there is no Enigma, but merely a case\nof two names for the same place: “The coasts of Magdala.” In Mar.\n8:10, it is called “The parts of Dalmanutha,” Dalmanutha being the\nname of the region and Magdala of the city. The former was general,\nthe latter was special.\n\nIn Mat. 8:28, the people are called Gergesenes; and in Luk. 8:26,\nand Mar. 5:1, Gadarenes. Some suppose that these were either\ndifferent names of the same place, or two places forming one larger\nplace. It is a question also as to whether precisely the same event is\ndescribed in these places, or whether two similar events took place at\ntwo different times.\n\nSo with the names of Esau’s wives, which have formed a great\nsubject for the attention of infidels.\n\nIt is clear from a comparison of Gen. 26:34; Gen. 28:9, that Esau’s\nwives were three in number:\n\n1. “The daughter of Elon the Hittite”; called Adah (Gen. 36:2); but\nshe also had another name, Bashemath (Gen. 26:34).\n\n2. “The daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite”; called\nAholibamah (Gen. 36:2); but not the Aholibamah of verse 25, who was\nher aunt (compare verses 2 and 25). She was called also Judith, and\nin 26:34 this Judith is said to be the daughter of Beeri the Hittite. But\nthere is no contradiction in this, for Anah appears to have been called\nBeeri, or the Spring-man, because he discovered the “hot-springs”\n(see Gen. 36:24)* [Note: So the R.V., 2222 (Hay-ye-meem), from\n22? (Hoom), to put in commotion, agitate (Deu. 7:23. Mic. 2:12. Psa.\n55:3). The Syriac has “waters.” “Mules” are always 22222\n(Pharahdeem), (2Sa. 13:29; 2Sa. 18:9. 1Ki. 10:25. 2Ki. 5:17. Psa.\n32:9, etc.). The A.V. Translators followed an error of the Talmud.\nMoreover, 222 (matzah), to find, means to happen on, not to invent.]\n; not “mules,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.]\nIt is true that in Gen. 36:2, Anah, alias Beeri, is called “the Hivite,”\nwhile in Gen. 26:34, he is called “the Hittite.” The latter is history, and\nis therefore general; the former is genealogy, and is therefore more\nprecise. “Hittite” is the general term; “Hivite” is the special and more\nparticular term (compare Jos. 1:4. 1Ki. 10:29. 2Ki. 7:6; and Gen. 28:8,\nwhen Esau’s Hittite wives are spoken of as “daughters of Canaan’).\n\n3. The third wife was “the daughter of Ishmael,” and was called\nBashemath (Gen. 36:2), and Mahalath (Gen. 28:8).\n\nWhen three persons are so carefully and minutely described, it is\npreposterous for anyone to create a difficulty about the similar names,\nwhen down to our own day precisely the same phenomenon\nconstantly occurs.\n\nBut this feature of Polyonymia is not what we are describing and\ndiscussing here. There is no Enigma in these common aliases.\n\nIt is only when another name is given, because of some special\nmeaning, “dark” or “deep” in it, that it becomes a Figure, being used in\na figurative sense, having some important signification beyond what\nappears upon the surface.\n\nGen. 10:10; Gen. 11:2.-“The Land of Shinar” is another name for\nBabel or Babylon. Babylon must be intended by “the land of Shinar.” in\nthe prophecy of the “Ephah” (Zec. 5:11). Had the name Babylon been\nused here it might have been urged that it was put by Enigma for\nsome other place; but, when “the land of Shinar” is used for Babylon it\ncan hardly be that, after this, Babylon can be used for some other\nname by a double use of the figure.\n\nDeu. 1:2; Deu. 1:44; Deu. 2:8, etc.-Edom is called Seir, and this was\nafterwards known in the Jerusalem Targum as 2222, Gabla or\nGebal.\n\nWe have the name in Psa. 83:6 (7). “Gebal, and Ammon, and\nAmelek”: i.e., Edom, Ammon, and Amelek-three of Israel\'s greatest\nenemies at critical moments in the history of the Nation.\n2Ki. 23:13.-The Mount of Olives is called “the mount of corruption,”\nbecause of the idolatries connected with it.\n\nPsa. 87:4; Psa. 89:10 (11). Isa. 51:9.-Egypt is called Rahab on\naccount of its pride 620, Rachab, having this signification). This\njudgment of Egypt is in Isa. 30:1-14.\nIsa. 14:4.-The Antichrist is called “the King of Babylon,” because he is\nthe end and final outcome of Babel.\nIsa. 29:1.-Jerusalem is called Ariel, which means the Lion of God. It is\nso called to denote its greatness, glory, and strength (cf. [Note: f.\nCompare (for Latin, confer).] 258. 23:20. 1Ch. 14:22), and is thus put\nin contrast with the woe here pronounced against it. (See under\nEllipsis, page 5).\n\nJer. 25:26.-“And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” Here\nSheshach is put for Babylon.\n\nThe subject is the cup of the fury of the God of Israel (verse 15).\nFour classes of nations were to drink of it, and all at one time. (1)\nJerusalem and the cities of Judah (18). (2) Egypt, etc. (19). (3) The\nmingled nations (20-22), and (4) the nations further off (23-25), and,\nfinally, “the king of Sheshach.” In Jeremiah “the times of the Gentiles”\nare not within the scope of his prophecy. Nor in Ezekiel. Daniel, on the\nother hand, fills in these present times, and makes but little reference\nto what goes before or comes after, as in Jeremiah and Ezekiel.\nThe point is that the judgment of these nations takes place all at\nthe same time with that of “the king of Sheshach,” and that time is\nveiled in the Enigma contained in this peculiar name. Babylon is\nmeant; and, according to the ancient Kabbalah, the last letter of the\nalphabet was put for the first, and the penultimate for the second, and\nthe antepenultimate for the third, and so on. By which Enigma the\nword “Sheshach” (029) spells Babel (29). So that the final\njudgment upon the nations is yet future, when Babylon shall have\nbeen restored, and when “Great Babylon” “comes into remembrance.”\nSee further under Paronomasia and Amphibologia.\n\nEze. 23:4.-Jerusalem is called “Aholibah”: i.e., my tabernacle is in her.\nWhile Samaria (Israel) is called Aholah: i.e., his (own) tabernacle.\nThere is a depth of meaning, therefore, in each name.\n\nHos. 4:15; Hos. 10:5.-Bethel (the house of God, Gen. 28:19; Gen.\n28:22) was made, by Jeroboam, a house of his idol (1Ki. 12:29).\nHence, God gives it another name, and calls it Beth-Aven: i.e., the\nhouse of vanity.',''),(143,143,'gnome','|. As to their Internal form, i.e., the sense as distinct from the\nwords\nIn the consideration of Quotations, care must be taken to note what is\nsaid to be “spoken,” and what is said to be “written.” Some prophecies\nwere written and never spoken; some were spoken by the Prophet\nand afterwards written down in his “prophecies”; others were “spoken”\nand never written down at all, and when, therefore, a passage is\nquoted as having been “spoken,” we may or may not find it written\ndown in the Old Testament Scriptures. But when it is said to have\nbeen “written,” then we shall find it surely written down in the\nScriptures of truth.\n\nSurely there is all the difference in the world between τὸ ῥηθέν (to\nrheethen), that which was spoken, and ὁ γέγραπται (ho gegraptai),\nthat which standeth written.\n\nThere is a further consideration which will help us when the\nquotations are prophecies. Prophecy is the utterance of the Lord-\nJehovah: He Who was and is and is to come. His words, therefore,\nmay often have a past, present and future reference.\n\nProphecy frequently has all three: (1) the reference to the events\nat the time of its utterance; (2) a subsequent reference to some great\ncrisis; and (3) a final consummation, which shall fulfil and exhaust it.\n\nWhen a prophecy is said, therefore, to be “fulfilled,” that exhausts\nit. In other cases, where that final fulfilment is still future, the quotation\nis general-“as it is written,” or some such indefinite reference.\n\nThe mistake made by most students of prophecy consists in this:\nthat they do not bear in mind this threefold aspect of prophecy; but\ntake one part, and put it for the whole.\n\nFor example, with regard to the prophecy in Dan. 11:1-45 There\nwas a reference to Antiochus Epiphanes, now past; but this neither\nfulfilled nor exhausted the prophecy; which waits for the yet future\nrevelation of one who shall fill it full: while there may be a historical\nreference to the course of events between. Each is true as part of the\ngeneral fulfilment; but neither contains the whole truth embodied in the\nfulness of the prophetic record.\n\nAn example of this may be seen in the very first recorded fulfilment\nof prophecy in the New Testament (Mat. 1:23 below). We there see\nhow the same Holy Spirit who first inspired that prophecy afterwards\nHimself interprets and applies it.\n\n\\\n\n1. Where the sense originally intended by the Holy Spirit is\n\npreserved, though the words may vary\nMat. 1:23.-“Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a\nson, and they shall call his name Emmanuel.”\n\nThis prophecy was “spoken” by Isaiah to Ahaz (Isa. 7:13-14), and\nafterwards written down. It was first spoken with special reference to\nAhaz and the circumstances then existing; but was afterwards fulfilled\nand quoted with reference to the event which the prophet, who was\nmerely “the mouth,” did not understand, but which the Lord really\nintended. The words differ from both the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX.\nThe Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , but the sense is the same.\n\nIt never had or could have a proper fulfilment, except in Christ, for\nno virgin ever conceived and bore a child. In the days of Isaiah a\ncertain woman, who was a virgin at the time when the prophecy was\nuttered, afterwards brought forth a son, whom they were told to name\n“Emmanuel”; and, before that child was old enough to know how to\nrefuse the evil and choose the good, the deliverance promised to King\nAhaz was wrought for him. But this prophecy did not have its complete\nand proper fulfilment in the days of Ahaz, because a real virgin did not\nconceive and bring forth a real Emmanuel.\n\nThis is not a prophecy, therefore, where the original sense is\nmodified; for this was the sense in which it was originally intended,\nalthough there was a preliminary and partial fulfilment at the time.*\n[Note: See Number in Scripture (page 63) by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nMat. 2:6.-Quoted from Mic. 5:2 (1).

Where the sense is accommodated, being quite different from that\nwhich was first intended, and the sense is accommodated by analogy\nto quite a different event or circumstance\n\nHence this particular form of the figure is called ACCOMMODATIO.\nMat. 2:15.-“Out of Egypt have | called my son,” which agrees with the\nHebrew of Hos. 11:1, and not with the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint\nVersion (325 b.c.).] , which has “have | sent for his ({6., Israel\'s)\nchildren.”\n\nMat. 2:17-18.-From Jer. 31:15 : but differs both from the Heb. and the\nLXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] (38:15). The sense\nof each is given, but is accommodated to the new circumstances.\n\nMat. 8:17.-Quoted from Isa. 53:4, but differing from the LXX [Note: XX\nThe Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , and exactly answering to the\nHebrew. The sense is accommodated; for, whereas the Spirit in Isaiah\nuses the words of Christ bearing our spiritual infirmities and sins in His\npassion and death (as shown in 1Pe. 2:24-25), the same Spirit uses\nthem in Matthew, and accommodates them to other circumstances,\nviz., to Christ\'s healing people of their bodily sicknesses (Mat. 8:16).\nBut this only shows the wonderful fulness of the Divine words.\nMat. 13:35.-Quoted from Psa. 78:2 : but the sense in which Christ\nused them was different from that in the Psalm, where they are used\nof the past history of Israel: here they are accommodated by Christ,\nthe Speaker, to the present circumstances. The words are said to be\n“fulfilled,” because, though the agent or speaker knew not of this\nultimate use of the words, the Holy Spirit, Who spake by him,\nforeknew it. The words are said to be “spoken by the prophet,” and so\nthey were (see Psa. 78:1-2), though they were afterwards written\ndown.\n\nThe actual words differ both from the Heb. and the LXX [Note: XX\nThe Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , 85 well as from the sense which\nis accommodated to them.\n\nChrist was making known concerning that Kingdom certain things\nwhich would happen on its rejection. These things were not the\nsubject of Old Testament prophecy, but had been “kept secret,” and\nare therefore called “the mysteries of (or secrets concerning) the\nkingdom.”\n\nMat. 15:8-9.-Quoted from Isa. 29:13, according to the Septuagint, but\naccommodated to different circumstances from those to which the\nwords referred when first spoken.\n\nMat. 27:9-10.-“Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah\nthe prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\nof him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\nAnd gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.”\n\nIn the margin the reference given is Zec. 11:12-13 : but the words\ndiffer so widely both from the Heb. and the Septuagint that it is more\nthan doubtful whether this can be the passage which is said to be\nfulfilled.\n\nAs no such passage is found in Jeremiah, the difficulty is\nsupposed to be very great. As an example of misapplied ingenuity, we\ngive the various attempts which have been made by way of evading\nthe difficulty:\n\n1. It was a mistake of Matthew’s memory. This was Augustine’s\nopinion, followed by Alford, who says: “The citation is not from\nJeremiah, and is probably quoted from memory and unprecisely.”\n\n2. The reading, “Jeremiah” is spurious. (Rupert von Deutz and\nothers).\n\n3. It occurs in a work of Jeremiah’s which has been lost. (Origen\nand others).\n\n4. It was in Jeremiah, but the Jews have expunged it. (Eusebius).\n5. That, Because Jeremiah, in the Talmud, and some MSS.,\ncommences the “latter” prophets, his name is put for the whole body\nof their writings which would include Jeremiah. (Lightfoot, Adam Clark,\nScrivener, and others).\n\n6. Wordsworth boldly asserts that the mistake was purposely\nmade; the name Jeremiah being substituted for Zechariah in order to\nteach us not to depend on the prophets who were merely channels\nand not the sources of Divine Truth.\n\nConcerning this Alford says: “I put it to any faithful Christian to say,\nwhether of the two presents the greater obstacle to his faith, the\nsolution given above (see No. 1 above), or that given in Wordsworth’s\nnote.”\n\n7. Others again think Matthew’s mistake arose from the Jewish\ntradition “Zechariam habuisse spiritum Jeremioe” (“Zechariah had the\nspirit of Jeremiah”).\n\nNeed we say, with regard to these seven, that\n\n1. Is improbable: inasmuch as he quotes Zechariah elsewhere\n(21:5, 26:31).\n2. Is devoid of MS. authority, which is essential in a case of this\nkind. Origen and Eusebius suspect it, but only conjecturally.\n\n3. This, too, is only a conjecture.\n\n4. So with this.\n\n5. This has more weight, but is unlikely and unsatisfactory: so\nevidently a make-shift.\n\n6. We admire Wordsworth’s faith in the accuracy of the Bible more\nthan Alford’s free handling of the Word: but it is, after all, a wild\nconjecture.\n7. The same is the case with this.\n\nNow these are just the sort of explanations which do more harm\nthan all the assaults of the enemies of the Bible. But they serve to\nprove the truth of inspiration, in that the Bible still stands in spite of all\nthe defences of its friends!\n\nIf it be a quotation from Zechariah, it can be so only by\naccommodation, or by composition (see below page 797, “composite\nquotations”), in which case it combines four different quotations:-\n\n(a) “They took the thirty pieces of silver,” which is derived from the\nnarrative, with special reference to Zechariah;\n\n(0) “The price of him that was valued,” also after Zechariah.\n\n(c) “Whom they bought of the children of Israel” (A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg.\n{Note: arg. Margin.] ) as Joseph was bought and sold. After Gen.\n37:1-36 :\n\n(d) “And gave them for the potter’s field,” the narrative of the text,\nwith a special reference to Zechariah.\n\n(e) “As the Lord appointed me,” which is from Jer. 32:6; Jer. 32:8,\nand connects the transaction in Matthew with that in Jer. 32:1-44 A\nfield was bought in each case; and the latter, like the former, has\nspecial reference to the future. Thus they treasured up a witness\nagainst their own perfidy, while Jeremiah witnessed to the Lord’s\nfaithfulness.\n\nBut in reality, all these so-called explanations are utterly beside the\npoint, and are not only unnecessary, but absolutely worthless. The\nmention of them here would be a waste of paper and printer’s ink,\nexcept that they testify to the fact that, like most other difficulties, this\none is first invented and put into the text, and then it is wrestled with,\nand the text wrested.\n\nThere is not a word about the prophecy being written in Jeremiah\nat all. It says τὸ ῥηθέν (to rheethen) “that which was SPOKEN”: but\nthese clever critics practically take the trouble to exchange these two\nwords, and put in two others 6 γέγραπται (ho gegraptai), or ἦν\nγεγραμµένον (een gegrammenon), “that which is written.” And then,\nhaving made the assertion that it was written in Jeremiah, they have to\nshow cause why it cannot be found there.\n\nSome prophecies were written and never (so far as we know)\nspoken at all; others were both spoken and written; while some were\nspoken and never written.\nIt says: “That which was SPOKEN by Jeremiah the prophet.”\nSurely it is neither suspicion nor conjecture, nor “unprecise” to\nmaintain that it was thus “spoken.” Who can prove that it was not\n“spoken by Jeremiah?”\n\nTrue, Zechariah may have written down similar words, though not\nreferring to the same circumstances; but it ought never to have\noccurred to anyone to say that Mat. 27:9-10 was quoted from what is\nwritten by Zechariah, when it positively states that it was “spoken by\nJeremiah.”\n\nAct. 13:40-41.-Quoted from Hab. 1:5, according to the LXX [Note: ХХ\nThe Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , but accommodated to another set\nof circumstances, and to the Romans rather than to the Chaldeans.\nRom. 9:27-28.-Quoted from Isa. 10:22-23, nearly according to the\nLXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\nRom. 9:29.-Quoted Isa. 1:9, according to the LXX. [Note: XX. The\nSeptuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\nRom. 10:6-8.-Where what the Scripture (or, rather, “the righteousness\nwhich is of faith) “saith” (Deu. 30:12-14) is accommodated to different\ncircumstances-verses 6 and 8 agreeing with the LXX [Note: XX The\nSeptuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ‚ and verse 7 differing from it.\n1Co. 1:19-20.-Quoted from Isa. 29:14; Isa. 33:18, and differing from\nthe LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , as well as\naccommodated to other circumstances.\n\n1Co. 10:6; 1Co. 10:11.-“These things happened unto them for\nensamples.” Where the events cited are used and accommodated to\nour sins and infirmities.\n\nRev. 1:7.-An allusion to Zec. 12:10.\n\nRev. 1:17.-An allusion to Isa. 41:4; Isa. 44:6, but differing from the\nLXxX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\nRev. 11:4.-Quoted from Zec. 4:14, differing both from the Heb. and the\nLXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ‚ and\naccommodated to different circumstances.\n\nIl. As to their External form (i.e., the words, as distinct from the\n\nsense)\n\n1. Where the words are from the Hebrew, or from the Septuagint\nMat. 2:15, from Hos. 11:1; Mat. 2:6, from Mic. 5:2 (1); Mat. 12:18-21,\nfrom Isa. 42:1-4. These and other passages are from the Hebrew and\nnot from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\nLuk. 4:18 quoted from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).] of Isa. 61:1-2. We have already instanced this as a\ncitation in which the original sense is preserved. But we repeat it here\nbecause the words are varied.\n\n“The Spirit of the Lord (Heb., Adonai Jehovah) is upon me\nbecause he (Heb., Jehovah) hath anointed me to preach the Gospel\nto the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach\ndeliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind.” Thus\nfar we have the words of the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).] The last sentence “the recovering of sight to the blind,” not\nbeing in the Hebrew Text* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible, which\ngives two readings.] ; while the last sentence in the Hebrew is not in\nthe LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] But the two\nwords in the Hebrew contain both senses. 22? (pahkach) means\nsimply to open. Spoken once of the ears (58. 42:20); and often of the\neyes (2Ki. 4:35; 2Ki. 6:17; 2Ki. 6:20; 2Ki. 19:16. Dan. 9:18. Job. 27:19.\nPro. 20:13. Jer. 32:19. Isa. 42:7). Hence the first of the two words\nmeans to open the eyes of: and the other word means prison. Thus, in\nreading, the sense of the first word was expanded and given in the\nwords of Isa. 42:7; while that of the second word was expanded and\ngiven in the words of Isa. 58:6 -the two together meaning that the eyes\nof the prisoners should be opened on being released from the\ndarkness of their prison. Or, to open [their eyes, and open or release]\nthe prisoners. The explanation lies in the fact that the eyelids were\ncalled “the doors” of the eyes (222222, aphappayim) (Psa. 132:4.\nPro. 6:4. Job. 16:16, etc.). Hence the term “to open” applies equally to\nthe eyes and to prison doors.\n2. Where the words are varied by omission, addition, or\ntransposition\n\nMat. 4:10 and Luk. 4:8.-“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,” from\nDeu. 6:13; Deu. 10:20; and then the Lord added His own Divine\nconclusion from this: “And Him only shalt thou serve.”\n\nThe Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.).] have “fear”: but the fear of God includes the worship of God;\nand as worship was the matter in question (see Mat. 4:9), the\nφοβηθήση (phobeetheesee), thou shalt fear, of the LXX. [Note: XX.\nThe Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] is changed by the Lord to\nπροσκυνήσεις (proskuneeseis), thou shalt worship.\nMat. 4:15-16, from Isa. 9:1-2 (8:23; 9:1). Here, the quotation differs\nboth from the Hebrew and from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint\nVersion (325 b.c.).] But this is partly an accommodation; because in\nIsaiah (LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ) it is\nprophecy, while in the Gospel it is fulfilment that is in question.\n\nMat. 5:31, from Deu. 24:1 : but here it is not given as an exact\nquotation. It introduces the words by the simple formula: “It hath been\nsaid,” implying that those who thus said, put their own meaning on\nwhat the Law said.\n\nMat. 12:18-21, from Isa. 42:1-4. Here, the Gospel differs from the LXX\n{Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , scarcely a word being\nthe same till we come to the last clause. It differs, too, from the\nHebrew in the last clause, because it records the act of “fulfilment,”\nand not merely the words of the prophecy. The words, therefore take\nthe form of a Divine comment or re-statement.\n\nMat. 19:5.-“And they twain” (οἱ δύο, hoi duo). These words are added\nto the usual text of Gen. 2:24 : and yet the sense is the same, for only\nof two were these words spoken. The quotation agrees with the LXX.\n[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\nMat. 22:24.-From Deu. 25:5-6. But here it is the Sadducees, who do\nnot quote, but merely give the substance of the matter under the loose\nformula “Moses said.”\n\nRom. 11:3-4.-From 1Ki. 19:10; 1Ki. 19:14; 1Ki. 19:18. Here neither the\nHeb. nor the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] is\nfollowed, but the facts are recorded; while the destruction of the altars\nand the killing of the prophets are transposed.\n\n1Co. 2:9.-From Isa. 64:4 (3). It is clear from this that the formula, “As it\nis written,” refers to the sense rather than to the words; and that the\nDivine Author, in repeating the words, sometimes varied them, as He\ndoes here; first, by transposing the hearing and the seeing; and then,\nby adding “neither have entered into the heart of man,” thus varying\nboth from the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).]\n\nMoreover, He employs the general sentiment in a particular case.\nFor what is said in the abstract, and universally, in Isaiah, is here put\nin contrast to some particular things which are revealed. See verse 10.\n1Со. 14:21.-From Isa. 28:11-12. Here the quotation differs both from\nthe Heb. and the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] :\nand is accommodated to the new circumstances by the omission of\nthe middle passage, which was not relevant.\n1Pe. 1:24-25.-From Isa. 40:6-8. Here the words are not introduced by\nany formula as a quotation. Isa. 40:1-31 is referred to; and certain\nwords are used again by the same Author: and, therefore, some are\nomitted; as not being relevant, or necessary for the purpose in hand.\n3. Where the words are changed by a reading, or an inference; or\nin number, person, mood, or tense\n\nWe all constantly thus quote the Scriptures: and, in adapting them by\napplication to some special circumstance, we depart from the original\ninterpretation as to the special circumstances connected with them,\nand do not hesitate to change a tense, or number, or person, etc.\n\nIt is no less authoritative, as Scripture, nor does it alter the word of\nGod.\n\n(a) By a different reading\n\nHeb. 10:5 (7).-“A body hast thou prepared me.”\n\nThese words are like the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).] of Psa. 40:6 (39:6), and differ from the Hebrew, which is,\n“Mine ears hast thou opened.”\nBut this is not given as a quotation. It does not say, “as it is\nwritten”; but it gives the words which “he saith,” “when he cometh into\nthe world.” What he then said in the accomplishment of a prophecy\nmust certainly differ from the form in which the event was foretold and\nwritten centuries before.\n\nWhat we have here is an adaptation or accommodation (see\nabove page 786) of a prophecy; and the words are changed to make it\nsuit the actual fulfilment of the prophecy.\n\nIt consists of four lines arranged alternately:-\n\nа “Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;\n\nЬ Mine ears hast thou opened:\n\nа Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required;\n\nЬ — Then said I, Lo, | come ... to do thy will, О my God.”\n\nHere in a and a we have sacrifices; while in b and b we have\nobedience.\n\nThis is another statement of the truth in 1Sa. 15:22 :\n\na “To obey\n\nЬ — 15 better than sacrifice,\nа And to hearken\nЬ — Than the fat of rams.”\n\nHere, again, we have obedience and sacrifice set in contrast. And\nthat is exactly what we have in Heb. 10:5, except that the obedience is\ndifferently expressed.\n\nIn Psa. 40:6, the symbol is the opening or boring of the ears, which\nis in harmony with Isa. 50:5; Isa. 48:8; and an allusion to Exo. 19:5;\nExo. 21:5-6; and Deu. 15:16-17; while the contrast is in harmony with\n198. 15:22 and Jer. 7:22. The boring of the ears signifies the voluntary\nacceptance of bond-service, and the promise to perform it. But in Heb.\n10:5 we have not the promise (as in Psa. 40:6), but the actual\nperformance, and therefore the words are changed by the One who\ncame to do that will of God. Surely He had the right to change them,\nand to state as a fact, “A body hast thou prepared me” in which to\nobey, and by that perfect obedience unto death to do that which is\n“better than sacrifice.” The “great delight” (1Sa. 15:22) of the Father is\nexpressed in Mat. 3:17, as well as foretold in Isa. 42:1.\n\nHeb. 11:21.-This is not a quotation; but, as it is generally treated as\nsuch, and as being in discrepancy with Gen. 47:31, we refer the\nreader to Hysteresis (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ).\n\n(b) By an inference\nMat. 2:6.-Here we have several changes by way of inference and\nexplanation, bringing out more of the meaning of the words in the\nprophet. Mic. 5:2 (1) reads (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ):\n“But thou Bethlehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the\nthousands of Judah, out of thee shall One come forth unto me that is\nto be ruler in Israel.”\n\nIn Mat. 2:6 we have “land of Judah” instead of Ephrathah, which\nwas its ancient name (see Gen. 35:16-19; Gen. 48:7), as being better\nunderstood by Herod.\n\nInstead of the positive “art little,” we have the negative, “art in no\nwise least,” because, though little in the time of Micah, yet now, after\nthe birth of the Messiah (Mat. 1:1-25), it could no longer be so called,\nin view of the event which had given the city true greatness.\n\nInstead of “thousands,” we have the Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee.] ), properly translated “princes,” because Messiah was the Prince\nof princes.\n\nInstead of “be ruler,” we have “be shepherd of” (A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] rule,\nmargin feed). This explanation brings in the next verse but one in\nMicah (“He shall stand and shall feed.”)\nFinally, the words of the prophet, “unto me,” are omitted, because\nthe emphasis is now on the fact rather than the purpose (though both\nwere true); and hence the reason is given in the word “for,” and the\nfact is added in the words, “my people.”\nAct. 7:43.-Here the citation differs both from the Hebrew and LXX\n[Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] (Amo. 5:25-27) in\nwords; but, by Divine inference other facts and truths are referred to.\n\nInstead of using the Hebrew name “Chiun,” in Amo. 5:26, the\nGreek equivalent, “Remphan,” is used.* [Note: Just as “Ethiopia” is\nused for the Hebrew “Koosh”; “Egypt” for “Mizraim’; “Syria” and\n“Mesopotania’” for the Hebrew “Aram.”]\n\nInstead of saying “the figures which ye made for yourselves,” the\nobject for which they were made is given by Him, who knew their\nhearts-“figures which ye made to worship them,” thus bringing out and\nemphasising their idolatry.\n\nInstead of saying “beyond Damascus,” Stephen says: “beyond\nBabylon.” But this is no “scribal error,” or “inadvertence,” as critics\nassert.\n\nEven the stoutest defenders of verbal inspiration read both Amos\nand Acts, as though they both “referred to the Babylonian exile,” and\ndo not appear to notice that it says” beyond” Babylon.\n\nThe fact is that it is “the house of Israel” as distinct from Judah that\nis spoken of in Act. 7:42, and in Amos; and, while Judah was taken\naway to Babylon, Israel was taken “beyond” Babylon. Amos speaking\nbefore either captivity (about 780 b.c.) says: “beyond Damascus’; or,\nbeyond where Damascus will go captive. See Amo. 1:5.\n\nIn other words, in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit alludes to the\ncountry, and refers to Assyria, and says “beyond Damascus”; while\nspeaking by Stephen, in the light of all the past history, He alludes to\nthe fact that Israel was removed farther than Judah, for while Judah\nwas taken away fo Babylon, Israel was removed “beyond” it.\n\nRom. 9:27.-“Though the number of the children of Israel be as the\nsand of the sea” (so LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.).] ). In Isa. 10:22 it is, “Though thy People Israel be as the sand of\nthe sea,” etc. Here, by way of inference, the same people are\nmentioned in other words.\n\nRom. 9:29 is referred to as a difference in reading. “Except the Lord of\nSabaoth had left us a seed” (σπέρµα, sperma). In Isa. 1:9 it is “Except\nthe Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant (2222, sareed), but\nsareed means the same thing exactly, though the words differ. The\nseed that is left will form the remnant, and the “remnant” that is left will\nconsist of the “seed.”\n\nRom. 9:33.-“Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.” This,\nin Isa. 28:16, is “He that believeth shall not make haste.”\nThe Hebrew (222, chiish), means to flee, flee away, hence, of\nthe feelings, to be excited. Rom. 9:33 is the Divine inference from this,\nfor he who really believes has no need for fleeing or for excitement;\nbut can patiently wait for and expect the fulfilment of the Divine\npromises. Hence, he will have no ground for that shame which causes\nothers to run away.\n\nEph. 4:8.-This is supposed to be a case where there is a difference of\nreading. The English is: “and gave gifts unto men.” But the Hebrew of\nPsa. 68:18 (19) is: “Thou hast received gifts for men.”\n\nIn the Psalm we have the prophecy “that Jah Elohim might dwell\namong them”; while in the Epistle we have the fulfilment in the gifts\nreceived being “actually” given, and the Lord God dwelling in the midst\nof His People by the Holy Spirit. But apart from this it ought to be\nnoted that the Hebrew °??? (/akach) has the double and beautiful\nsense of first receiving and then giving: i.e., receive and give what is\nreceived. Hence it is often rendered “to fetch.” See Gen. 18:5; Gen.\n27:13; Gen. 42:16. Exo. 27:20 “bring.” Lev. 24:2 “bring.” 2Ki. 2:20\n“bring.”\nWe ought, however, to note that in the Psalm we have 2222\n(baadam) with the article: i.e., in the man. So that we may render it:\n“Thou didst receive gifts in human nature”: i.e., as “the Son of man”\n(compare Mat. 28:18. Joh. 13:3). He did give gifts to men.\n\n(c) In number\nMat. 4:7.-“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” In Deu. 6:16 it is:\n“Ye shall not tempt.” If the command is given to all in general, then\nsurely it applies to each individual in particular: and so the Lord\napplied it in reply to the Tempter.\nRom. 4:7.-“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.” In Psa.\n32:1 it is in the singular number: “Blessed is he,” etc.\n\nBut this is not a direct quotation. It is introduced by the words:\n“David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God\nimputed righteousness without works [saying] Blessed are they whose\niniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the\nman to whom the Lord will not impute sin.”\n\nBut in the Hebrew the word “man” (22?) does not occur until\nverse 2. In verse 1 it is literally “O the happinesses of the forgiven of\ntransgression: the covered of sin.” And this singular may be used of a\nforgiven People collectively, and be Divinely expanded according to its\nsense: “Blessed are they.”\n\nIn both places the plural is meant, the singular being put for it in\nthe former case only by Synecdoche (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see-] ).\n\nRom. 10:15.-“How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the\nGospel of peace.”\n\nIn Isa. 52:7 the Heb. is “the feet of him,” the singular being put by\nSynecdoche for the plural, just as “the feet” are put (the part for the\nwhole) for the person who preaches.\n\n(d) In person\nExamples of this may be found under Heterosis of Person. See above,\nwhere one person is put for another.\n(e) In mood and tense\nExamples of this may be found under Heterosis of the Verb. See\nabove.\n\nOne illustration may be given in Mat. 13:14-15, where (in the\nquotation of Isa. 6:10) the indicative mood is put by Heterosis for the\nimperative.\n4. Where several citations are amalgamated. Composite\nquotations\nSometimes a number of separate sentences are drawn from different\npassages and presented as one connected passage.\n\nThis is a common use practised generally in all literature. Dr.\nFranklin Johnson* [Note: The Quotations of the New Testament from\nthe Old considered in the light of general literature, pp. 92-102.] gives\nsome interesting examples from various authors.\n\nPlato, in his /оп (p. 538), quotes two lines from Homer pieced\ntogether by Plato himself, the first from liad xi., line 638; and the\nsecond, line 630, col. 629.\n\nXenophon (Memorabilia, bk. |., ch. 2, sec. 58) quotes connectedly\nas one passage, two passages from Homer (Iliad ii., 188 5αα. [Note:\nqq. Following.] and 198 sqq. [Note: qq. Following.]\n\nLucian, in his Charon (sec. 22), runs five lines together from\nHomer. But Jacobitzt [Note: Lucian i., p. 39.] shows that they are\nbrought together from different passages: viz.: Iliad ix. 319, 320, and\nOdyssey x. 521; xi. 539.\n\nPlutarch, in his treatise on Progress in Virtue, treats two separate\nlines of Homer as a single sentence, viz., Odyssey vi. 187 and xxiv.\n402.\n\nCicero, in De Oratore, book ΙΙ., sec. 80, quotes from the Andria of\nTerence, making up in two lines parts of Terence’s lines 117, 128 and\n129.\n\nPhilo, in his treatise, Who is the heir of divine things? sec. 5,\nquotes, as one address of Moses, parts of two, viz., Num. 11:13; Num.\n22:1-41, but both refer to the same matter.\n\nIn the same treatise (sec. 46) he runs together parts of Gen.\n18:14; Gen. 17:19.\nConybeare and Howson (Life and Epistles of St. Paul, vol. Ι., p.\n54) quote, as one passage, parts of Psa. 122:4; Psa. 68:27 (28);\n122:5, 2, 6, 7; and 68:35 (36). And these are not accompanied by any\nreferences or explanation.\n\nRuskin, in his Modern Painters, vol. V., p. 146, quotes as one\npassage: “How | love thy law! It is my meditation all the day. Thy\ntestimonies are my delight and my counsellors; sweeter also than\nhoney and the honeycomb.” All these four sentences are from the\nPsalms. The first two are from Psa. 119:97; Psa. 119:24; Psa. 19:10\n(11).\n\nAll these composite quotations are made up of sentences that\nrelate to the same subject. And this is always true of those which we\nfind in the Scriptures.\n\nNot so when man quotes the Scriptures in this manner. When he\nthus strings texts together it is a very different matter; and, though\nsometimes harmless, it is often dangerous, and is a practice greatly to\nbe deprecated. By a system, which may be called text-garbling, he is\nable to support his own theories and views.\n\nWe recently saw two texts (quotations) thus connected in order to\nsupport Fasting, though they relate to totally distinct subjects: “The\nLord Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights. Do this in remembrance\nof Me.” This is a flagrant example, but less likely to harm than many\nothers which are less glaring and more specious.\n\nQuite different are those examples in which the Holy Spirit Himself\ntakes His own words and thus links them together, making one subject\nof them, even though that subject cannot be discerned by us in the\nseparate passages.\n\nThe following are examples:-\n\nMat. 21:5.-“Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king cometh unto\nthee,” etc.\n\nThis is a composite quotation, the first sentence, “Tell ye,” etc.,\nbeing taken from Isa. 62:11, and the latter contracted from Zec. 9:9.\n\nIn Mat. 21:13 (Mar. 11:17, and Luk. 19:46), the Lord exclaimed: “It is\nwritten, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have\nmade it a den of thieves.” The first half of this is from Isa. 56:7, and\nthe second slightly altered from Jer. 7:11. In both passages (which\nagree with the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ) the\nsubject is the same; viz., the Temple, and the right use of it.\n\nMar. 1:2-3.-“As it is written in the prophets, Behold,” etc.\nThe prophets quoted are Mal. 3:1, and Isa. 40:3.\nLuk. 1:16-17 is from Mal. 4:5-6 (3:23, 24) and 3:1.\nAct. 1:20 is made up from Psa. 69:25 (26), and 109:8, and differs both\nfrom the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.)]\nRom. 3:10-18 is a long quotation made up of the following passages,\nwhich all refer to the same subject. They are composed of two\nclasses, the general and the particular; verses 10-12 are taken from\nEcc. 7:20. Psa. 14:2-3; Psa. 53:2-3 (3, 4), which speak generally of\nthe universality of sin; while the second kind, verses 13-18, taken from\nPsa. 5:9 (10). Isa. 59:7-8, and Psa. 36:1 (2) proves the same thing;\nbeing the manifestations of sin in particular cases. Thus two methods\nof proof by induction are employed: and yet some, “forgetting their\nlogic” (as Dr. Franklin Johnson says), see a difficulty in this simple\nmethod of proof which is common to all writers of all ages, and of\nvarious languages.\n\nIt should be noted that in these cases the reasoning is always\ncorrectly from the general to the particular; and not, as is so often the\ncase with man, from the particular to the general: which is false in\nlogic and fatal as to the argument.\nRom. 9:33 is made up from Isa. 28:16; Isa. 8:14. Varied both from the\nHeb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\nRom. 11:8 is made up from Isa. 29:10 and Deu. 29:4.\n\nRom. 11:26-27 is made up from Isa. 59:20-21; Isa. 27:9, and agreeing\nwith the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\n\n1Co. 15:54-55 is made up from Isa. 25:8, and Hos. 13:14, and varied\nboth from the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version\n(325 b.c.).]\n\n2Co. 6:16 is made up from Lev. 26:11-12 and Eze. 37:27, and is\nvaried from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]\nGal. 3:8 is made up from Gen. 12:3; Gen. 18:18.\n\nHeb. 9:19-20 is made up from Exo. 24:6-8, and Num. 19:6.\n\n1Pe. 2:7 is made up from Psa. 118:22 and Isa. 8:14.\n\nObjectors have made a difficulty of these composite quotations, as\nthough the Holy Spirit, the Author of the words as well as of the Word,\nmay not repeat, vary, or combine His words in any way He pleases:\nand as though He were to be denied the right claimed and practised\nby writers in all ages.\nSo far from seeing a difficulty in this, we may learn many important\nlessons from these variations, which are nothing less than Divine\nComments on the Divine Word by the Divine Author.\n\n5. Where quotations are front secular works, or books other than\nthe Bible\n\nSometimes the Holy Spirit quotes words from secular and human\n\nwritings, and either thus endorses the truth of the statement, or uses it\n\nagainst those who believed it and accepted it as truth.\n\nNot all, however, that are generally considered as quotations are\nreally so. For example: “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses”\n(2Ti. 3:8) is said to be a quotation from the Targum of Jonathan ben\nUzziel upon Exo. 7:11. But the Holy Spirit may give this independently,\nas a fact, quite apart from the Targum altogether; while many believe\nthe Targum to be of a later date.\n\nSo, too, the prophecy of Enoch in Jud. 1:14-15 may just as well be\nthe foundation on which the so-called “Book of Enoch” was afterwards\nmade up, as a quotation made from that book. We certainly prefer to\nbelieve that the book of Enoch was originated from Jud. 1:14-15; and,\ntaking this as the starting point, other prophecies were concocted and\nadded by some old and unknown writer.\n\nThe same applies to Jud. 1:9 concerning the controversy between\nMichael and the Devil about the body of Moses. This Scriptural\nstatement was the original centre round which numberless fancies and\nfictions subsequently gathered, and from which the traditions started.\n\nOn the other hand, there are three certain undoubted\nquotationsfrom secular writings. We will give them all.\n\nThe first is:-\n\nAct. 17:28.-“For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as\ncertain also of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his\noffspring’ (τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν, tou gar kai genos esmen).” This is\nan exact quotation from Aratus, a native of Tarsus; who, being a poet,\nhad been requested by Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, and\nKing of Macedonia (273-239 b.c.), to put into poetry an astronomical\nwork of Eudoxus (an astronomer of Cnidus, 403-350 b.c.), called\nPhainomena. This he did about 270 b.c., and he called his work\nDiosemeia (i.e., the Divine signs), being a description and explanation\nof the signs of the Zodiac, and the Constellations, as the Greeks then\nunderstood, or rather misunderstood, them.* [Note: See The Witness\nof the Stars, by the same author and publisher.] The poem opens with\npraise of God (Zeus or Jupiter), and these words occur in the fifth\nline:-\n“From Zeus we lead the strain; He whom mankind\nNe’er leave unhymned; of Zeus all public ways,\n\nAll haunts of men, are full; and full the sea,\n\nAnd harbours; and of Zeus all stand in need.\n\nWe are his off spring; and he, ever good to man,\nGives favouring signs, and rouses us to toil,” etc., etc.\n\nSimilar words, ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν (ek sou gar genos esmen)\nare used by Kleanthes (Hymn in Jov. 5), who was born at Assos in\nTroas about 300 b.c. Also in The Golden Verses of Pythagoras.\n\nIn Act. 17:28, the word “poets,” being in the plural; may refer to\nboth of them, while the article in both cases refers to Zeus, or Jupiter.\nThe statement of the quotation was believed by the Greeks, and it is\nused here as an argumentum ad hominem. For it could never be that\nZeus is really Jehovah, or that Jehovah is the “father” of everyone.\nThe “universal fatherhood of God’”-the Devil\'s lie-was the belief of the\nheathen, as well as of most modern “Christian” teachers. But both are\nwrong: for God is “the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and of those\nonly who are “in Christ.” It is to “as many as received Him, to them\n[and to none other] gave He authority to be called the sons of God”\n(Joh. 1:12).\n1Co. 15:33.-“Evil communications (or companionships) corrupt good\nmanners.”\n\nφθείρουσιν ἤθη χρήσθ᾽ ὁμιλίαι кака! (phtheirousin eethee\nchreesth’ homiliai kakai). The words occur in this form, according to\nJerome,t [Note: In his Epistle to the Orator Magnus.] in the Thais of\nMenander. Dr. Burton thinks Menander may have quoted it from\nEuripides. Meyer quotes Plato (Rep. 8:550B).\n\nThese various opinions show that the words were current as a\ncommon place quotation (Paroemia, q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] ), and are\nquoted as such here.\n\nTit. 1:12.-“One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, ‘The\nCretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies’ (i.e., liars, evil wild-\nbeasts, gluttons, lazy). This involves another figure called Oxymoron\n(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ). Jerome¥ [Note: Com. in loco.] says that the\npoet was Epimenides, and that the words occur in his work called de\nOraculis (i.e., of Oracles), whence he is called a “prophet,” either by\nway of irony, or because of the title of his work. Callimachus (a poet of\nCyrene) makes use of these words in a hymn to Jupiter, and satirizes\nthe Cretans for their boast that Jupiter was buried in Crete, whereas\nhe maintains (of course) that Jove was immortal. It was from this that\nOvid said ‘Nec fingunt omnia Ογείες’ (The Cretans do not always lie*\n[Note: See Ovid, A. iii. 10, 19. Ellicott refers to Ovid, de A. А., i. 298.\nThis says “quamvis sit mendax, Creta negare potest.” ).\n\nThe origin of all this was that the Cretans had a certain sepulchre\nwith this epitaph: “Here lies one whom they call Jupiter.”\n\nBecause of this, the “Poet” charges them with a lie, saying: “the\nCretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies; therefore (O Jupiter)\nthey have built a Sepulchre for you. But thou hast not died, ... thou\nalways livest,” etc.\n\nBut it has been pointed out (by Archbishop Whately, we believe),\nthat if the Cretans are always liars, this was said by a Cretan,\ntherefore he must have been a liar, and what he said could not be\ntrue! But all this reasoning is set at rest by the Holy Ghost, who says:\n“This testimony is true!”\nIn Act. 17:22-23, we have not, indeed, a quotation, but a reference to\na matter on which contemporary and later writers give confirmatory\nand interesting evidence. “I perceive that in all things ye are unusually\nreligious. For, as | passed by and carefully observed your objects of\nworship, | found an altar also with this inscription; Ἀγνώστῳ θεῷ\n(Agnost6 the6) ‘to an unknown God.’ Whom therefore, not knowing, ye\nreverence, him | make known to you.”\n\nJeromet [Note: Epist. ad Magnum Oratorem Romanum. Vol. Ill.\nOperum, f. 148.] says (speaking of St. Paul); “He learned of the true\nDavid to snatch the sword from the enemy’s hand, and cut off his head\nwith his own weapon.”\n\nLudovicus Vives says} [Note: De Civit, Dei. Book VII., cap. 17.]\n\nthat “in the Attic fields there were very many altars dedicated to\nunknown Gods,” and that “Pausanias in his Attics, speaks of The\nAltars of Unknown Gods, which altars were the invention of\nEpimenides, the Cretan. For, when Attica was visited with a sore\nplague, they consulted the Delphian Oracle, whose answer was\nreported to be: That they must offer sacrifices, but named not the god\nto whom they should be offered. Epimenides, who was then at Athens,\ncommanded§ [Note: Hence called ‘a prophet’ in Tit. 1:12. See The\nMan of God, by the same author and publisher.] that they should send\nthe beasts intended for the sacrifice through the fields, and that the\nsacrificers should follow the beasts with this direction: that, wherever\nthey should stand, there they must be sacrificed to the unknown god,\nin order to pacify his wrath. From that time, therefore, to the time of\nDiogenes Laertius these altars were visited.* [Note: For further\ninformation on this subject, see Sixtus Senensis, book 2, Biblioth Tit.\nArce Athenensis Inscriptio. Also Wolfius, Vol. Ι., Lectionum\nMemorabilium, p. 4, 5:20, etc.]\n\nCol. 2:21.-“Touch not; taste not; handle not.” These ordinances of\nmen were probably prescribed in these words, and are referred to as\nwell known. We know them also to-day; for man is the same, and\nhuman nature is not changed.',''),(144,144,'amphibologia','2Ki. 5:18.-“Go in peace.” This was Elisha’s answer to Naaman, who\nwished to know whether the Lord would pardon if, when he went with\nhis master, the king of Syria into the temple of Rimmon, he bowed\nhimself there.\nElisha’s answer was an Amphibologia: “Go in peace.” If he had\n\nsaid, “Yes; you may bow,” that would have been to sanction idolatry.\nAnd if he had said, “No; you must not bow,” that would have been to\nput Naaman’s conscience under a yoke of bondage to Elisha.\nEze. 12:13.-The term Amphibologia, however, refers more especially\nto a prophecy like that concerning Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Eze.\n12:13 : “I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet\nshall he not see it, though he shall die there.” This prophecy, by itself,\nis almost in the form of an nigma (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ): for it is\ncapable of two interpretations, both of which are true. The other is in\nJer. 34:3 : “Thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon,\nand he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to\nBabylon.”\n\nZedekiah, in his unbelief and perverseness, determined not to\nbelieve either of these prophecies, because he could not understand\nthem. So Josephus tells us. Yet both were perfectly true, as the\nfulfilment proved.\n\nZedekiah had his eyes put out by the king of Babylon at Riblah\n(2Ki. 25:7. Jer. 39:7; Jer. 52:11). He spoke to the king of Babylon, and\nsaw him; and he was afterwards taken to Babylon, but did not see it,\nthough he died there (Eze. 17:16).\nJoh. 19:22.-“What | have written | have written.” Pilate said this to\nconvey two meanings. First, to state a matter of fact; and second, to\ndismiss an inconvenient subject; implying that he did no wish to alter\nwhat he had written, and yet did not declare that he would not. The\nhistory seems to imply that he did afterwards either alter it or permit it\nto be altered. For\n\n(1) The inscription in Joh. 19:19 was written (probably in Latin) and\nput on the cross before it left Pilate’s presence.\n\n(2) The inscription in Mat. 27:37 was written probably in Hebrew,\nand placed over his head, not by the soldiers who nailed him to the\ncross, but by the persons, “they,” who crucified him. This was not so\nplaced until after the garments had been divided, and the soldiers had\n“sat down to watch him there.”\n\n(3) The inscription in Luk. 23:38 appears to have been of Hebrew\norigin (the Hebrew being put last, whereas in Pilate’s (John) the Latin\nwas last). It was not seen till near the sixth hour, and was apparently\nthe cause of the reviling which followed, “Jesus” being omitted from\nMatthew\'s, which seems to have been intermediate between John’s\nand Luke’s, while Mark’s was probably the same as that to which Luke\nrefers and gives merely another translation of the Hebrew.\nIt is impossible for us, now, to know what discussion went on\nduring the day. All that we know is, from Joh. 19:1-42, that the Jews\nearnestly desired to have it altered, and that Pilate did not decidedly\nrefuse at the time. So that it is probable that the discussions\ncontinued, and these different inscriptions are the evidence of it, put\nup in different terms, and at different times: or it may be that it was the\nvarious translations that were so put up.\n\nFrom these considerations we would suggest that the difficulty felt\nas to the variations in the wording of the inscriptions may be removed\nmore easily and satisfactorily by believing that there were at least\nthree inscriptions put up at different times during the day, and that\nthese, being changed, differed from each other. If this be not the\nexplanation then another series of difficulties is created-as to the\nsequence of the events recorded in the different gospels.\n\nOur present suggestion meets both sets of difficulties at once.\nAct. 17:22 is another example. “Ye men of Athens, in all things |\nperceive that ye are very religious.” (See R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] margin, somewhat religious).\n\nThis has two interpretations: for they were truly very “religious,”\nand yet knew nothing of true Christianity.\n\nWe thus learn that Christianity is religion; but religion is not\nnecessarily Christianity.\n\nTo say that a person is religious tells us nothing: for he may be a\nBuddhist, a Mahommedan, a Roman Catholic, or a votary of any other\nreligious system; but it does not follow that such an one is “in Christ,”\nand therefore a. Christian.',''),(145,145,'eironeia','1. Divine Irony:\nWhere the speaker is Divine\nGen. 3:22.-“And the Lord God said: Behold the man is become as one\nof us, to know good and evil.”\n\nMan had not become “as one of us.” He had become a wreck and\nа ruin, even as man. These words call our attention to verse 5, and\nshow how false was the Serpent\'s promise.\nDeu. 32:37.-“And he shall say: Where are their gods, their rock in\nwhom they trusted, Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank\nthe wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be\nyour protection.”\n\nThis is Divine Sarcasm; for their gods were no rock or defence,\nneither did they accept offerings or give help.\nJdg. 10:14.-“Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let\nthem deliver you in the time of your tribulation.” This was Divine\nSarcasm, for those gods could neither hear nor deliver.\nJob. 38:4.-“Where wast thou when | laid the foundations of the earth?”\nVerse 5. “Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who\nhath stretched the line upon it?” So throughout this chapter.\n\nThis is the Divine Sarcasm on all scientists who profess to\nunderstand and tell us all about the earth, its size, and its shape, and\nits weight, etc., etc.\n\nConsidering the various changes which have taken place during\nthe centuries in what is called “science,” we may well lay this question\nto heart, emphasised as it is by being Divine Irony.\n\nPsa. 60:8 (10).-“Philistia triumph thou over me.” This is said ironically;\nfor the truth is put literally in Psa. 108:9 (10): “Over Philistia will |\ntriumph.” See margin and compare Exo. 8:9 (5).\n\nEcc. 11:9 is generally considered to be Irony, but we can hardly so\nregard it. It is almost too solemn to be Irony. It says: Do it; do all this:\n“but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into\njudgment.”\n\nIsa. 2:10.-“Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the\nLord and for the glory of his majesty.” This is /rony: to show that\nneither rocks nor any other shelter can save man from the judgments\nin “the day of the Lord.”\nIsa. 8:9-10.-This /rony is meant to emphasise the fact that; however\nmuch men may unite together against God, it will all come to naught.\nThese are the words of God in the mouth of the prophet.\n\nIsa. 17:3.-“They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel”: {6., the\nglory of Damascus and Syria shall fade as the glory of Israel had\npassed away. The word “glory” is thus marked by Antiphrasis to point\nus to that which had been lost, and the height from which Israel had\nfallen.\n\nIsa. 21:5.-This is God’s message to Babylon: to show that all her\npreparation for defence would not prevent the ultimate cry: “Babylon is\nfallen, is fallen.” See verses 6-9.\n\nIsa. 29:1.-“Woe to Ariel, to Ariel (i.e., the lion of God), the city where\nDavid dwelt!” This glorious title is put by Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which\nsee.] ) for Jerusalem: and, is used here in order to emphasise, by\nIrony, the depth to which the City had fallen from the height of its past\nglory.\n\nIsa. 50:11.-This is Divine Irony to show the vanity of striving for light\nand happiness apart from God. It is a solemn warning for all those to-\nday who are seeking to bring about a millennium without Christ.\n\nIsa. 57:12.-“I will declare thy righteousness and thy works.” These\nwords were addressed, by sarcasm, to an apostate and wicked\nPeople. The word “righteousness,” by Antiphrasis, marks the fact,\nwhich is clear from the words which follow: “For they shall not profit\nthee.” Had the works been really righteous, they would have profited.\nIsa. 57:13.-“When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee.” To\nshow that the abundance of riches or people cannot deliver in the day\nof trouble.\n\nJer. 7:21.-\"Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Put (or\nadd) your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh.” That this\nwas Irony is clear from what follows. They were the sacrifices of\nhypocrites which Jehovah would not accept.\n\nJer. 11:15.-“What hath my beloved to do in mine house?” What\nfollows clearly shows what is meant by the Antiphrasis in the word\n“beloved.”\nJer. 22:20.-“Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in\nBashan, and cry from the passages.” This is Irony, or Sarcasm,\naddressed to the family of Jehoiakim, who looked to Egypt for help\nagainst the king of Babylon: but 2Ki. 24:7 tells us that “the king of\nEgypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon\nhad taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that\npertained to the king of Egypt.” It was no use, therefore, for Jehoiakim\nto go up to the passes of Lebanon or Bashan and cry out for those\nwho before had helped.\n\nJer. 46:9.-The words of God to Egypt. Shown to be /rony by verse 10.\nJer. 46:11.-“Go up into Gilead, and take balm, О virgin, the daughter\nof Egypt.” This is shown to be /rony by the words that follow: “In vain\nshalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.”\n\nJer. 51:8.-“Howl for her (Babylon); take balm for her pain, if 5ο be she\nmay be healed.” But the context shows that it was destruction, and not\nhealing, that awaited her. So verse 11.\n\nLam. 4:21.-“Rejoice and be glad, О daughter of Edom,” etc. This is\nIrony; for judgment is announced in verse 22. The meaning simply is,\nthat, however much Edom might rejoice, the punishment of her iniquity\nshould be accomplished.\nEze. 3:24.-“Go, shut thyself within thine house.” But the 25th verse\nshows that however closely he might shut himself up his enemies\nshould find him and bind him.\nEze. 20:39.-“As for you, О house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God;\nGo ye, serve ye every one his idols,” etc.\n\nIt is impossible that Adonai Jehovah should command idolatry. It is\nIrony, as is clear from the context.\nEze. 28:3.-“Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that\nthey can hide from thee.”\n\nGod thus ironically addresses the king of Tyre. Daniel, on account\nof Divine gifts, was esteemed most wise. But the king of Tyre was a\nmere man, as verse 2 declares.\nAmo. 4:4-5.-“Come to Bethel and transgress; at Gilgal multiply\ntransgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes\nafter three years: And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and\nproclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you (i.e., you\nlove to do this), O ye children of Israel.”\n\nThat this is Irony and sarcasm is clear from the conclusion of the\naddress in verse 12. Deu. 14:28 and Lev. 7:13 are the passages\nreferred to.\n\nNah. 3:14.-“Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strongholds”:\netc.: {Θ., prepare as you will, but all your labour will be in vain. (See\nunder Heterosis).\n\nZec. 11:13.-“A goodly price.”\n\nThe word “goodly” is used by Antiphrasis, to denote the opposite.\nMal. 1:9.-“And now, | pray you, beseech God (ΕΙ) that he will be\ngracious unto us.”\n\nThese words are put by God in the mouth of the priests, and His\n\nanswer is given in what follows.\nMar. 7:9.-Here the /rony is beautifully brought out by translating καλῶς\n(kal6s) “full well.” καλῶς means with propriety, suitably, becomingly. №\nsuited the people to set aside the commandment of God, and make\nvoid the Word of God by their tradition. This exactly suited and\ncorresponded to the action of those who washed the outside but were\ndefiled within.\n\nSee the whole context, which applies with force, to-day, to all mere\nphilanthropists and reformers, who preach a “social” Gospel, in order\nto raise the ungodly in the social scale, but leave the masses short of\nthat which God requires.\n“Well do ye reject.” No, ye do evil!\nLuk. 11:41.-“But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and,\nbehold, all things are clean unto you.” It is /rony. It was what the\nPharisees taught, but it was not true.\n\nLuk. 13:33.-“I must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the day following:\nfor it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.”\n\nThis is a message to Herod, whom He calls (by Hypocatastasis)\n“that fox” (or that vixen), and the last words are Ironical, as is clear\nfrom the solemn exclamation which follows in the next verse.\n\nThe sense of the whole passage seems to be:-We are still three\ndays’ walk from Jerusalem. To Jerusalem | must get: to die there: for\nJerusalem is become the natural place for prophets to perish in. So\nyou need not threaten me with death from Herod. It is not within his\njurisdiction-(see 23:7: “As soon as he knew that He belonged to\nHerod\'s jurisdiction”)-that | must die.\n\nJoh. 3:10.-“Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?”\nThis is a species of mild /rony.\n\nJoh. 7:28 is Irony, and refers back to verse 27. “Whom ye know not”\npoints to the fact that they knew not God, and, therefore, they knew\nnot Christ.\n1Co. 6:4.-“Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.”\n\nThe next verse shows clearly that this is /rony, and a\ncondemnation of what they had really done. For he asks, “Is it so that\nthere is not a wise man among you? No; not one that shall be able to\njudge between his brethren?”\n2Co. 5:3.-“If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.”\n\nHere, the /rony being missed, the text has been altered in some\nMSS. (περ, as / suppose, for ye, at least). There is no sense unless\nthe Irony is seen. “If indeed being clothed also, we shall not be found\nnaked,” as some of you believe who say “that there is no resurrection\nof the dead” (1Co. 15:12), and therefore no resurrection body for us to\nbe clothed-upon with.\n2Co. 13:5.-“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove\nyour own selves.”\n\nThe Hyperbaton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), by which the pronoun\nἑαυτούς (heautous), yourselves, is placed at the beginning of the\nsentence, (the object before the subject), shows the emphasis which\nis to be placed upon it, and tells us that this is the serious irony of a\ngrieved heart, and not a general command. These Corinthian saints,\nhaving been beguiled by the Jewish enemies of the apostle to\nquestion his apostleship, actually sought a proof of Christ speaking in\nhim! So he meets their questionings with another question: “Since ye\nseek a proof of Christ speaking in me ... YOURSELVES examine ye,\nif ye are in the faith; YOURSELVES prove ye. Know ye not that Jesus\nChrist is in you except ye be reprobates?”\n\nThe answer to this question, thus ironically put, would prove them\nto be the seals of his ministry, and the real proof of his apostleship.\n\nHere is no command for the saints to-day, no admonition to\npractise continual self-examination and introspection, to see whether\nthey are in the faith; for Christ is in them. Read the words in\nconnection with the context, and the force of this solemn /rony will be\nat once seen: and it will be used no more to vex and perplex God’s\ndear children, by taking words which refer to their state to upset their\nstanding, which is perfect and complete “in Christ.”\n\nIl. Human Irony:\nWhere the speaker is a human being\n\n1Sa. 26:15.-The words of David to Abner: “Art thou not a valiant man?\nAnd who is like to thee in Israel?”\n\nThis sarcasm was used to show how Abner had neglected his\nduty.\n1Ki. 18:27.-The words of Elijah to the prophets of Baal were sarcasm\nof the severest kind.\n1Ki. 22:15.-The words of the prophet Micaiah to Ahab and\nJehoshaphat: “Go, and prosper’; to show by /rony the false\nprophecies of Ahab’s own prophets.\n2Ki. 8:10.-The words of Elisha to Hazael: “Go, say unto him (i.e., the\nking of Syria), Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the Lord hath\nshewed me that he shall surely die.”\n\nBy the Irony in the first clause, Elisha stated a fact, that there was\nno reason why Benhadad should not recover. In the latter clause he\nrevealed to Hazael that he knew he meant to murder him, as it came\nto pass. Compare verses 11, 14 and 15.\n\nJob. 12:2.-“No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with\nyou.” This powerful Irony is meant to emphasise the fact that Job’s\nfriends had no more knowledge than he: and may be used with great\ntruth of many who arrogate to themselves the right to sit in judgment\non their sinful fellow-servants.\n\nJob. 26:2-3 -The words of Job to his friend: “How hast thou helped\nhim that is without power,” etc.\n\nMat. 11:19.-“А friend of publicans and sinners.” This was said in /гопу,\nbut it expresses a blessed fact for all Divinely-convicted sinners.\n\nLuk. 15:2.-“This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.” This\nwas said in Irony, but it expresses a most blessed truth for all who\nknow and feel themselves to be sinners.\nJoh. 18:38.-“Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?”\n\nBy his not waiting for the answer it seems that the question wasnot\nseriously put. (See under Erotesis). So, his words in\nJoh. 19:14.-“Behold your king,” were also /rony.\n1Co. 4:8.-This verse is true /rony. But other figures are involved. See\nunder Asyndeton, Anabasis, and Metonymy (of the subject).\n2Co. 10:12.-In the words, “we dare not,” the Apostle intimates, by\nIrony, that he was far beyond those who thought themselves to be\nsomebodies.\n2Co. 11:19.-“Ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.”\n2Co. 12:13.-“Forgive me this wrong.”\n\nIll. Peirastic Irony:\nBy way of trying or testing\n\nThis third kind of /гопу is where the words may not mean exactly what\nthey seem to say, but are used by way of trial to the persons to whom\nthey were spoken, not sarcastically, but peirastically: i.e., by way of\ntrying and testing. The Greeks called this PEIRASTIKOS, πειραστικός,\nfitted for trying and testing; from πειράζω (peirazé), to make proof or\ntrial.\n\nGen. 19:2.-The angels said to Lot, “Nay; but we will abide in the street\nall night.” This was said to try Lot, to see what he would do; for they\nwere not sent to abide in Sodom at all.\n\nGen. 22:2.-God said to Abraham, “Take now thy son, thine only son,\nIsaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and\noffer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which |\nwill tell thee of.” God said this (it distinctly says) to try him (not tempt,\nin our modern use of the word).\n\nVerse 12 farther shows that God never intended that the sacrifice\nshould actually take place. Abraham thought He did, and believed\nthat, if Isaac had been offered, God would have raised him from the\ndead. See Heb. 11:17-19.\n\nIt seems very probable that this was the spot where the altar of\nburnt offering was afterwards erected. Compare 1Ch. 21:26; 1Ch.\n21:28; 1Ch. 22:1, and 2Ch. 3:1.\n\nMat. 15:24.-Jesus said to the disciples what was perfectly true as a\nmatter of fact, and as though to endorse their position, “I was not sent\nexcept to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But it was said by way\nof trial to the woman’s faith.\nSo also in verse 26, when He said to her: “It is not meet to take the\nchildren’s bread (with emphasis on children, by Antimereia, q.v. [Note:\nWhich see.] ), and to cast it to the little dogs,” meaning herself (by\nHypocatastasis, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). See also this verse under\nMeiosis and Synecdoche.\n\nIV. Simulated Irony:\nWhere the words in question are used by man either in\ndissimulation or hypocrisy\n\nGen. 37:19.-Joseph’s brethren said: “Behold this dreamer cometh.”\nThe Heb. is stronger than this, as is partly shown in the margin:\n“Behold that Master of the dreams, there he comes.” They did not\nmean this, for see verses 5 and 11.\n\n2Sa. 6:20.-Michal to David: “How glorious was the king of Israel to-\nday!”\n\nThat this was hypocritical is shown by verse 16: “She despised\nhim in her heart.” And so David understood it (verses 21, 22). Note\nthat the uncovering of which Michal spoke referred only to his royal\nrobes; as is clear from 1Ch. 15:27, which tells us what he was\n“clothed” with.\nPsa. 22:8 (9).-“He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him.”\n\nMost true, but not meant as truth in the lips of His enemies, as is\nclear from Mat. 27:43. See also under Heterosis.\nIsa. 5:19.-These words are used hypocritically, as is clear from the\n“Woe” pronounced on the speakers in verse 18.\nMat. 22:16.-The disciples of the Pharisees, and the Herodians say to\nChrist: “Master, we know that thou art true,” etc.\nMat. 27:29.-“Hail, King of the Jews!” So also verses 40, 42 and 43;\nMar. 15:20, etc.\n\nV. Deceptive Irony:\nWhere words are clearly false as well as hypocritical\n\nGen. 3:4-5.-Words clearly false, for Satan knew the opposite: and Eve\nought to have known the same, as they flatly contradicted the words of\nthe Lord God.\nMat. 2:8.-Herod says to the wise men: “Go and search for the young\nchild; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that | may\ncome and worship him also” (or that | also may come and worship\nhim).\nThis was false, for Herod wanted to slay Him, and not to worship Him.',''),(146,146,'oxymoron','Job. 22:6.-“And stripped the naked of their clothing.”\n\nHere the figure Synecdoche (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) turns the\n\nphrase into a powerful Oxymoron.\nIsa. 58:10.-“Thy darkness shall be as the noon-day.” See under\nAntimetathesis.\nJer. 22:19.-“He shall be buried with the burial of an ass”: i.e., not\nburied at all; he shall have an unburied burial! Compare 2Ch. 36:6,\nand Jer. 36:30; and see under Enallage.\n\nMat. 6:23.-“If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great\nis that darkness.”\n\nHow can light be darkness? The Oxymoron arises from the\nMetonymy by which “light” is put for the human wisdom of the natural\nman, which is darkness (Eph. 4:18).\n\nMat. 16:25.-“Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever\nwill lose his life for my sake shall find it.”\n\nSo Mar. 8:35.\n\nAct. 5:41.-“Rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame\nfor his name.”\n\nThis may sound folly to the natural man, but those who have been\n“made wise” understand it. The two contrary Greek words mark the\nOxymoron more emphatically:-KaTagioGo8ai (kataxiousthai), to be\naccounted very worthy, and ἁτιμασθῆναι (atimastheenai), to be\ntreated as unworthy, or with indignity. (See under Metonymy).\n1Co. 1:25.-“The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the\nweakness of God is stronger than men.”\n\nSee under Parechesis, Metonymy (of Adjunct), and Catachresis.\n1Co. 1:27-29 is a beautiful and elaborate Oxymoron; in order to\nenhance the conclusion “that no flesh should glory in his presence.”\n1Co. 9:17.-“If | do this thing willingly (ἑκών, without wages), | have a\nreward (µισθόν, wages).”\n\nSee under Paronomasia and Meiosis.\n2Co. 6:4; 2Co. 6:8-10.-“Approving ourselves as the ministers of God\n\nAs deceivers, and yet true;\n\nAs unknown, and yet well-known;\n\nAs dying, and, behold, we live;....\n\nAs chastened, and not killed;\n\nAs sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;\n\nAs poor, yet making many rich;\nAs having nothing, and yet possessing all things.”\n2Co. 8:2.-“Their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their\nliberality.”\n\nThis is a most elegant Oxymoron.\n2Co. 12:10.-“When | am weak, then am | strong.”\n\nThis is folly to the natural man, but blessed truth to those who\nknow by experience the true wisdom.\n2Co. 12:11.-“In nothing am | behind the very chiefest apostles, though\n| be nothing.”\nEph. 3:8.-“Less than the least of all saints.” This pleasing Oxymoron\nemphasises the apostle’s growth in grace (i.e., in his knowledge of\nwhat grace was to him, and what it had done for him). Before this, (in\na.d. 60), he said: “I was not behind the very chiefest apostles” (20ο.\n11:5) In a.d. 62, he could say that he was “less than the least of all\nsaints,” while, later than this, (a.d. 67), his knowledge of God’s grace\nmade him see himself as “the chief of sinners” (1Ti. 1:15-16). See\nunder Meiosis.\n1Ti. 5:6.-“She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”\nThis Oxymoron arises from a latent Ploce (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]\n), the word “dead” denoting the absence of spiritual life: “dead in\ntrespasses and sins.”',''),(147,147,'idioma','I. Verbs in General\ni. Idiomatic usages of Verbs\n1. The Hebrews used active verbs to express the agent’s design\nor attempt to do anything, even though the thing was not actually\ndone\nExo. 8:18 (14).-“And the magicians did so ({6., attempted to do so)\n\nwith their enchantments, to bring forth lice, but they could not.”\nDeu. 28:68.-“Ye shall be sold (i.e., put up for sale) unto your enemies\n„.. and no man shall buy you.”\nEze. 24:13.-“Because | have purged thee (i.e., used the means to\npurge, by instructions, reproofs and ordinances, etc.), and thou wast\nnot purged.”\n\nWe have the same usage in the New Testament.\nMat. 17:11.-“Elijah truly cometh first, and restoreth all things”: {6.,\nshall begin to restore or design or attempt to do so, for Christ will be\nthe real Restorer of all things. The contrast here, however, is between\nElijah and John, as brought out by the μὲν and the δέ. “Elijah, indeed\n(μὲν, in one respect) cometh, and will restore all things, but (δέ, in\nanother respect) | say unto you that Elijah is come already,” etc.\nGal. 5:4.-“Whosoever of you are justified (i.e., seek to be justified) by\nthe law; ye are fallen from grace”: for chap. 3:11 distinctly declares\nthat “no man is justified by the law in the sight of God.”\nPhp. 3:15.-“As many as be ({6., would be, or try to be) perfect.”\n1Jn. 1:10.-“We make him (i.e., we attempt so far as in us lies to make\nhim) a liar.” (See also chapter 5:10).\n1Jn. 2:26.-“These things have | written unto you concerning them that\nseduce (or deceive) you”: i.e., that would, or that try to, deceive you.\n\n2. Active Verbs are sometimes used to denote the effect of the\n\naction expressed\n\nIsa. 65:1.-“I am sought of them that asked not for me”: i.e., | am found\nof them that sought me not, as in Rom. 10:20.\nJoh. 16:5.-“None of you asketh me whither goest thou”: i.e., none of\nyou knoweth or hath discovered; for Peter had asked that question in\n13:36. Lit., None is enquiring.\n\n3. Active Verbs are used to declare that the thing has been or\nshall be done, and not the actual doing of the thing said to be\ndone\nThe Priest is said to cleanse or pollute according as he declares that\nthe thing is clean or polluted. See Lev. 13:6; Lev. 13:8; Lev. 13:11; Lev.\n13:13; Lev. 13:17; Lev. 13:20, αἵο., where it is actually translated\n\n“pronounce.” See under Metonymy (of the subject) and Synecdoche.\nAct. 10:15.-“What God hath cleansed (i.e., declared to be clean) do\nnot thou pollute (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] “call common’).”\n\nIsa. 6:10.-“Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears\nheavy,” i.e., declare, or foretell that the heart of this people will be fat,\netc. (See Metonymy). In Mat. 13:15, this idiomatic use of the verb is\nnot literally translated, but is idiomatically rendered “the heart of this\npeople is waxed gross.” So in Act. 28:27. While, in Joh. 12:40, it is\nrendered literally according to the Hebrew idiom: “He hath blinded,”\netc.; but who hath done so is not said.\n\nJer. 1:10.-“I have this day set thee over the nations and over the\n\nkingdoms, to root out, and to pull down,” etc.: ie., to declare or\n\nprophesy concerning the nations that they shall be rooted out, etc.\nThe Anglo-Israelites, wrongly taking this literally, declare that Great\n\nBritain is now literally fulfilling this prophecy!\n\nEze. 43:3.-“According to the vision that | saw when | came to destroy\n\nthe city,” etc.: ie., when | came to prophesy or declare that it should\n\nbe destroyed.\n\nEze. 22:2.-“Son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of\n\nbloods (i.e., of great bloodshedding)?” This is explained in the words\n\nthat follow: “Yea, thou shalt shew her (Heb., make her know) all her\n\nabominations.” See under Heterosis.\n\n4. Active verbs were used by the Hebrews to express, not the\ndoing of the thing, but the permission of the thing which the\nagent is said to do. Thus:\n\nGen. 31:7.-Jacob says to Laban: “God did not give him to do me evil”:\nie., as in AV. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\n\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] , God suffered him not, etc.\nExo. 4:21.-“I will harden his heart (i.e., | will permit or suffer his heart\nto be hardened), that he shall not let the people go.” So in all the\npassages which speak of the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart. As is clear\nfrom the common use of the same /diom in the following passages.\nExo. 5:22.-“Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people?”\nie., suffered them to be so evil entreated.\n\nPsa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not give thine Holy One (i.e., suffer Him) to see\ncorruption.” So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.]\n\nJer. 4:10.-“Lord God, surely thou hast greatly deceived this people”:\ni.e., thou hast suffered this People to be greatly deceived, by the false\nprophets, saying: Ye shall have peace, etc.\n\nEze. 14:9.-“If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, |\nthe Lord have deceived that prophet”: {6., | have permitted him to\ndeceive himself.\n\nEze. 20:25.-“Wherefore | gave them also statutes that were not good”:\ni.e., | permitted them to follow the wicked statutes of the surrounding\nnations, mentioned and forbidden in Lev. 18:3.\n\nMat. 6:13.-“Lead us not (i.e., suffer us not to be led) into temptation.”\nMat. 11:25.-“l thank thee, О Father ... because thou hast hid (i.e., not\nrevealed) these things,” etc.\nMat. 13:11.-“It is given to know unto you,” etc. (i.e., ye are permitted to\nknow ... but they are not permitted to know them.\n\nAct. 13:29.-“When they (i.e., the rulers, verse 27) had fulfilled all that\nwas written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him т а\nsepulchre”: i.e., they permitted Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus\nto do so.\n\nRom. 9:18.-“Whom he will he hardeneth”: i.e., he suffereth to be\nhardened. Not that this in any way weakens the absolute sovereignty\nof God.\n\nRom. 11:7.-“The rest were hardened”: i.e., were suffered to become\nblind (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).\n\nRom. 11:8.-“God hath given them the spirit of slumber”: i.e., hath\nsuffered them to fall asleep.\n\n2Th. 2:11.-“For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that\nthey should believe a lie”: i.e., God will leave them and suffer them to\nbe deceived by the great Lie which will come on all the world.\n\n5. Active verbs are used to express, not the doing of a thing, but\nthe occasion of a thing’s being done\nGen. 42:38.-“If mischief befall him by the way ... then shall ye bring\ndown (i.e., ye shall be the occasion of bringing down) my gray hairs,”\netc.\n1Ki. 14:16.-Jeroboam “made Israel to sin”: ie., was the cause of\nIsrael\'s sin by setting up the two calves in Bethel and Dan.\nAct. 1:18.-“This man purchased a field” (i.e., caused the field to be\npurchased), as is plain from Mat. 27:7.\n\n6. Two imperatives are sometimes united, so that the first\nexpresses a condition or limitation in regard to the second; by\nwhich the latter becomes a future\nThis idiom was also used by the Latins “Divide et impera,” not divide\n\nand govern, but divide and thou wilt govern.\n\nJoh. 7:52.-“Search and look”: {6., search and thou wilt see.\n\n1Со. 15:34,-“Awake to righteousness, and sin not”: i.e., and then ye\nwill not sin.\n\n1Ti. 6:12.-“Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life”: {6.,\nthou shalt lay hold of, etc.\nSometimes the future is used literally instead of the idiomatic\nsecond imperative. See Joh. 2:19. Jam. 4:7. In Eph. 5:14, we have\ntwo imperatives and then the future.\n\nii. Special idiomatic usages of Nouns and Verbs\n(1) Noun (in regimen) for Adjective. See under Heterosis.\n\n(2) Noun (a second) for Adjective. See Hendiadys.\n\n(3) Plural Nouns for emphatic singular. See Heterosis.\n\n(4) Certain Adjectives or Nouns used in the New Testament,\naccording to Hebrew idiom, in a sense peculiar to themselves:-\n\n“Able,” when applied to God or Christ, denotes both willingness\nand ability. Rom. 4:21; Rom. 11:23; Rom. 14:4; Rom. 16:25. Heb.\n2:18.\n\n“All” often denotes the greater part. 1Co. 8:1, for see verse 17.\n1Co. 11:2.\n\n“All” often means the greatest degree or quality of that to which it\nis applied. 1Co. 13:2. 2Ti. 1:15. Jam. 1:2.\n“All” signifies some of every kind. Mat. 4:23. Act. 10:12. See\nfurther for the usage of the word “all,” under Metonymy and\nSynecdoche.\n\n“A blessing’ signifies a gift.\n\nGen. 33:11.-Jacob says to Esau: “Take, | pray thee, my blessing ({6.,\nmy gift and present) that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt\ngraciously with me, and because | have enough (Heb., all things). And\nhe urged him, and he took it”: {6., everything.\n\n1Sa. 25:27.-“This blessing (i.e., gift; margin, present) which thine\nhandmaid hath brought.”\n\nRom. 15:29.-“I shall come in the fulness of the blessing (i.e., the gift)\nof the Gospel of Christ.”\n2Co. 9:5.-“That they would go before unto you, and make up\nbeforehand your blessing”: i.e., your gift to the saints (see A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nmarg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).\n\n“Doctrine” (διδαχή, didachee) means the thing taught; but it is\nused idiomatically and by Metonymy (α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), for the\ndiscourse in which it is taught.\n\nThis is because it denotes more than διδασκαλία (didaskalia), for it\nhas to do with the style of teaching; the manner as well as the thing\ntaught. See, e.g., Mat. 7:28-29.\nMar. 4:2.-“He taught them many things by parables, and said unto\nthem in his doctrine”: i.e., his teaching or discourse. So chap. 11:18;\n12:38.\nAct. 2:42.-“And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine”:\nie., they regularly attended at the teaching of the apostles: i.e., when\nthey taught.\n1Co. 14:26.-“Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, etc.”:\ni.e., a discourse to give.\n\n“To eat or drink.”-As the Hebrews used the nouns meat and drink\nof knowledge (by Metonymy, α.ν. [Note: Which see] ), so they\nnaturally used the verbs eating and drinking to denote the operation of\nthe mind in receiving, understanding, and applying doctrine or\ninstruction of any kind, as we speak of “digesting” what is said, or of\n“inwardly digesting’ it.\n\nIt thus marks a very intimate and real partaking of the benefits of\nthat which we receive through our minds.\n\nJer. 15:16.-“Thy words were found, and | did eat them.” The rest of\nthe verse explains the figure.\n\nEze. 3:1.-“Son of man ... eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of\nIsrael”: i.e., consider it, and get the contents of this roll by heart, and\nthen go and speak it to the house of Israel, as is clear from verse 4:\n“Speak with my words unto them.”\n\nJoh. 6:51.-“I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if\nany man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever”: i.e., just as the body\nlives temporally by eating bread, so the new life is nourished by\nfeeding upon Christ in our hearts by faith.\n\nSo, verse 53: “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink\nhis blood, ye have no life in you”: {6., except you feed on Christ in\nyour hearts and partake of His life (for the blood is the life), ye have no\nlife in you. That this cannot refer to the Lord’s supper is clear from the\nfact that it was not then instituted, and the words could not have been\nunderstood (as they were); and, further, that it would shut out all who,\nfrom age and infirmity or other cause, had not partaken of that supper.\n\nIt cannot refer to the Mass, as there is no drinking at all in the\nMass.\n\nBy comparing verses 47 and 40 with verses 53 and 54, it will be\nseen that believing on Christ is exactly the same thing as eating and\ndrinking of His flesh and blood.\n1Co. 12:13.-“And have been all made to drink into one spirit”: i.e.,\nreceive. Compare Luk. 13:15.\n\n“Not to be” is a Hebraism for to be abject and vile, to be nothing\n(10ο. 1:28); while on the other hand,\n\n“To be” means to be in high esteem, or of great value (1Co. 1:28).\nGod hath chosen “things which are not, to bring to nought things that\nare.” So also\n2Sa. 19:6 (9).-“Thou regardest neither princes nor servants.” Here, the\nfigure is translated; for the Heb. is (as in the margin: “that princes and\nservants are not to thee.”) R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :\n“Are nought unto thee.”\n“To permit.” Heb. 6:3 : “This will we do, if God permit”: i.e., if God\nso orders it, and gives the needed grace and strength.\n“To seek.” Mat. 6:32 : “After all these things do the Gentiles seek”:\nie., they put them in the first place, and are over-anxious, with\nexcessive solicitude. So Luk. 12:30.\n\n“To salute.” Act. 18:22 : “And when he had ... gone up, and\nsaluted the church”: i.e., and had held familiar intercourse with them.\nCompare 20:1. See also 21:7, 19; 25:13. This is shown from the\nopposite; 2Ki. 4:29 : “Salute him not”: {6., do not stop to talk with him.\nSo Luk. 10:4.\n\n“To touch’ for to hurt or to do any harm to. Gen. 26:29. Rth. 2:9.\nJob. 1:11; Job. 2:5; Job. 19:21. Psa. 105:15. Jer. 12:14. Eze. 17:10.\nZec. 2:8. Heb. 11:28. 1Jn. 5:18.\n\nAlso, “to touch” is used for cohabitation. Gen. 20:6. Pro. 6:29. 1Co.\nτι.\n\nAlso, for detention, or for diverting from any purpose. Joh. 20:17.\n\n“To come”: where the simple verb is used for all that pertains to\nChrist\'s advent. Mat. 11:3. 1Jn. 4:2-3; 1Jn. 5:6.\n\n“To see another’ is used for making war with him, or of meeting\nhim in battle. 2Ki. 14:8; 2Ki. 14:11; 2Ki. 23:29, etc.\n“To build” is used for restore anything to all its former glory. Eze.\n26:14.\n\n“To walk” is used for proceeding happily and prosperously. Hos.\n14:9.\n\n“To hear” is used of understanding and obeying. Joh. 8:47. Luk.\n8:15.\n\n“To confess’ is used of abiding in the faith, and walking according\nto truth. 1Jn. 4:15. Rom. 10:9-10. So also Mat. 10:32.\n\n“Able to say” is used of being able really and truly to affirm from\nthe heart. Pro. 20:9.\n1Co. 12:3.-“No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy\nGhost.” Any one can utter the words; but no one can truly, with the\nwhole heart, own Jesus as his Lord, and take Him for his Master, but\nby the Holy Ghost.\n\n“To eat and drink” is a Hebraism used not merely for chewing\nfood or swallowing any liquid, but for good living and drinking wine;\nMat. 11:18-19 with Luk. 7:33-34 and Pro. 31:4.\n\n“To do” for to bring to pass, do a very great deal, do all. So it is\ntranslated in Psa. 37:5. Dan. 9:19.\n\n“To do (i.e., commit) sin” means to sin wilfully and willingly. 1Jn.\n3:9. See 1:8, 10; 5:18. Joh. 8:34.\n\n“To do justice or righteousness” is used for willingly, earnestly\nand joyfully walking and living as one whom God has justified. 1Jn.\n3:7.\n\n“To work’ is used of seeking to gain salvation by human merit.\nRom. 4:4-5, as opposed to grace (chap. 11:6).\n\n“To give account” means not simply to render a mere account,\nbut to suffer all the consequences of unrighteousness. 1Pe. 4:5. Mat.\n12:36.\n\n“To will” is used for to wish to do anything speedily and\nspontaneously. 2Co. 8:11. The figure is well translated “to be forward”\n(verse 10)-as being greater even than the actual doing.\n\nAlso for eager desire (Mar. 10:35; Mar. 12:38), where the figure is\nwell translated “which love to go in long clothing,” etc. Gal. 4:21,\nwhere it is well rendered “desire.” “Tell me, ye that desire (love) to be\nunder the law.” So it ought to be rendered in 1Ti. 6:9 : “They that will to\nbe rich”: i.e., love to be rich.\n“To look” or “to see” is often used (a) implying the delight or\npleasure felt by the beholder (whether it be sinful or innocent): Psa.\n22:17 (18); 35:21; 59:10 (11). (b) Sometimes also as implying sorrow\nand grief: Gen. 21:16; Gen. 44:34. Joh. 19:37 (compare Zec.\n12:10-14. Rev. 1:7). (ο) And sometimes implying attention and\nprovision: 2Ki. 10:3. Mat. 7:5. 1Co. 10:12 (where the figure is well\ntranslated “take heed,” as it is also in Col. 4:17).\n“To live” is used not merely of being alive, or having life, but of\nhaving all that makes life worth living, flourishing and prospering. 1Sa.\n10:24, where the figure is rendered “God save,” “God save the king.”\nThe Heb. is “Let the king live.” So also 1Ki. 1:25. In 1Sa. 25:6, it is\nrendered “That liveth in prosperity.” Psa. 22:26 (27); 69:32 (33). Ecc.\n6:8. 1Th. 3:8. (The opposite of this is 1Sa. 25:37 : “his heart died\nwithin him’).\n\nThe word “life” has also the same usage, Psa. 34:12 (13). 1Pe.\n3:10, as it has also in our English idiom.\n\n“To hear.” The verb ἀκούειν (akouein), to hear, is used\nidiomatically when followed by the accusative case. It then means, not\nonly to hear the voice of the person speaking (which is indicated by\nthe genitive case following), but to understand, to receive, to believe,\netc., what is said, having regard, not to the speaker, but to the subject-\nmatter.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between Act. 9:7 and Act. 22:9 is\nexplained by this idiomatic use of ἀκούειν (akouein). In the former\npassage it is followed by the genitive case, and means that they heard\nthe sound of the voice; while in the latter passage, it is followed by the\naccusative case, and means that they did not hear the subject-matter:\nie., they heard the sound of the voice, but did not understand what\nwas said.\n\nJoh. 8:43.-“Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye\ncannot hear (i.e., receive) my word.”\n\nJoh. 9:27.-“I have told you already, and ye did not hear ({6., believe).\nWhy again do ye desire to hear?” In the latter clause it is used in its\nordinary sense; in the former idiomatically.\n\n1Со. 14:2.-“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not to\nmen, but to God, for no one heareth ({6., understandeth) him.” The\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] so renders it, and puts “heareth” in the margin.\n\nGal. 4:21.-“Ye, that desire to be under law, do ye not hear (i.e.,\nunderstand) the Law?”\n\n1Со. 5:1.-“It is commonly heard ({6., understood) that there is\nfornication among you.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has “reported.”\n\n“Hearing” акой (akoee) is used, not merely of the act of hearing,\nbut of what is heard: a narration, report, fame. This is a kind of\nMetonymy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).\n\nMat. 14:1.-“Herod the tetrarch heard the hearing (i.e., the fame) of\nJesus.”\nJoh. 12:38.-“Who hath believed our hearing?” (/.e., our report).\n\n“Called.” To be called is used of being acknowledged, accounted,\nor simply of being.\n1Jn. 3:1.-“That we should be called the sons of God.”\n\n“Holy” means primarily that which is ceremonially clean and free\nfrom defilement.\n\nDeu. 23:14.-“Therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean\nthing.”\n\nHence it means separated from a common to a sacred or special\nuse. For places and inanimate things can clearly be holy only in this\nspecial sense, and not as regards intrinsic moral purity.\n\nThe word Holy in Hebrew sometimes means bountiful, merciful,\nbeneficent. And so may have the same meaning in some passages of\nthe New Testament. See Tit. 1:8. Heb. 7:26, etc.\n\n“Honour” has a wide range of meaning in Hebrew, and is used of\nnourishment, maintenance.\n\nMat. 15:6.-“And shall not honour (i.e., support) his father or his\nmother.”\n1Со. 12:26.-“Or one member be honoured (i.e., nourished) all the\nmembers rejoice with it.”\n\n1Ti. 5:3.-“Honour widows that are really widows,”: [.Θ., maintain them\nout of the funds of the church, as is clear from verse 4.\n1Ti. 5:17.-“Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double\nhonour’: i.e., of a liberal (see Metonymy) maintenance.”\n\n1Pe. 3:7.-“Giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel”:\ni.e., nourishing and supporting her, etc.\n\n“Hand.” For various idiomatic phrases in connection with the word\n“hand,” see under Metonymy.\n\n“Living” was used by the Hebrews to express the excellency of\nthe thing to which it is applied. In some cases the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has\n“lively.”\n\nJoh. 4:10-11.-“Living water.”\nAct. 7:38.-“Living oracles.”\nHeb. 10:20.-“Living way.”\n1Pe. 2:4-5.-“Living stones.”\nRev. 7:17.-“Living fountains.”\n\n“Riches” denotes not merely money, but an abundance of that to\nwhich it is applied; as our English word “wealth” is used of things other\nthan money.\nRom. 2:4.-“Or despisest thou the riches (i.e., the greatness) of his\ngoodness?” {6., His abounding goodness, or wealth of goodness.\nEph. 1:7.-“According to the riches (i.e., the great abundance or\nwealth) of his grace.”\n\nEph. 3:8.-“The unsearchable (or the untrackable) riches (i.e., wealth\nor greatness) of Christ.” This greatness consisting of all God’s\npurposes in Christ as set forth in this epistle; which the Old Testament\nsaints could not trace out or understand. See 1Pe. 1:10-11.\n\nCol. 1:27.-“What is the riches ({6., the great abundance) of the glory\nof this Mystery.”\n\nCol. 2:2.-“All riches of the full assurance of understanding”: i.e., the\nabundant or fullest assurance of knowledge.\n\n“To sanctify” often means to make ceremonially clean: i.e., to\ncleanse a thing from those defilements which made it unfit for sacred\nuses. Hence, it means simply to set apart, fit, or prepare for a\nparticular purpose.\n\nJer. 12:3.-“Sanctify (i.e., prepare) them for the day of slaughter.”\n1Co. 7:14.-“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and\nthe unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband”: each (though one\nbe an unbeliever) is fitted to perform the respective duties as husband\nand wife. So with the children, “now are they holy”: i.e., they were to\nbe no longer reckoned as idolators, but were separated from heathen\nassociations, and ceremonially free from such defilement. See under\n“holy” above.\n\nHow can we “sanctify God,” as in Isa. 8:13. Mat. 6:9. 1Ре. 3:15,\nexcept by setting Him high above and apart from every other object of\nrespect and veneration?\n\n“Spirit? was used in various combinations by the Hebrews to\ndenote the greatest degree of any mental quality. As we speak of the\nspirit or essence of any person or thing!\n\nLuk. 10:21.-“Jesus rejoiced in spirit”: .e., exceedingly.\n\nAct. 18:25.-“Being fervent in spirit” means exceedingly zealous. So\nRom. 12:11.\n\nAct. 19:21.-“Paul purposed in spirit”: /.e., firmly resolved.\n\nAct. 20:22.-“Behold, | go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem”: i.e., with\na fixed determination and settled purpose.\n\nRom. 1:9.-“Whom | serve with my spirit’: ie., with the most fervent\nzeal.\n“Walk” is used of one’s continued course of action and life: i.e., the\nhabitual habit and manner of life.\n\nGen. 5:22; Gen. 5:24.-“Enoch walked with God.”\nRom. 8:1.-“Who walk not after the flesh,” etc.\n2Co. 5:7.-“We walk by faith, not by sight.”\n\n“Word” (λόγος, Jogos) in the New Testament follows the Hebrew\nidiom; and signifies not merely a word, but speech, which is the\noutcome of words. Hence, it is used of any matter, thing, or affair of\nany kind.\n\nLuk. 1:2.-“Were eye witnesses and ministers of the Word”: i.e., the\nLiving Word, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAct. 6:2.-“It is not reason that we should leave the word of God (ie.,\nthe preaching and ministry of the Gospel), and serve tables.”\nAct. 10:44.-“The Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word”: {6., the\nGospel which Peter preached.\nMat. 21:24.-“I also shall ask you one word”: i.e., one thing, or a\nquestion as to one matter.\nAct. 10:29.-Ч ask therefore for what word (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , for\nwhat intent) ye have sent for me.”\nAct. 19:38.-“Have a word.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has a matter; but according to\nthe Heb. idiom, an accusation.\n1Co. 15:2.-“If ye keep in memory by what word | preached unto you”:\ni.e., what was the subject-matter of my preaching.\n\nThus the word must take its colouring from the context. In Exo.\n34:28, it means the ten commandments. So in Rom. 13:9.\n\nIn 1Co. 14:19, it means sentences.\n\nThe word “son” was used, not only by Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:\nWhich зее.] ), but idiomatically, and not according to Greek usage.\n\n“A son of death” (1Sa. 20:31) means devoted to death, and is\nrendered in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] : “he shall surely die.” So Psa. 102:20 (21).\n\nThis idiom means that the persons thus spoken of belong very\nemphatically to that which they are thus said to be “sons of.”\n\n“Sons of the bride-chamber.” Mat. 9:15. Luk. 5:34.\n\nA “son of hell.” Mat. 23:15.\n\n“Sons of the wicked one.” Mat. 13:38.\n\n“Son of the devil.” Act. 13:10.\n\n“Sons of disobedience.” This is very much stronger than the mere\ntame expression disobedient children. It means that they pertain to\nand belong to Satan in a special manner; are those in whom he works\n(Eph. 2:2), and on whom the wrath of God comes (Eph. 5:6). It does\nnot say that God’s children were such, but only that we had our\nconversation “among” them. We were, by nature, “sons of wrath”\n(Eph. 2:3): ᾖ9., those deserving of God\'s wrath; but, through His grace\nanother has borne that wrath, as verses 4-7 goes on to say.\n“The son of perdition” (2Th. 2:3. Joh. 17:12) is one who is lost in a\nvery emphatic and terrible sense.\n\nSee under Synecdoche.\n\niii. Idiomatic Degrees of Comparison\nIn the Hebrew there are several idiomatic ways of emphasizing\nadjectives, and making them superlative.\n1. Preposition after Adjective\n\nBy the use of the preposition “in” or “among” after a simple adjective,\nas Pro. 30:30, “a lion, strong among beasts”: i.e., the strongest of\nbeasts.\n\nThe New Testament has the same /diom.\nLuk. 1:42.-“Blessed art thou among women”: i.e., the most blessed of\nwomen.\n2. Noun (in regimen) for Adjective\nBy using a noun (by Enallage) instead of an adjective, and putting it in\nregimen: as “angels of might,” which is stronger than simply using the\nordinary adjective “mighty.” “Kingdom of Heaven”: i.e., God’s kingdom,\nas greater and better than all kingdoms which are “of” (ek) this world.\nSee for examples under Enallage.\n\n3. Noun repeated in Genitive Plural\nBy repeating the same noun in the genitive plural, as “Heaven of\nheavens”: {6., the highest heaven. See under Polyptoton.\n\n4. “Of God” as Adjective\n\nBy using the words “of God” instead of an adjective, e.g.,\n1Sa. 14:15.-“Tremblings of God”: i.e., great or very mighty tremblings,\nmeaning an earthquake.\nPsa. 36:6 (7)-“Mountains of God”: ie., the loftiest or grandest\nmountains. See under Enallage.\n5. Duplication of Noun as Adjective\nBy the repetition of the same word, as “peace, peace”: {6., perfect\npeace. So\nMat. 23:7 : “Rabbi, Rabbi”: i.e., most excellent Rabbi.\nMat. 7:21.-“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord”: i.e., most\ngracious Lord.\nMar. 14:45.-“Master, master”: i.e., most excellent Master. See further\nunder Epizeuxis.\n6. Two Nouns conjoined\n\nBy using a noun instead of an adjective, not in regimen, but (by\nHendiadys) in the same case and number, and joined to the other\nnoun by a conjunction.\n2Sa. 20:19.-“A city and a mother’: i.e., a metropolitan city.\nAct. 14:13.-“Oxen and garlands”: {Θ., oxen-yes, and garlanded oxen\ntoo. See under Hendiadys.\n\n7. Plural Noun for Singular Adjective\nBy using the plural instead of the singular.\nPsa. 51:17 (19).-“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,” etc.: i.e.,\nthe great sacrifice which God requires is a broken spirit and a contrite\nheart. See under Heterosis.\n\n8. Verb and Cognate Noun\nEven a verb can be exalted to a superlative degree, as well as an\nadjective, by using with it a cognate noun: e.g.,\nLuk. 22:15.-“With desire | have desired”: {6., | have greatly desired.\nAct. 4:17.-“Let us threaten them with a threat”: i.e., let us threaten\nthem very severely.\nAct. 5:28.-“Did we not charge you with a charge”: i.e., did we not\nstraitly charge you. See under Polyptoton.\n\n9. Verb and its Participle\nA verb can also be emphasized superlatively by combining with it its\nparticiple: e.g., “Seeing | have seen”: {6., | have surely seen. “Dying\nthou wilt die”: i.e., thou wilt surely die. See under Polyptoton.\niv. Idiomatic Use of Prepositions\nPrepositions are used in the New Testament not according to the\nGreek idiom, but to the Hebrew. The Greeks had many prepositions,\nbut the Hebrews had very few. Consequently, used according to the\nHebrew Idiom, the manifold relations cannot be expressed with great\ndefiniteness.\n\nThe few Hebrew prepositions are used in the Old Testament with\nvarious meanings which can be easily gathered from the context. For\nexample, the Hebrew ? (beth) means primarily in; but it also\nfrequently means by (with reference to the instrument used), or\namong; or at, or near; also upon, and with. Now the Greeks have, and\nwould have used, a different preposition for each of these.\n\nIt is a great mistake, therefore, always to translate ἐν (en), in, as is\ntoo frequently done in the New Testament. It must be taken with all the\nshades and breadth of meaning which the Hebrew beth (2) has.\nWhen the Greek of the New Testament is put into Hebrew, this fact is\nat once clearly seen.\n\nFor example:-\n\nMat. 3:11.-John said, “I indeed baptize you with water.”\nMat. 7:2.-“With what judgment ye judge ... with what measure ye\nmeet.”\nMat. 7:6.-“Lest they trample them with (A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ under) their feet.”\nMar. 3:22.-“By the prince of the devils.”\nLuk. 11:20.-“With the finger of God.”\nLuk. 22:49.-“Shall we smite with the sword.”\nRev. 1:5.-“Washed us from our sins by (or through) his own blood,”\nnot “in,” as A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nrenders this “by,” and puts in the margin, “Greek, in.”\nRev. 5:9.-Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text\nof our English Bible, 1611.] renders it properly “by.”\n\nv. Idiomatic Use of Numerals\n1. According to the Hebrew idiom, the numeral cic (heis), one, is\n\nused instead of the ordinary pronoun\n\nMat. 8:19.-“One scribe said to him”: i.e., one of the scribes, or a\ncertain particular scribe.\nSee also 9:18; 16:14; 18:24, 28; 21:19; 26:69. Mar. 10:17; Mar.\n12:42. Luk. 5:12; Luk. 5:17. Joh. 6:9; Joh. 7:21; Joh. 20:7. Rev. 8:13,\netc.\n\n2. Sometimes, following the Hebrew idiom, the negative is joined\nwith the verb instead of with the predicate: e.g.\n\nMat. 10:29.-“One of them shall not fall.” The ordinary Greek idiom\n\nwould be, “not one (οὐδείς) of them shall fall.” Luk. 12:6.\n\n3. The adjective ac (pas), every or all is frequently so used\nThe Hebrews would say everything is not, and this is put instead of\nthe ordinary Greek idiom, nothing is.\n\nPsa. 103:2.-“Forget not all his benefits”: i.e., forget not any.\nLuk. 1:37.-“Every thing will not be impossible with God”: i.e., nothing\nis impossible.\n\nSo Mat. 24:22. Mar. 13:20. Joh. 3:15-16; Joh. 6:39; Joh. 12:46.\nRom. 3:20. 1Со. 1:29. Gal. 2:16. 1Jn. 2:21. Rev. 18:22.\n4. In Hebrew the numeral is doubled to express distribution\nWe find this in the New Testament, instead of the Greek idiom which\nexpresses it by the preposition avd (ana). We find the Hebrew idiom,\ne.g., in Mar. 6:7, “He sent them two two” (i.e., two and two together):\nie., in pairs. Compare the Greek idiom in Luk. 10:1.\n\nThis idiom is not confined to numerals, for we find it with other\nnouns: 6.0.,\n\nMar. 6:39, by companies (so Exo. 8:14 (10), LXX [Note: XX The\nSeptuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ).\n\nIn Mar. 6:40, both the Hebrew and Greek idioms are used.\n\nCompare Luk. 9:14. 2Co. 4:16.\n\nvi. Idiomatic forms of Quotations\nIn quotations the Hebrews generally omitted the word “saying,”\nwhenever the words of another speaker were quoted. They very\nfrequently stand alone without the verb “saying.” Hence it is often\nsupplied by italics. See Psa. 2:2, but sometimes even italics are\nomitted, and the passage is most obscure.\nPsa. 109:1-31 -“Saying” should be added in italics at the end of verse\n5; all the words down to the end of verse 19 being the words of\nDavid\'s adversaries which they spake against David. See this\npassage under Ellipsis (page 33).\nPsa. 144:12 should begin with the word “saying”; verses 12 to the\nmiddle of verse 15 being the “vanity” and the “falsehood” which the\n“strange children” spake (verses 8, 11).\n\nSee this passage also under Ellipsis (page 33).\n\nFrom this usage another idiom followed, in the asking of a\nquestion.\n\nvii. Idiomatic Forms of Question\n\nIn Hebrew a question often begins with “if: ie., “if this be done”\nmeans “tell me whether this is done.” But the Greeks never used the\n“if in this sense in order to ask a question. In Greek it always\nexpresses a condition. Yet, following the Hebrew idiom, we have:\nLuk. 22:49.-“/f we shall smite with sword”: {.6., shall we smite, etc.\nviii. Idiomatic Phrases\n1. “Answered and said” was used by Hebrew idiom of whatever kind\nof speech is in question\nIt should therefore not be rendered literally, “Answered and said,” but\ntranslated so as to express whatever may be the particular kind of\nspeech referred to in the verb “said”; e.g.:\nMat. 11:25.-“At that time Jesus answered and said, | thank thee, O\nFather,” etc.\nThis should be, “At that time Jesus prayed and said,” etc.\nMar. 12:25.-“At that time Jesus answered and said, while he taught in\nthe temple, How say the scribes that Christ, etc.”\nHere it should be “Asked and said.” So Mar. 13:2, etc.\nMar. 11:14.-“And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of\nthee hereafter for ever.”\nIt is clear that this cannot be literally meant, for the tree had said\nnothing. It should be “Jesus addressed the tree, and said to it.”\n2. My soul, your soul, their souls, is the Hebrew idiom for myself,\nyourself, yourselves, etc.\nSee Num. 23:10. Jdg. 16:30. Psa. 59:3 (4); 35:13; 103:1; 121:7, Jer.\n18:20 (cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] 38:16).\n\nPsa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e., me) in Sheol (or Hades,\nthe grave). This is explained in the next line as meaning “thou wilt not\nsuffer thine Holy One to see corruption.”\n\nSo Act. 2:27; Act. 2:31; Act. 13:35.\n\nIt is resurrection from the grave which is taught and referred to\nhere, as is clear from Psa. 49:15 (16), where Sheo/ is properly\ntranslated “grave.” See under Synecdoche.\n\n3. “Out of the Way.”\nἐκ µέσου (2Th. 2:7) must not be translated literally, arise or become\ndeveloped “out of the midst,” as is done by a certain school of\nprophetic students; because it is a Greek idiom for being out of the\nway, and always implies decisive action, either of the person’s own\nwill or of force on the part of others.\n\nPlutarch (Timol. 238. 3) says: “He determined to live by himself,\nhaving got himself out of the way’ (i.e., from the public).\n\nHerodotus (3. 83 and 8. 22). The speaker (in 8. 22) exhorts some,\nand says: “Be on our side, but if this is impossible, then sit down out of\nthe way,” or as we should say in our idiom “stand aside” (not “arise out\nof the midst”!)\n\nThe same idiom is found in Latin. Terence (Phorm. v. 8. 3) says:\n“She is dead, she is gone from among us” (i.e., forced or torn away by\nthe cruel hand of death, “e medio abiit’).\n\nThe opposite expression shows the same thing.\n\nIn Xenophon (Cyr. v. 2. 26), some one asks: “What stands in the\nway of your joining us?” (ἐν µέσῳ ἑστῆ: i.e., your standing in with us.\n\nThe same idiom is found in the Scriptures.\n\nMat. 13:49.-The wicked are “severed from among the just”: ({6.,\ntaken away by force).\n\nAct. 17:33.-“Paul departed from among them.”\n\nAct. 23:10.-Paul was taken “by force from among them.”\n\n1Co. 5:2 is very clear: where the complaint is made that they had\nnot mourned that “he that hath done this deed might be taken away\nfrom among you.”\n2Co. 6:17.-“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye\nseparate.”\n\nCol. 2:14.-We read of the handwriting of ordinances which was\nagainst us. Christ “took it out of the way.”\n\nWe have the same idiom in the Septuagint.\n\nIsa. 52:11.-“Depart ye ... go ye out of the midst of her,” and\n\nIsa. 57:1 (Ixx. 2).-“The righteous is taken away from the evil to\ncome.”\n\nIt is thus perfectly clear that, in 2Th. 2:7, where it says that he who\nnow holds fast [fo his position] will continue to do so until he is cast\nout, the “he” is Satan, who is holding on to his position in the\nheavenlies, until the great war shall take place (Rev. 12:1-17), and he\nbe cast out into the earth.\n\nThen it is that (Rev. 13:1) “he stands (R.V. [Note: The Revised\nVersion, 1881.] ) on the sand of the sea,” and as the result of this the\ntwo beasts rise up. They cannot, therefore, “arise” till Satan is cast\nout. This is the teaching of 2Th. 2:1-17 See further under Ellipsis.\n\n4. “Breaking of Bread.”\n“To break bread,” κλάσαι ἄρτον (klasai arton), is the literal rendering of\nthe Hebrew idiom 22? 22? (paras lechem), and it means to\npartake of food, and is used of eating as in a meal.* [Note: Just as\namong the Arabs to-day, the Idiom, to eat salt, means partaking of a\nmeal.] The figure (or idiom) arose from the fact that among the\nHebrews bread was made, not in loaves as with us, but in round\ncakes about as thick as the thumb. These were always broken, and\nnot cut. Hence the origin of the phrase {ο break bread. Indeed so\nclose is the connection that we sometimes have the word “break”\nwithout “bread.” So clear is the meaning that there may be the Ellipsis\nof the latter word.\nSee examples of this Hebrew idiom in Jer. 16:7 (see A.V. [Note:\nThe Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]\nmargin) “Neither shall men break bread for them,” as in Eze. 24:17.\nHos. 9:4. See Deu. 26:14, and Job. 42:11.\n\nIsa. 58:7.-“Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry?”\n\nLam. 4:4.-“The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it\nunto them.”\n\nEze. 18:7.-“Hath broken (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] given) bread to the hungry.”\n\nWe have the same Hebrew idiom in the Greek words of the New\nTestament, and the readers could have had no other idea or meaning\nin their minds (Mat. 14:19). He took the five loaves, and blessed, and\nbrake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, etc. This was in\nconnection with ordinary eating. See Mat. 15:36; Mar. 8:6; Mar. 8:19;\nMar. 14:22.\n\nLuk. 24:30.-“And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he\ntook bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.”\n\nIn verse 35, they speak of how Christ “was known of them in\nbreaking of bread,” i.e., as He sat at meat with them.\n\nAct. 27:33-36.-“This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried\nand continued fasting,* [Note: See under Synecdoche.] having taken\nnothing. Wherefore | pray you take some meat: for this is for your\nhealth: ... And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave\nthanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he\nbegan to eat. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took\nsome meat.”\n\nIt is perfectly clear that in all these cases the “breaking of bread” is\nthe ordinary Hebrew idiom for eating as in a meal. The bread could\nnot be eaten till it was broken, hence the idiom which is used by\nHebrews down to the present day.\n\nIt is also evident that the Passover was a meal, and it was at this\nmeal, and of it, that the idiom is used in Mat. 26:26. Mar. 14:22 Luk.\n22:19. 1Co. 11:24.\n\nIn Act. 2:46, their breaking bread at home (margin) is mentioned to\nemphasise the fact that they no longer offered sacrifices, and\ntherefore could not eat of them in the Temple. So that though they\nwent to the Temple to worship, they ate their meat at home in their\nprivate houses.\nIt is incredible, therefore, that in Act. 20:7, the idiomatic expression\ncan mean in any sense the Lord’s supper, as is clear also from verse\n11.\n\nThe one solitary passage left is 1Co. 10:16, “The bread which we\nbreak.” This is referred by some to the Lord’s supper in ignorance of\nthe prevailing custom of the early Christians when meeting together\non the first day of the week. Assemblies were few, and the members\nwere scattered. Many came from long distances, and food had to be\nbrought for the day’s sustenance. The early fathers tell us that the\npeople brought from their own homes hampers filled with cooked\nfowls, and geese, etc., meat, loaves of bread, with skin-bottles of\nwine, etc. The rich brought of their abundance, and the poor of their\npoverty. These Sunday feasts acquired the ecclesiastical name,\nagapai or “love-feasts” (from ἀγάπη, brotherly love, see Jud. 1:12),\nbecause the richer brethren made them for the benefit of the poor.\n\nIt is easy to see how this would in time become a feast; and how,\nthough all partook of the common food, some would have too much,\nand some too little; and, as it is written, some would be hungry, and\nothers drunken (1Co. 11:21).\nThis looks as though the feast or meal itself came to be spoken of\nas “the Lord’s supper,” from the fact that each received an equal\nportion, as on that night when the Lord Himself presided, and received\nit as from Himself and not merely from one another.\n\nBut in process of time, a special ordinance was added at the close\nof these feasts, at the end of the assembly, and at the end of the day.\nto which the name, “the Lord’s supper,” was afterwards confined, Up\nto the time of Chrysostom it followed the feast; but, as superstition\nincreased, it preceded the feast; but for 700 years after Christ they\naccompanied each other: and the Lord’s supper was unknown as a\nseparate ordinance!\n\nAs late as a.d. 692 the close of the Lenten fast was celebrated by\nan agapee, or feast, as the anniversary of the institution of the Lord’s\nsupper; and in England the day was called Maunday Thursday, from\nthe maunds, i.e., the baskets or hampers in which the provisions were\nbrought. No one but Royalty now keeps up this ancient custom. It fell\ninto desuetude from the superstition of “fasting communion;” which\nhad been brought in (though Chrysostom wished himself anathema if\nhe had been guilty of it!).\n\nThe “breaking of bread” therefore was used of the love-feast, and\nnever, until recent years, used of the Lord’s supper as a separate\nordinance.\n\nThe error has arisen from the misunderstanding of the Hebrew\nidiom; and, from translating literally that which is used as a figurative\nexpression.\n\nRome has done exactly the same, though in another direction.\nRome forces the words “to break bread,” to prove its practice of\nwithholding the cup from the laity, or of communion in one kind! Rome\nargues that as it only says “bread,” and wine is not mentioned;\ntherefore the “wafer” is sufficient!\n\nHad Gentiles been acquainted with the Hebraism, neither malice\nnor ignorance could have diverted the words from their simple and\nonly meaning.\n\n5. To “Take the Sword” is used for rashly usurping magisterial power\ninstead of giving obedience and subjection to God\nMat. 26:52.\n6. To “Open the Mouth’ is a Hebraism, used for speaking at length or\nwith great solemnity, liberty, or freedom\nJdg. 11:35-36. Job. 3:1; Job. 33:2. Psa. 78:2. Pro. 31:26. Eze. 24:27.\nDan. 10:16. Mat. 5:2, with 13:35. Luk. 1:64. Act. 8:35; Act. 10:34. 2Co.\n6:11. Rev. 13:6.\n\nSo the opposite, “not to open the mouth,” is a Hebraism for\nsilence:- Psa. 38:13 (14); 39:9 (10). Pro. 24:7. Isa. 53:7. Act. 8:32.\n\n7. To “Taste Wine’ is a Hebraism for drinking with others to\nindulgence\n\nDan. 5:2.\n\nSo also to “drink wine.” Pro. 31:4.\n\n8. “What to me and to thee?”\n\nti ἐμοὶ Kai Goi (ti emoi kai soi) which is rendered, “What have | to do\nwith thee?” means what is there between thee and me: i.e., what have\nwe in common.\n\n2Sa. 16:10; 2Sa. 19:22. 1Ki. 17:18. 2Ki. 3:13. Mat. 8:29. Mar. 1:24.\nLuk. 4:34. Joh. 2:4.\n\n9. “The Son of Man”\n\nUnder Synecdoche we have considered the ordinary meaning of “Son\nof Man”; but, with the definite article, the phrase appears to have a\nspecial idiomatic usage of its own. No one was ever so called, but\nChrist Himself. He first thus calls Himself in Joh. 1:51 (52). The\nreference is to the first occurrence of the phrase in Psa. 8:1-9, where\nthe title is seen to involve universal dominion in the earth. Dominion\nwas given to the first man, Adam, and lost. It is to be restored in “the\nSon of man,” “the second man,” “the Lord from Heaven.”\n\nFrom Joh. 12:34 (cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] 8:28),\nthe Jews rightly inferred that the title involved His Messiahship.\nThat the title has to do with dominion in the earth is clear from the\nfact that it does not occur in the Epistles, and does not, therefore,\npertain to Christ in relation to the Church-the Body of which He is the\nHead, though it occurs constantly in the Gospels, as well as in the\nApocalypse (but here only twice: 1:13, and 14:14).* [Note: See The\nDivine Names and Titles, by the same author and publisher.]\n\n10. “Turn to Ashes”\nPsa. 20:3.-This was the Hebrew idiom for God’s acceptance of\nofferings by fire: iie., He accepted them by causing fire to fall from\nheaven and consume the sacrifice. No fire having its origin in this\nworld ever consumed the sacrifices which God accepted.\n\nThe sacrifices of the heathen were wholly independent of and\napart from God. He neither commanded them, nor accepted them. It is\neven so with all worship now that is not the fruit of the Holy Spirit (who\nis symbolized by burning fire). For the flesh to offer worship is the\noffering of “strange fire.”\n\nThe fire which kindled the incense on the Golden Altar of worship\nwithin the Holy Place was the same fire which had consumed the\nsacrifice on the Brazen Altar. This tells us that there can be no incense\nof prayer ascending to heaven that is not based on and does not\nproceed from the blood of atonement.\n\nThat this fire from heaven was the essential part of God’s\nacceptance of the offering may be seen from the fact that the fire of\nGod fell from heaven at the first (Lev. 9:24) (at the Tabernacle), and\nagain at the Temple (2Ch. 7:1), and that fire was kept continually\nburning.\n\nWhenever God accepted an offering away from the one place\nwhich He had appointed the fire fell especially upon that occasion\nonly. See Gideon, Jdg. 6:21; Manoah, Jdg. 13:15-23; David, 1Ch.\n21:26; and Elijah, 1Ki. 18:38.\n\nThis, therefore, is what is meant in Gen. 4:4, when” the Lord had\nrespect unto Abel and to his offering,” because it was what He had\nordered. But to Cain and his offering God “had not respect,” because it\nwas not what He had appointed. “The way of Cain” (Jud. 1:11) is\ntherefore human inventions in Divine worship!\n\nThis is how Abel “obtained witness that he was righteous.” This is\nhow “God testified of his gifts.” This is how Abel “being dead, yet\nspeaketh” (Heb. 11:4), but few hear his voice. Few understand the\ngreat fact that God left nothing for man’s imagination when He made\nknown how He would be approached, and how He would be\nworshipped. In the last chapter of Exodus (40.), we have fourteen\ntimes “thou shalt” (2-15), in the directions given to Moses; and eight\ntimes the significant words that all was done “as the Lord commanded\nMoses.” Then Leviticus, the book of worship, opens with the words:\n“And the Lord called unto Moses ... out of the Tabernacle of the\ncongregation (for Moses was not able to enter in, Exo. 40:35), saying\n... If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring,”\netc.\n\nThus it is the Lord who dictates the particulars as to how He will be\napproached. And, if He does not accept the sacrifice by turning it to\nashes, in vain would they worship Him.\n\nIt is the same to-day. The true worshippers, who worship God, do\nso in spirit, and through that sacrifice which God has accepted, even\nChrist our substitute, on whom the Divine judgment fell instead of on\nHis People. “BY HIM?” it is that we offer the sacrifice of praise to God\ncontinually, that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name (Heb.\n13:15).\n\nThere is no other worship now which He accepts, and no other\nworshippers whom the Father seeks to worship Him (Joh. 4:23).\n\n11. “The Sons of God” (Sons of Elohim)\nThis is the Hebrew idiomatic expression for angels. In every place\nwhere the expression occurs, angelic beings are to be understood. It\noccurs in:\n\nGen. 6:2; Gen. 6:4. Job. 1:6; Job. 2:1.-Where it is 27227222?\n(benai ha-Elohim), sons of the Elohim.\n\nJob. 38:7.-Where it is without the article, “Sons of Elohim.”\n\nPsa. 29:1; Psa. 89:6 (7).-Where it is 2??? 22232 (benai Eyleem),\nsons of Eyleem.\n\nDan. 3:25.-Where it is singular, “A son (Chald., 2?) of God.”\n\nSeven times in all, and in each case it means angels.* [Note: In\nHos. 1:10 (2:1), it is a different form 7??? 2? 2? (Benai El hai),\nsons of the living God. The context leaves us in no doubt that this is\nused of men, and not angeles, for it is put in contrast with 22?\n(ammai), my people.]\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that angels are meant in Gen. 6:2; Gen. 6:4,\nand their “sin” is there recorded. How it was committed we are not\ntold. In 2Pe. 2:4; 2Pe. 2:9 and Jud. 1:6, it is further described, and is\nspoken of in connection with Noah. Is it not strange that in 1Pe.\n3:18-19, where exactly the same connections occur (i.e., “Noah,” and\n“chains,” and “prison”), they should be taken for men! Especially when\nwe recall the statement that “He maketh His angels spirits” (Psa.\n104:4. Heb. 1:7), and that man is never spoken of as a “spirit.” He is\nsaid to have a spirit, but not to be one.\n\nIn Gen. 6:4, the progeny of these fallen angels is called\nNepheleem: i.e., the fallen ones (from 220, naphal, to fall): and so\nawful were the consequences that all flesh was corrupt, and Noah was\nthe only one who was not tainted.* [Note: The two words “generations”\nare not the same in Gen. 6:9. The first is Toledoth, meaning the off\nspring in succession, while the second is Dorothai, which has respect\nto breed (Isa. 53:8).]\n\nAll the race, therefore, had to be destroyed. Noah’s sons’ wives\nwere tainted, and this may be the solution of the Ethnological problem\nas to the different races. There were Nepheleem in the days of Moses\n(Num. 13:33), because it appears from Gen. 6:4 that there was\nanother irruption “after that”: {6., after the days of Noah. It was for the\nextermination of this awful breed of beings that Israel was used: and\nyet there are Christians with an excess of (false) charity who deplore\nthe slaughter effected by Israel, forgetting the necessity for the\ndestruction.\nIt was to these fallen angels, “reserved” and “in prison” in Tartarus\n(the utmost bounds of creation) that the triumph of Christ reached and\nwas proclaimed-an encouragement to those who now “suffer’-bidding\nthem too, to look forward to the “glory” which shall surely\nfollow.t [Note: See The Spirits in Prison, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\n12. “Three days and three nights”\nJon. 1:17 (2:1), quoted in Mat. 12:40.\n\nThe expression, “three days and three nights,” is an idiom which\ncovers any parts of three days and three nights.\n\nIn 1Sa. 30:11 (12), it is said that a certain Egyptian had not eaten\nbread and drunk water for “three days and three nights,” and yet it was\nonly three days since he fell sick (ver. 13), not four days.\n\nIn Est. 4:16, Esther says she and her maidens will fast “three days\nand three nights,” and yet it was on “the third day” that Esther went in\nto the king; not the fourth day, which it must have been if the\nexpression were literally understood.\n\nIt may seem absurd to Gentiles and to Westerns to use words in\nsuch a manner, but that does not alter the fact.\nNow the New Testament is for the most part Hebrew in idiom, but\nGreek in /anguage. This is the simple explanation of the difference\nbetween it and classical Greek. Moreover, there is reason to believe\nthat the First Gospel, as we have it, is a translation from a Hebrew\nOriginal. This is one of the idioms. It is used in Jon. 1:17 (2:1), and by\nour Lord in Mat. 12:40. And yet many Scriptures say that He should\nrise, and did actually rise on “the third day.” This could not have been\nif the expression were used in its literal sense. It must have been the\nfourth day and not the “third.”\n\nThe fact is that the idiom covers any part of “three days and three\nnights.” This method of Hebrew reckoning is as distinct from Gentile\nreckoning, as their commencing the day at sunset and our\ncommencing it at midnight. All these different modes of reckoning are\npeculiar to the respective peoples and languages and must be duly\ntaken into account.\n\nThe Lord’s words in Mat. 12:40 do not disagree with the Scripture\nassertion that He should rise on “the third day.”\n\nWe have the expression “after three days” once (Mat. 27:63), and\n“in three days” once (Joh. 2:19). But the common expression is “on\nthe third day,” and it occurs ten times. But if the expression be literal\nand not an idiom, all these passages should say the fourth day! Paul\npreached the resurrection on “the third day” according to the\nScriptures (1Co. 15:4), and this is the great Scriptural fact which we\ncannot get away from.\n\nNeither can we alter the fact that He rose on “the first day of the\nweek.”\n\nNeither can we alter the history which records His death and burial\nas taking place the day before the Sabbath. “The sabbath drew on”\n(Luk. 23:54. Mat. 27:62); “the day before the sabbath” (Mar. 15:42);\nand yet the two disciples going to Emmaus on the first day of the week\nsay, “This is the third day (not the fourth) since these things were\ndone” (Luk. 24:21).\n\nFrom all this it is perfectly clear that nothing is to be gained by\nforcing the one passage (Mat. 12:40) to have a literal meaning, in the\nface of all these other passages which distinctly state that the Lord\ndied and was buried the day before the Sabbath and rose the day\nafter it, viz., on the first day of the week. These many statements are\nliteral and are history: but the one passage is an idiom which means\nany part of “three days and three nights.” The one complete day and\nnight (24 hours) and the parts of two nights (36 hours in all) fully\nsatisfy both the idiom and the history.\n\nIt may be added that we have a similar usage in English. When a\nperson is sentenced to “three days’ imprisonment,” it may be late in\nthe evening of the first day when he arrives at the prison, but when the\ndoors open on the morning of the third day (not the fourth) he walks\nout a free man. In other words, if a person is commited to prison for\nthree days-and he reaches it on Monday night-he leaves it the first\nthing on Wednesday morning.\n\nSee The Coming Prince, by Dr. Robert Anderson, C.B.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n“Thou sayest” is not, as is generally supposed, an idiomatic\nexpression, conveying merely a simple affirmation or consent.\nThe fact is that εἶπας (ejpas) already means “thou saidst,” for the\npronoun is included in and forms part of the verb. If therefore the\npronoun σύ (su), thou, is used as well, it makes it very emphatic; and\nindeed it places all the emphasis upon the pronoun (thou) instead of\non the verb (sayest) and causes the phrase to mean “thou (and not !)\nhast said it,” or It is thou that madest the statement, or Thou hast said\nit thyself. So clear is this emphasis that the words “and not I” are often\nadded.* [Note: Euripides and Sophocles both have examples. See\nWetstein. And compare Mat. 27:11. Mar. 15:2. Luk. 22:70; Luk. 23:3.\nJoh. 18:37; (and Sept. Exo. 10:29).] So, too, σὺ λέγεις (su legeis),\nthou thyself dost allege.\n\nSee, eg., Mat. 26:25 : “Then Judas, which betrayed him,\nanswered and said., Master, is it 1? He said unto him, Thou hast said it\nthyself,” not I. Thou hast taken the fatal word “traitor” on thine own\nlips.\n\nSo, in Mat. 26:63-64, the High Priest (before whom Jesus had held\nhis peace) asked, “Tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.”\nJesus saith unto him, “Thou hast said it thyself,” not |. | neither affirm it\nnor deny it. Thou hast spoken the word. But then not to leave the\nmatter in further suspense, Jesus says: “Only, | tell you, hereafter ye\nwill see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming\nupon the clouds of heaven.”\n\nIt has been suggested that σὺ εἶπας (su eipas), thou saidst, should\nbe read in the text of Mat. 16:18, instead of σὺ εἶΠέτρος (su е! Petros),\nthou art Peter.\n\nBut this is merely an invention to get out of a supposed difficulty. It\nis based on the fact that in the most ancient MSS. there were no\ndivisions between the words, and hence it has been suggested that\nthe three words\n\nΣΥ ΕΙ ΠΕΤΡΟΣ (su εἰ Petros)\nthou art Petros (i.e., Peter,-or a stone)\nmight originally have been written as one word,\nΣΥΕΙΠΣ (sueips),\nand could be differently divided into two words, thus:-\nΣΥ ΕΙΠΣ (su eps, abbr. of ejpas)\nthou saidst.\nBut against this are to be placed the following objections:\n1. There are the Palrographical objections as to the suggested\nabbreviations (a) of εἷρς for е/рез or eipas; (0) of ps for petros. The\nonly known ancient abbreviation of Petros or Peter is in one of the\nVienna Papyrus Fragments from Fay#lm, where it is written MET.\n(pet.* [Note: See the Supplementum Nov. Test. Grrci, 1896, p. 67. By\nEd. Nestl\', of Ulm] ), ie., the first three letters instead of the first and\nthe last.\n\n2. There is the objection arising from the absence of definite ms.\nauthority, which makes the evidence conjectural rather than\ndocumentary.\n\n3. There is the objection arising from the actual context, which is\nunquestioned; the two words “thou sayest” do not follow at all. Try it:\n“And | say to thee, That thou saidst, and upon this rock | shall build My\nChurch.” It will be seen at once that the difficulty is increased instead\nof being removed! Had the words been in the previous verse, the case\nwould be different; but, coming after the declaration in verse 17, and\nespecially after the formula, “And | also say to thee,” the words “thou\nsaidst’ seem to be quite impossible.\n\nThe best exposition of the passage is that which distinguishes\nbetween the two words petros, a stone, a rolling stone, a stone for\nthrowing; and petra, a rock, or cliff, which cannot be moved.\n\nThou art a petros (a vacillating, unstable man, no one can build on\nthee), but upon this petra (this rock which flesh and blood cannot\nreveal, but which is revealed only by God Himself, upon Christ as “the\nSon of God”), | shall build My Assembly.\nAnd so it came to pass. For in Gal. 1:15-16 Paul says, “When it\npleased God ... to reveal His Son in me, that | might preach him\namong the Gentiles; immediately | conferred not with flesh and blood”:\nie., | conferred not with those who know not all the truth involved in\npreaching Christ as “the Son of God.” For all such are born of blood,\nor of the will of the flesh, and they learn these truths only by Divine\nrevelation. We have the same word “reveal” in Mat. 16:17 (as we have\nalso “flesh and blood”) and Gal. 1:16, which is most significant. Paul\nwas the wise master-builder. Paul was the first to preach Christ as “the\nSon of God,” as declared in Act. 9:20. This therefore was the petra-the\nrock foundation of the Church of the living God; and no mere petros or\nunstable man. Thus we have the contrast between the two, the petros\nand the petra, the stone and the ROCK.\n\nix. Idioms arising from other Figures of Speech\nCertain idiomatic phrases arise out of other Figures of Speech, and\nthey will be found, as scattered examples, throughout this work.\n\nFor example, Pleonasm gives rise to a few; but the following are\nimportant, from Anthropopatheia. They will be found under that figure:\n\n“To hide from one’s eyes.\nTo swear by one’s soul.\nTo hide one’s face.\n\nTo hide one’s eyes.\n\nTo spare with the eyes.\nTo stretch forth the hand.\nTo put forth the hand.\n\nTo shake the hand.\n\nTo make the hand heavy.\nTo make the hand light.\nTo withdraw the hand.\n\nTo turn the hand upon.\nTo lift up the hand.\n\nTo spread forth the hand.\nTo turn the hand back.\nTo smite or clap the hands.\nTo open the hand,”\n\netc. etc.\n\nSynecdoche and Metonymy also give rise to the peculiar usage of\ncertain words in certain phrases: and these Figures must be referred\nto, as it is unnecessary to repeat them here.\n\nx. Changes of Usage of Words, in the Greek Language\nThese may be added as another class: where the meanings of words\nchange in the course of centuries, even among the same people.\n\nThe Greek of the New Testament is, as we have seen, full of the\nidioms of another language (Hebrew). But there is more than this.\nGreek is a language which was spoken and used by different races\nunder different conditions at different times and in different countries.\n\nIn the interpretation of Scripture, we have to take into account the\nfact that Greek was a living language, and was consequently marked\nby constant gradual changes. The New Testament Greek is four\ncenturies later than Attic Greek. It is, therefore, impossible for us to\ndepend solely on Attic Greek for its understanding and meaning.\n\nExamples could be given of these changes:-\n\nζωοτπεῖν (z66poiein) which meant in classical Greek to produce\nlive offspring, had changed to preserve alive or make alive, to quicken.\n\nπάροικος (paroikos) which meant neighbour, had come to mean\nSojourner.\n\nπράκτωρ. (praktér) which meant tax-gather, had come to mean\nJjailor (Mat. 5:25. Luk. 12:58). We learn this from the use of the word in\nthe recently discovered Раруп.\n\nOn the other hand, Modern Greek exhibits similar changes of New\nTestament Greek: e.g.,\n\nΧρόνος which meant time, is used to-day in Greece of a year.\n\nκαιρός which meant season, is to-day in Greece used of weather.\nIt is clear therefore that any correct interpretation of New\nTestament Greek must take into account, not only particular usages,\nbut also changes of usage. This properly comes under /diom, and\nforms one of its most interesting and important branches. Biblical\nGreek occupies an unique position, and has never yet secured the\nattention and study which it demands. It is a neglected study, and is\ndestitute alike of Lexicon and Grammar.* [Note: The late Professor\nHatch, of Oxford, has shown the importance of this branch of Biblical\nstudy, and laid the foundations for it in his Essays in Biblical Greek.\nClarendon Press, 1889.]\n\nWe can, here, give only a few examples of the idiomatic usage of\ncertain important Greek words in the New Testament, which had been\nchanged from their original classical meaning, and were used in a\ndifferent Biblical sense. It is clear that many words which had been\nused by heathens could not possibly be brought into use in the sphere\nof spiritual and Divine truths without considerable modifications, and,\nin some cases, important changes.\n\nThe same phenomenon is encountered to-day, wherever the\nattempt is made to translate the Bible into a heathen language.\n\nThe knowledge of these changes as they affect the more important\ntheological words is absolutely necessary to the correct interpretation\nof the New Testament Scriptures.\n\nDr. Hatch gives (among others) the following instructive\nexamples:-\n\nἀγγαρεύειν (angareuein). In classical Greek it was used with strict\nreference to the Persian system of mounted couriers (Herod. 8. 98.\nXen. Cyr. 8. 6, 17).\n\nBut the customs of other countries changed the meaning to the\nforced transport of military baggage (Jos. Ant. 13. 2, 3. Epictetus,\nDiss. 4. 1, 79).\n\nIn the New Testament, therefore, it is used of being compelled to\ncarry the load or baggage of another person. See Mat. 5:41; Mat.\n27:32. Mar. 15:31. Compare Luk. 3:14.\n\nἀναγινώσκειν (anaginéskein) meant originally to persuade; then, to\nknow well, to gather exact knowledge of, hence to read.\n\nBut later usage extended the reading to reading aloud with\ncomments so as to persuade others. (See Epictetus, Diss. 3. 23, 20\nand 1. 10, 8).\n\nSo in the New Testament (Mat. 24:15. Mar. 13:14), “Let him that\nreadeth” means let him who reads and comments on these words in\nthe assembly take care to understand them.\n\nIt explains also 1Ti. 4:13.\n\natrootopatiZelv (apostomatizein). Its classical use was to dictate to\na pupil what he was to learn by heart and afterwards recite.\n\nBut its later use was widened to the examination by questioning as\nto what had been already taught (Pollux 2. 102).\n\nHence in Luk. 11:53, where it is rendered “provoke him to speak,”\nit means they began to put questions to Him as if they were\nquestioning a pupil.\n\nἀρετή (aretee) in classical Greek meant excellence of any kind,\nespecially of manly qualities. Hence, Latin, vir-tus, manhood, valour,\nprowess, skill.\n\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used\nfor the translation of 222 (héd), glory. Hab. 3:3. Zec. 6:13.\n\nAlso of 2??? (thillah), praise. Isa. 42:8; Isa. 42:12; Isa. 43:21;\nIsa. 63:7.\nIn the New Testament, therefore, it must have one of these two\nsenses. See Php. 4:8 (virtue). 1Pe. 2:9 (praises). 2Pe. 1:3 (virtue); 1:5\n(virtue).\n\nγλωσσόκομον (glé6ssokomon) was the case in which the tongues\n(γλῶσσαι) of musical instruments were kept (fongue-case).\n\nAll trace of this vanishes in later Greek, and it was used of any\nchest, especially of what we should call the strong-box, or coffer.\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used\nin 2Ch. 24:8; 2Ch. 24:10-11. See 2Ki. 12:9, etc., where we have\nκιβωτός (kib6tos), of what we should call the money-box.\n\nHence its meaning and use in Joh. 12:6; Joh. 13:29.\n\nδεισιδαΐµων (deisidaim6n) and δεισιδαιµονία (deisidaimonia) were\nused of religion or religiousness in a good sense.\n\nBut in later Greek they were used in a bad sense; and this is the\nsense in Act. 17:22; Act. 25:19.\n\nδιάβολος (diabolos) was used of slanderous or malicious\naccusation.\n\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used\nwith or without the article of a single person, like the Heb. 222,\nSatan; and 22, Tsar. See 1Ch. 21:1. Est. 7:4; Est. 8:1. Psa. 109:6\n(LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , 109:6). (See\nNum. 22:22, where opposition is the meaning without implying\naccusation of any kind.)\n\nIn the New Testament it is used as a proper name, except in 1Ti.\n3:11. 2Ti. 3:3. Tit. 2:3, where it is used as an adjective, and in its\nordinary sense of malicious accuser.\n\nδιαθήκη (diatheekee). In classical Greek it had two meanings: (1) a\nlast will or testament, and (2) very rarely, of a covenant.\n\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used\n280 times, and always of a covenant. This is its only use in the New\nTestament, and though it is translated “testament” several times, it\nshould always be covenant. For Heb. 9:16-17, see under Ellipsis.\n\nDr. Hatch observes that “the attempt to give it in certain passages\nits classical meaning of ‘testament’ is not only at variance with its use\nin Hellenistic Greek, but is probably also the survival of a mistake: in\nignorance of the philology of later and vulgar Latin, it was formerly\nsupposed that ‘testamentum,’ by which the word is rendered in the\nearly Latin versions as well as in the Vulgate, meant ‘testament’ or\n‘will,’ whereas in fact it meant also, if not exclusively, ‘covenant.’ ”\n\nθρησκεία (threeskeia) was used (in the pl. [Note: |. The Plural\nNumber.] ) by Herodotus (2. 37) of external ceremonies of the\nEgyptian priests.\n\nIn Biblical Greek it is not used of these, but is transferred to any\nsimilar ceremonial observances and to these only: not of Christianity,\nbut of that which has its origin in feelings or experiences, or of piety.\nThis is its meaning in Act. 26:5 (“religion”). Col. 2:18 (“worshipping”).\nJam. 1:26-27 (“religion”).\n\nµυστήριον (musteerion) always rendered or rather transliterated\n“mystery”; but meaning a secret. See a pamphlet on The Mystery, by\nthe same author and publisher.\n\nοἰκονόμος was used of managing a household, hence manager.\n\nBut in later Greek it was specially used of a slave who gave the\nother slaves their rations. So Luk. 12:42. Gal. 4:2. Also of a land-\nsteward, or as we should say an “agent.” Luk. 16:1; Luk. 16:3; Luk.\n16:8. Rom. 16:23.\n\nπειράζειν (peirazein) usually translated to tempt: and πειρασμός\n(peirasmos), temptation.\n\nThe classical use of the verb was to make proof or trial of (Homer,\nOd. 16. 319; 23. 114; 9. 281). To make an attempt (Polyb. Fr. hist. 60).\n\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] the\nmeaning was extended to the mode of trial: viz., by affliction or\ndisaster. Hence “trial” came to mean trouble: as being that which most\neffectually tries anyone.\nIn the New Testament there are several passages where this\nsense of tribulation, trouble, and even chastisement and persecution\nare the more suitable renderings:-\n\nLuk. 8:13 (Mat. 13:21. Mar. 4:17).\nMat. 6:13 (Luk. 11:4) Bring us not into trial, but deliver us from him, or\nthat, which does the mischief.\nMat. 4:1 (Mar. 1:13. Luk. 4:2) to be tried or afflicted by the devil\n(hence Heb. 4:15).\n\nAct. 20:19 -“Perils”: i.e., hardships through the plots and conspiracies\nof the Jews (2Co. 11:24; 2Co. 11:26). Heb. 2:18. 1Pe. 1:6; 1Pe. 4:12.\nRev. 3:10.\n\nπονηρός (poneeros) is defined by Aristotle as being only weak,\nhaving a good-will, and therefore only “half-wicked,” because what is\ndone is not done from malice.\n\nOn the contrary in the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325\nb.c.).] , the meaning seems to point to the activity of mischief: of wild\nbeasts (Gen. 37:20. Eze. 14:15): of the plagues of Egypt (Deu. 7:15):\nof blood-shedding (Isa. 59:7): of violence and mischief (Isa. 35:9; Isa.\n10:1).\n\nSo in the New’ Testament, active harmfulness and\nmischievousness are the prevailing meaning. Mat. 5:11; Mat. 5:39;\nMat. 6:13; Mat. 22:18 (Mar. 12:15. Luk. 20:23). Mat. 12:45 (Luk.\n11:26).\n\nIn some of the apocryphal books, the sense seems to be that of\ngrudging (Sir. 14:4-5; Sir. 31:23). See Pro. 23:6. Deu. 28:56. In the\nNew Testament this seems to be the sense in Mat. 6:19-24; Mat. 7:11\n(Luk. 11:13); Mat. 20:15.\n\nπαράκλητος (parakleetos) meant in classical Greek merely called\nto one’s aid, assisting, especially in a court of justice. Hence a legal\nadviser or helper.\n\nBut this falls short of the meaning it afterwards obtained: viz., not\nonly of helping another to do a thing, but to help him by doing it for\nhim. № is used only in John of the Holy Spirit\'s help (by Christ) in\n14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7. And of Christ’s help (by the Holy Spirit) in 1Jn.\n2:1.\n\nTrioti¢ (pistis), faith. In classical Greek, it meant, psychologically,\nconviction: rhetorically, proof which brings about the conviction; and\nmorally, good-faith or mutual trust.\n\nIn Biblical Greek, there is added a fourth usage, which is,\ntheologically, an ideal virtue: viz., a full assurance (Rom. 4:20-21).\nAnd, since it believes that, what God has said He will surely bring to\npass, therefore, its objects are also objects of hope as well as faith\n(Heb. 11:1).\n\nσυκοφαντεῖν (sukophantein). This word meant originally an\ninformer, and was used of one who gave information against persons\nwho exported figs from Attica. Literally, a fig-shewer. Hence a\ninformer; especially with the view of extorting money, a black-mailer\n(Xenophon, Mem. 2. 9, 4-6).\n\nHence in Biblical Greek it comes to have a wider range of\nmeaning, and is used for Hebrew words which mean {ο oppress; and\nthus passed from black-mailing the rich, to the oppression of the poor\nto extort money, etc.\n\nSo Gen. 43:18. (See Gen. 26:20. Lev. 6:2. Deu. 24:14. Job. 10:3;\nJob. 35:9. Psa. 72:4; Psa. 119:122; Psa. 119:134. Pro. 14:31; Pro.\n22:16; Pro. 28:3; Pro. 28:16. Ecc. 4:1; Ecc. 5:7; Ecc. 7:8. Eze. 22:12;\nEze. 22:29. Jer. 6:6.)\n\nIn the New Testament it is used only in Luk. 3:14; Luk. 19:8.\n\nThe distinction between the following words in classical and\nSeptuagint and New Testament Greek is not observed in the\nTranslations:-\n\nπένης (penees) is poor, as opposed to rich: one who has to\nwork for his living.\n\nTITWXOG (ptéchos) is destitute, and in want: a pauper, or\nbeggar.\nπραῦς (praus) is easy-tempered, as opposed to ὀργίλος\n(orgilos), passionate; and πικρός (pikros), bitter or sour.\nταπεινός (tapeinos) is dejected as well as lowly.\nIn the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] these\nwords are used interchangeably to represent the same Hebrew words,\nand do not denote inferiority in morals, but only in outward condition:\nviz., the peasantry (fellahin), who lived quiet, peaceful lives, and were\nthe victims of lawless and powerful oppressors, who plundered and ill-\ntreated them.\n\nSee Psa. 10:9; Psa. 12:5 (6); 34:6; 35:10; 37:14; 40:17 (18); 72:4,\n13; 76:9 (10); 147:6.\n\nThis is the sense underlying these words in the New Testament.\n\nProfessor Deissmann* [Note: Bibelstudien, Marburg, 1895, and\nNeue Bibelstudieu, 1897.] has recently illustrated many New\nTestament idiomatic usages and expressions from the collections of\npapyri at Berlin and Vienna. They were recently discovered in Egypt,\nand are of the age of the Ptolemies. They consist of petitions, letters,\nreceipts, accounts, divorces, bribes, etc. His contention is that these\ncontain marks, not of what is called “New Testament Greek,” but of the\nvernacular usage of words at that time: e.g., he shows that νεόφυτος\n(neophytos) novice (1Ti. 3:6) is used in the papyri of newly planted\npalm trees.\n\nἀθέτησις (atheteesis), disanulling (Heb. 7:18; Heb. 9:26) is used as\na technical legal expression, and is often found with ἀκύρωσις\n(akurésis) a depriving of authority, and in Antithesis to βεβαίωσις\n(bebaidésis), a confirming, or establishing.\n\nаматёртто) (апаретрб), to send up (Luk. 23:7; Luk. 23:11; Luk.\n23:15. Act. 25:21) is used of sending up to a superior authority.\n\nἀπέχω (apech6é), to have in full (Mat. 6:2; Mat. 6:5; Mat. 6:16. Luk.\n6:24) is used in two Еау т receipts dated respectively: Dec. 29th, 44\na.d., and Sept. [Note: ept. The Septuagint Version.] 6th, 57 a.d., of\ngiving a discharge for an account. This gives an ironical turn to these\npassages. See also Php. 4:18.\n\nἐπίσκοποι (episcopoi), overseers (A.V. [Note: The Authorized\nVersion, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , bishops), is used\nof civil functionaries in Rhodes, in the first centuries, both b.c. and\na.d.; and also of an official in the temple of Apollo.\n\nπρεσβύτεροι (presbyteroi), elders, is used of civil functionaries in\nEgypt, and also of temple officials, in the Fay#m papyri.\n\nσφραγίζω (sphragiz6), to seal, is used of certifying as correct. This\nmay explain Rom. 15:28. Joh. 3:33. 2Co. 1:22. Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30.\n\nἄμετανοητος (ametanoeetos), impenitent (Rom. 2:5) occurs in a\npapyrus record of a sale, denoting that there was to be no change in\nit.\n\nβιάζοµαι (biazomai), suffer violence (Mat. 11:12), is usually taken\nas passive, but a Lycian inscription uses it as a deponent: i.e., the\nkingdom of God presses itself on the notice of men.\n\nδοκίµιον (dokimion), the trying (1Pe. 1:7). This usage would render\nJam. 1:3, “What is genuine in your faith.”\n\nἀρετή (aretee), 1Pe. 2:9, “That ye should show forth the praises of\nhim who hath called you.” And 2Pe. 1:3, “Him that hath called us to\nglory and virtue.”\n\nInscriptions are quoted from the Egyptian papyri, which show that\nἀρετή was used at that time in the sense of a display of power. And\nthis is exactly what it means in the above passages; for God’s\nwondrous power is displayed and manifested forth in His calling of His\nPeople. See Eph. 1:18-19. (See above, page 851).\n\nxi. Changes of Usage of Words in the English Language\nIt is most important that these should be carefully noticed: otherwise\nmany words and expressions in the English of the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] cannot\nbe understood.\nIt is most instructive to observe the evidence afforded by many of\nthese changes as to the constant effect of fallen human nature; which,\nin its use of words, is constantly lowering and degrading their\nmeaning:\n\n“All to brake” (Jdg. 9:53). This is an old Anglo-Saxon word\ntobrecan, from which the prefix “to” has got separated. It means\naltogether or completely smashed. (See Spenser’s Faerie Queene: 4.\n7. 66; Milton’s Comus 379, “all to ruffi’d.” So that “all to” meant\n“altogether’).\n\n“And if’ (Mat. 24:48. 1Co. 7:11). “But and if’: i.e., but even if.\n\n“A work” (2Ch. 2:18).\n\n“A fishing” (Joh. 21:3). The “a” is a softening down of the Anglo-\nSaxon “on”: “on sleep” (Act. 13:36).\n\n“Away with” (Isa. 1:13) meant fo tolerate.\n\n“By and by” (Luk. 21:19) meant immediately.\n\n“Come at” (Num. 6:6) meant to come near, as in R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.]\n“Company with” (1Co. 5:9. Compare v. 11) meant to have\ncompany with, as in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : 18., to\nassociate with.\n\n“Do to wit’ (2Co. 8:1) meant make to know (see “Wit” below): to\ncertify.\n\n“Fetched a compass’ (2Ki. 3:9) meant to make a circuit, or round-\nabout course (as in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ). So Act.\n28:13.\n\n“For to do” (Deu. 4:1) Here, the “for” was used in the sense of “in\norder that”. i.e., that ye may do.\n\n“Full well” (Mar. 7:9): i.e., with full knowledge.\n\n“Go to” (Jam. 4:13) meant come now.\n\n“On sleep” (Act. 13:36). The “on” has now become softened in\nmodern usage to “a”-asleep.\n\n“Presently” (1Sa. 2:16. Pro. 12:16. Mat. 21:19; Mat. 26:53. Php.\n2:23) meant immediately.\n\n“Prevent” (Psa. 59:10 (11); Psa. 79:8; Psa. 88:13 (14); Psa.\n119:148. 1Th. 4:15) meant to go or come before, precede. See under\nEllipsis, Psa. 12:6 (7).\n\n“Strike hands” (Job. 17:3) meant to conclude a bargain by\nshaking hands.\n\n“Trow’ (Luk. 17:9) meant to suppose or imagine (A.S., treowian, to\nbelieve).\n\n“Wit” or “to wit” (Gen. 24:21. Exo. 2:4) meant to know. Hence it\ncame to mean any special cleverness (as a noun), and then humour.\nSo “wof’ meant to know (Act. 3:17. Rom. 11:2, etc.), and “witty” (Pro.\n8:12) meant simply skilful or clever, and “wittingly’ (Gen. 48:14)\nknowingly, skilfully.\n\n“Wist” (Mar. 14:40) is the past tense of wit, knew. “Unwittingly’\n(Jos. 20:3) meant unknowingly. R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] margin, through error.\n\n“Whit” (1Sa. 3:18. 2Co. 11:5). This is the Anglo-Saxon, wiht, a\nperson or thing; hence “not a whit’ meant not at all.\n\n“Very” (Gen. 27:21. Pro. 17:9. Joh. 7:26; Joh. 8:4) meant true,\nreal.\n\nSo there are certain words which have changed their meaning in\nthe course of years:-\n\n“Advisement” (1Ch. 12:19) meant deliberation: from the Latin ad,\nto, and visum, seemed good).\n\n“Adventure” (Deu. 28:56. Act. 19:31) meant to venture to go.\n\n“Artillery” (198. 20:40). This meant (from the Low Latin artillaria,\nany warlike weapons, hence) bows and arrows. To-day we confine the\nword to quite another class of weapon.\n\n“Assay” (Job. 4:2) meant to attempt, to try.\n\n“Beeves” (Num. 31:33, etc.) was the plural of “beef”: the Norman-\nFrench for ox.\n\n“Bonnet” (Exo. 28:40) was at one time used of a man’s\nheaddress: and is still so used in Scotland.\n\n“Brigandine” (Jer. 46:4; Jer. 51:3) was a coat of mail. Now we use\nthe word brigand in a special sense.\n\n“Carriages” (Act. 21:15). From the three voices of the Greek Verb\nwe have Carriage (passive: i.e., that which | carry): Carry (middle: i.e.,\nhow | carry myself); Carriage (active: i.e., that which carries me). The\nformer of these uses of the word (from the Passive) is now obsolete.\n“Clouted” (Jos. 9:5) meant patched. And “Clouts” (Jer. 38:11-12).\n\n“To ear” (1Sa. 8:12. Isa. 30:24) meant to plough (from Anglo-\nSaxon erian, to plough). So the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] now renders it; in 1Sa. 8:12, spelling it “plow,” but in Isa. 30:24,\n“till.” Compare Gen. 45:6, “Neither earing nor harvest.” Exo. 34:21.\nDeu. 21:4.\n\n“Earing” (Gen. 45:6. Exo. 34:21) meant, as in R.V. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] , plowing.\n\n“Eared” (Deu. 21:4) meant ploughed.\n\n“Earnest” (2Co. 1:22. Eph. 1:14) meant a pledge; but differing\nfrom an ordinary pledge in this, that while a pledge might be of a\ndifferent kind, the earnest was a pledge of the same kind.\n\n“Fast” (Rth. 2:8) was used in the sense of close, near.\n\n“Fat” (Joe. 2:24. Mar. 12:1) was used for a Vat, from Anglo-Saxon\nfaet, which was pronounced vat.\n\n“Goodman” (Mat. 20:11) meant householder (as in Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] ).\n“Libertines” (Act. 6:9), a class of freedmen amonst the Romans.\n\n“Lusty” (Jdg. 3:29) meant merely vigorous; and Lust meant simply\npleasure or desire generally, as Exo. 15:9. Deu. 12:15, etc. 2Ti. 4:3 :\nJoh. 8:44. 1Jn. 2:16. Now we use it of one special form of desire.\n\n“Mote” (Mat. 7:3) is the Anglo-Saxon mot, i.e., a particle of dust.\n\n“Naughty” (Pro. 6:12; Pro. 17:4. Jer. 24:2) meant worth naught,\nworthless. Now we use it of any evil, and sometimes of some special\nform.\n\n“Nephew” (Jdg. 12:14. Job. 18:19) meant a grandson. See Isa.\n14:22. 1Ti. 5:4 from the Latin nepos.\n\n“Occupy” (Luk. 19:13) meant fo carry on business, to trade, from\nthe Latin occupare, to lay hold of. Hence our word “occupation.”\n\n“Outgoings,” Jos. 17:9. Psa. 65:8 (9), meant utmost limits.\n\n“Penny” (Mat. 20:2) was used of any piece of money. Even silver\nmoney used to be so called. Hence the phrase: “to turn a penny.” In\nIcelandic, peningr means cattle, as well as money. Now it is limited to\na particular coin, which we represent by “d” (the initial of denarius). “A\npenny a day” was the idiom for the ordinary wage for such labour. In\nLuk. 10:35, the “two pence” equalled two days’ wages or double pay.\n\n“Publican” (Mat. 9:10, etc., etc.) was the Latin Publicanus, a tax-\ncollector. Now the usage is changed to a Vintner.\n\n“Quick” (Lev. 13:10; Lev. 13:24. Num. 16:30. Psa. 55:15; Psa.\n124:3. Isa. 11:3. Act. 10:42. 2Ti. 4:1. Heb. 4:12. 1Pe. 4:5) is the Anglo-\nSaxon cwic, alive, as opposite to dead. Now we use it in the sense of\nlively as opposite to sluggish. So\n\n“Quicken” means to make alive (Psa. 71:20; Psa. 80:18; Psa.\n119:25; Psa. 119:37; Psa. 119:40; Psa. 119:88; Psa. 119:107; Psa.\n119:149; Psa. 119:154; Psa. 119:156; Psa. 119:159; Psa. 143:11.\nRom. 13:11).\n\n“Quickened,” made alive (Psa. 119:50; Psa. 119:93. 1Co. 15:36.\nEph. 2:1; Eph. 2:5. 1Pe. 3:18.\n\n“Quickeneth,” maketh alive (Joh. 5:21; Joh. 6:63. Rom. 4:17. 2Co.\n3:6 (тагд. [Note: arg. Margin.] ). 1Ti. 6:13.\n\n“Quickening,” making alive (1Co. 15:45).\n\n“Silly” (Job. 5:2. Hos. 7:11. 2Ti. 3:6) meant, originally, as Anglo-\nSaxon, saelig, timely, then, happy, and innocent. But now, because a\nperson who acts thus is supposed by the world to be foolish, so it has\ncome to be used. The same is the case with the word\n\n“Simple,” which meant, originally, without guile, open, artless. But\nnow, because a person who acts thus, is considered devoid of all\nsense, it has come to mean foolish. In the Bible the word is used in its\noriginal sense, as the usage had not then changed. See Psa. 19:7 (8);\n119:6; 119:130. Pro. 1:4; Pro. 1:22; Pro. 1:32; Pro. 7:7; Pro. 8:5; Pro.\n9:4; Pro. 9:13; Pro. 14:15; Pro. 14:18; Pro. 21:11; Pro. 22:3. Eze.\n45:20. Rom. 16:18-19.\n“Simplicity” is used in the corresponding sense: 2Sa. 15:1. Pro.\n1:22. Rom. 12:8. 2Co. 1:12; 2Co. 11:3.\n\n“Sottish” (Jer. 4:22) meant stupid, dull, heavy. Now, because а\nperson is made so by drink, its use is limited to stupidity thus induced.\n\n“Vagabond” (Gen. 4:12; Gen. 4:14. Act. 19:13. Psa. 109:10)\nmeant originally, a wanderer, from Latin vagari, to wander. But,\nbecause those who thus wander, are generally compelled to do so on\naccount of their worthless character, so the word came to be limited to\nthis special sense.',''),(148,148,'prosopopoeia','i. The members of the human body\n\nGen. 31:35.-Heb., Let not the eyes of my lord kindle with anger.\n\nSo Gen 45:5 margin: and compare Isa. 3:8.\nGen. 48:14.-“He made his hands to understand” (222, sikkeyl),\nskilful.\nDeu. 13:8.-“Neither shall thine eye pity him.”\n1Ki. 20:6.-“Whatscever is pleasant (or desirable, marg. [Note: arg.\nMargin.] ) in thine eyes”: i.e., pleases thine eyes. So Eze. 24:16 (see\nunder Periphrasis and Metonymy), 21 (see Paronomasia). 1Jn. 2:16.\nJob. 29:11.-“When the ear heard me, then it blessed me and when\nthe eye saw me, it gave witness to me.” How beautiful is this\nProsopopria. № is more than putting the “eye,” by Metonomy, for any\none who used the eye and saw. It is the actual personification of the\neye; and, therefore, much more expressive.\nJob. 31:7.-‘If ... mine heart walked after mine eyes,” i.e., if | covet that\nwhich | have seen. Compare 1Jn. 2:16.\nPsa. 35:10.-“All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee,” etc.\n\nWhen it is written “All my bones,” it is the figure Synecdoche, by\nwhich a part or some of the members are put for the whole being or\nperson. When it is written “shall say,” that is Prosopopria, because\nthey are represented as speaking.\n\nThis is a Psalm of David: and it is therefore true of David’s Son,\nand David’s Lord, as well as of David himself.\n\nDavid could say that he, with all his members and powers, used\nthese words and said, “Jehovah! Who is like unto thee,” etc.\n\nThe Lord Jesus could use them in like manner of Himself. But\nthere is a further application to Christ mystical: a truth not then\nrevealed. All the members of Christ\'s body now say exactly the same\nthing. In Psa. 139:16 we see the formation of those members (1Co.\n12:1-31). We see how they are placed in the Body.\n\nThey are “vexed.” Psa. 6:2 (3).\n\nThey are “sundered” (Psa. 22:14 (15), margin), but never “broken”\n(Psa. 34:20 (21). Exo. 12:46): therefore Christ\'s literal bones were not\nto he broken (Joh. 19:33; Joh. 19:37).\nTheir “hearts” are broken, as His was (Psa. 69:20). See Psa. 34:18\n(19), (and cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] verse 20), but they\nthemselves, never!\n\nThey all are “poor and needy,” and they all say one thing. They all\nown Jesus as “the Lord”; and all confess that there is none like Him.\nSometimes they ask the question (Psa. 89:6 (7); 71:19. Exo. 15:11),\nand sometimes they answer it (Deu. 33:26-27. 1Sa. 2:2).\n\nThey thus confess Him as beyond compare, because He delivers\nthe “poor and needy” from the strong spoiler.\n\nFrom the Law which was too strong (Gal. 3:10; Gal. 3:13).\n\nFrom Sin which is too strong (Rom. 7:23-24; Rom. 5:21).\n\nFrom the World which is too strong (Joh. 16:33), and\n\nFrom Death (2Co. 1:10. 2Ti. 1:10. Hos. 13:14).\n\nPsa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.”\nHere, Ethiopia is first put, by Metonymy (of subject), for the inhabitants\nwho lift up their hands. Otherwise, it is a Prosopopoeia, for Ethiopia\nhas no hands! This will be fulfilled in the day of Psa. 72:15.\nPsa. 73:9.-“Their tongue walketh through the earth.” It is the wicked\nwho walk through the earth, using their tongues against God.\n\nPsa. 103:1.-“All that is within me, bless his holy name.” See also\nSynecdoche and Idiom.\n\nPsa. 119:82.-“Mine eyes fail for thy word”: ie., mine eyes are\nconsumed in looking for the fulfilment of Thy Word: ie.

This is usually treated as an Ellipsis, but by some\n85 a Prosopopoeia. But it is neither.

That it is the grave is clear from the reference to the “worms.”\nIsa. 24:4.-“The earth mourneth.” (See under Paronomasia). Similar\nexamples are seen in verse 7; 33:9. Jer. 4:28; Jer. 12:4. Lam. 2:8.\nHos. 4:3. Joe. 1:10. Amo. 1:2, etc.\n\nIsa. 24:23.-“Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun\nashamed,” etc. And this, in order to emphasise the glory of the\npresence of the Lord.\n\nJer. 51:48.-“Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein,\nshall sing for Babylon”: i.e., the joy over her fall shall be great and\nuniversal.\n\nIsa. 55:12.-“The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you\ninto singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.” And\nthus is emphasised the universal joy of Israel in the coming day of her\nglory, when Jehovah shall comfort her. So Isa. 49:13.\n\nJer. 31:15.-Rachel, long since dead, is represented as weeping. So\nMat. 2:18.\n\nLam. 1:4.-“The ways of Zion do mourn,” etc.This most elegant\nProsopopeeia graphically describes the desolation.\nEze. 32:21-22.-Dead people are represented as speaking out of\nSheol: i.e., the grave, as is clear from the whole context.\n\nVerses 22-32 are about those who have been slain with the sword,\nand are fallen and lying in their graves.\nHos. 2:22 (24).-See also this verse under Anaphora, Climax, and\nPolysyndeton; and compare Deu. 28:23. Jer. 14:22, where the\nheavens and the earth are said to give their substance, or withhold it,\nby the hand of God. So Jon. 1:4.\nRom. 8:19.-“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the\nmanifestation of the sons of God.” See under Metonymy (of Adjunct),\nEllipsis, and Epitrechon.\nRom. 9:20.-“Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast\nthou made me thus?”\nRom. 10:6-8.-“The righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this\nwise,” etc.\nRev. 6:9-10.-The dead are represented as speaking, notwithstanding\nit says that they had been slain.\n\nFor, after the Church shall have been taken away, the Remnant of\nIsrael will be dealt with and go through a “great tribulation” and suffer\ngreat persecution. Many will be martyred and “beheaded for the\nwitness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshipped\nthe beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their\nforeheads or in their hands” (Rev. 20:4).\n\nIn Rev. 6:9, this time of persecution is not yet over, and those who\nhave been slain are represented, by Prosopoposia, as speaking and\nasking, How long it would be before the earth should be judged, and\ntheir blood avenged. That this is not the language of the Church is\nclear; for they address the Lord as Δεσπότης (Despotees): {9.,\nDespot, Master, esp., a master of slaves. Despot (see Luk. 2:29. Act.\n4:24. 2Pe. 2:1. Jud. 1:4). And not as Κύριος (Kurios), Lord, as the\nChurch always does.\n\nThey have “white robes” given to them, thus keeping up the\nProsopopesia.\n\nThe word “souls” is put for persons by Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:\nWhich 5εε.]).\n\nMoreover the dead do not speak.\n\nSee Psa. 115:17; Psa. 146:4, etc.\n\nv. Kingdoms, Countries, and States\n1. A whole people as an individual man\nIsa. 1:5-6.-“Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more\nand more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the\nsole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but\nwounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.” (See under Hypotyposis).\nThus the whole Jewish nation is elegantly addressed as one man. See\nverses 7-9.\nCareful students of the Old Testament, especially in the original,\nwill find abundant instances of this Figure. See Isa. 7:20; Isa. 30:28,\netc.\n\n2. A whole Nation is spoken of as a Man\nLam. 3:1 (2).-“l ат the man that hath seen affliction ... He hath led\nme,” etc.\n\nThis is generally but wrongly taken of Christ. It is the figure by\nwhich a People is personified.\n\nDan. 2:31.-“This great image ... stood before thee.”\n3. A whole People or State as a Woman\nIsa. 32:9-11.-“Rise up, ye women that are at ease;” etc.\n\nHere the whole People is addressed as a class of women. So\nchap. 3:18-26. Mic. 7:8-10, etc.\n\nIdolatrous Israel is spoken of, and to, as an adulterous woman:\nJer. 3:1; Jer. 3:3-4; Jer. 4:30. Eze. 16:1-63 and xxiii. Hos. 2:1-23 etc.\nThis is based on such passages as Exo. 34:15-16. Deu. 31:16. Jdg.\n2:17. Isa. 1:21; Isa. 57:3. Nah. 3:4. Isa. 23:15-17.\n4.

Jos. 15:45; Jos.\n15:47; Jos. 17:11; Jos. 17:16-17. 1Ch. 7:28-29; 1Ch. 18:1-2; 2Ch.\n13:19; 2Ch. 28:18, etc.\nPsa. 45:12 (13).-“The daughter of Tyre”: i.e., as explained by\nEpexegesis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), the rich among the peoples.\nPsa. 137:8.-The “daughter of Babylon.” It is possible that the ‘little\nones” of verse 9 may be small offshoots of Great Babylon, and not\nliteral infants.\nLam. 1:6; Lam. 2:1, etc.-The “daughter of Zion.”\nLam. 2:2.-The “daughter of Judah.”\nZec. 9:9.-“Daughter of Zion,” “Daughter of Jerusalem.”\n\nAnd elsewhere often. See Isa. 1:8; Isa. 10:32; Isa. 16:1; Isa. 37:22.\nJer. 4:31; Jer. 6:2. Mic. 4:10; Mic. 4:13. Zep. 3:10; Zep. 3:14.\nJer. 31:4; Jer. 31:21.-Virgin of Israel.”\n\nSo chap. 18:13, and Amo. 5:2.\n\nSometimes “virgin” and “daughter” are combined. Isa. 23:12; Isa.\n37:22; Isa. 47:1. Jer. 46:11. Lam. 2:13.\n\nvi. Human Actions attributed to Things, etc.\n\nCalled SOMATOPCEIA (S6-mat-o-poe’-ia). Greek σωματοποῇα, from\nσωμα (séma), a body, and ποιεῖν (poiein), to make. Hence, to make\nlike a body or person, as we speak of embodying.\nGen. 4:7.-“Sin lieth at the door.”\n\nSee Metonymy, by which “sin” is put for sin-offering, and this sin-\noffering is a live animal represented as a person waiting at the door.\nThe Hebrew 22? (rahvatz) is specially used of animals.\nGen. 18:20.-“The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great.”\n\nThis is Prosopoposia, whereas in Jam. 5:4 we have it literally.\nGen. 30:33.-“So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to\ncome.”\n\nSee under Antimereia (of Adv.).\nExo. 18:8.-“All the travail that had found them.”\n\nSo Gen. 44:34.

Human and Rational Beings\n1. Parts and Members of Man; or, of the Human Body\nA Soul is attributed to God\nin condescension, so that we may understand His essence and\nwill: i.e., God Himself.\nLev. 26:11.-“And | will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul\nshall not abhor you”: i.e., / myself (see under /diom and Synecdoche).\nSo Psa. 11:5. Isa. 1:14; Isa. 42:1. Jer. 5:9; Jer. 5:29; Jer. 15:1\n(rendered “mind”). Mat. 12:18. Heb. 10:38.\nHence the expression “to swear by one’s soul,” Jer. 51:14. (See\nA.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English\nBible, 1611.] тагд. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) Amo. 6:8, where it is\nrendered, “by himself.”\n\nLam. 3:20.-“And thy soul will condescend to me.”\n\nThis was the primitive text, and we find here one of the eighteen\nemendations of the Sopherim, who altered it to, “My soul is humbled in\nme.” (See Appendix E).\n\nJerusalem, personified, speaks, and says (verses 19, 20)\naddressing God:\n\n“Remember my misery and my forlorn state,\n\nThe wormwood and the gall.\n\nYea, verily, Thou wilt remember,\n\nAnd Thy soul will mourn over me.\n\nThis | recall to my heart,\n\nTherefore | have hope.”\nA Body is used of Christ.\n\nCol. 2:17.-“Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body of\nChrist is the substance”: i.e., Christ Himself, either personally (verse\n9) or mystically.* [№1е: See The Mystery, by the same author and\npublisher.]\n\nSee under Ellipsis, and compare 1Ti. 3:16. Eph. 1:22-23; Eph.\n4:12; Eph. 4:15-16.\n\nThe Head is spoken of Christ.\n1Co. 11:3.-“The head of Christ is God.” This is in respect to His\nhuman nature, and is spoken of Christ as man. Joh. 14:28. Rom. 8:29.\n\nSo Christ is said to be head of the Body: i.e., the Mystical Body.\nEph. 1:22; Eph. 4:15. Col. 1:18. See 1Co. 12:1-31. Hence\nἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι (anakephalaiésasthai), to reduce to one head, ог\nto head up in Eph. 1:10.\n\nThe Face, to signify presence.\n\nIt is used of the Divine presence in happiness and of Divine favour.\nPsa. 16:11 : “In thy face (i.e., presence) is fulness of joy.” So Psa.\n17:15.\n\nExo. 33:20; Exo. 33:23.-Compare 1Co. 13:12. Jon. 1:3. Psa. 51:11\n(13).\n\nPsa. 31:20 (21).-“Thou wilt hide therein the secret of thy face”: i.e., of\nthy presence, in Divine grace and favour.\n\nPsa. 17:2.-“Let my sentence come forth from thy face”: i.e., Thy\npresence or Thyself, in righteousness and truth.\n\nPsa. 89:15 (16).-“They will walk, О Lord, in the light of thy face”: i.e.,\nin the light of Thy presence, enjoying Thy favour and blessing.\n1Ch. 29:12.-“Riches and honour come from thy face”: A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “of\nThee”: i.e., from Thy grace and favour.\n\nSo Num. 6:25-26.

Eze. 39:24.\n\nIt is used of the Divine presence in anger and judgment.\nPsa. 9:3 (4).-“They shall fall and perish from thy face” ({6., at Thy\npresence manifested in judgment).\nPsa. 21:9 (10).-“Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of\nThy face” (i.e., Thy presence in judgment).\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] actually renders this “anger”: but not in\n\nPsa. 34:16.-“The face of the Lord is against them that do evil” ({6., the\nanger of the Lord, as in 21:9 and Lam. 4:16. See A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg.\n[Note: arg. Margin.] )\n\n2Th. 1:9.-“The face of the Lord.” Here, it is rendered “presence.” See\nunder Ellipsis. So 1Pe. 3:12.\n\nIt is used of Jehovah Himself, for emphasis.\n\nExo. 33:14-15, as is explained in verse 16, and Isa. 63:9. Exo. 23:20,\netc., where doubtless Christ is meant by “the angel.”\n\nSo Exo. 23:15 : “None shall appear before my face (i.e., Me) empty.”\nLev. 17:10.-“I will set my face (i.e., myself) against that soul.” So Jer.\n21:10.\n\nHence the shewbread was called the bread of the presence (lit.,\nthe bread of the faces), because it was in the holy place in the\nmanifested presence of God.\n\nExo. 25:30.-“Thou shalt set upon the table the bread of the faces\n(2222, pahneem) before me (2222, I\'phahnai) alway.” Observe\nthe Paronomasia (q.v.

[Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,\npresence): i.e., from Thee.\n\n2Ch. 7:14.\nHence “Face to face” means great intimacy. Deu. 5:4; Deu. 34:10.\nNum. 12:6-7, etc., which is explained by Exo. 20:18-21. In Num. 12:8\nwe have “mouth to mouth” for the first time. See below.\n\nEyes are attributed to God.\n\n2Sa. 16:22.-“The Lord will behold with his eye.” This was the primitive\ntext; and is one of the eighteen passages altered by the Sopherim\n(see Appendix E) to “mine eye,” which has been taken (by Metonymy)\nto stand for tears or affliction.\nZec. 2:8 (12).-“He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye.” So\nthe primitive Hebrew text read, but was altered by the Sopherim to “his\neye.” See Appendix E.\n\nEyes are used of God’s observation.\nPsa. 11:4.-“His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men”: i.e.,\nthe Lord observeth and noteth and understandeth the acts and ways\nof men. See Job. 34:21 : “His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he\nseeth all his goings.” So Isa. 1:16. Heb. 4:13.\nHos. 13:14.-“Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes”: i.e., | will not\nrepent. So Rom. 11:29.\n\nHence the phrase to “hide from one’s eyes” means not to look\nupon or regard. See Isa. 65:16. Amo. 9:3.\n\nEyes are used of God’s grace and favour.\n\nDeu. 11:12.-\"The eyes of the Jehovah thy God, are always upon it”:\ni.e., regarding the Land with Divine benevolence. So 1Ki. 9:3. 2Ch.\n16:9.\nPsa. 32:8.-A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] : “I will guide thee with mine eye.” Π.Ν. [Note: The\nRevised Version, 1881.] : “I will counsel thee with mine eye upon\nthee.” Lit, | cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee: i.e., | will\ncause My Spirit to graciously to inform thee and lead thee in the right\nway. (See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )\n\nSo 1Ре. 3:12. See above.\n\nHence the phrases, “Mine eye spared them” (Eze. 20:17): i.e., |\nwas propitious toward them, and showed them My favour. So Eze.\n5:11; Eze. 7:4.\n“lam cut off from before thine eyes” (Psa. 31:22): 18., | have lost\nThy favour.\n\n“To keep as the apple of the eye” (Deu. 32:10).\n\nEars are attributed to God.\n\nPsa. 10:17.-“Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.”\nPsa. 31:2 (3).-“Bow down thine ear to me.”\nPsa. 40:6 (7).-“Mine ears hast thou opened or bored”: i.e., Christ says,\n“A servant for ever hast thou made me.” See margin, and compare\nExo. 21:6 and Deu. 15:17; and see under Metonymy.\nPsa. 55:1 (2).-“Give ear to my prayer, O God.”\nPsa. 71:2.-“Incline thine ear unto me and save me.”\nPsa. 130:2.-“Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the\nvoice of my supplications.”\nEze. 8:18.-“Though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will |\nnot hear them.”\nJam. 5:4.-“The cries of them which have reaped are entered into the\nears of the Lord of sabaoth.”\nSee also Isa. 50:4-5, where Messiah speaks.\nNostrils are attributed to God.\nExo. 15:8.-“With the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered\ntogether.”\nJob. 4:9.-“By the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.”\n\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] margin says “That is, by his anger,” as Isa.\n30:33. See Exo. 15:8.\n\nDeu. 33:10.-“They shall put (or let them put) incense to thy nose.” A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “before thee.”\n(But see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )\n\nPsa. 18:15.-“At the blast of the breath of thy nostril.”\nEze. 8:17.-“Lo, they put the branch (the Asherah) to my nose.” So the\nHeb. Text originally read, but was altered by the Sopherim, “to their\nnose.” See Appendix E.\n\nA Mouth and Lips and a Tongue are attributed to God, in\nconnection with His will, His word, His commands, etc.\nNum. 12:8.-“With him (Moses) will | speak mouth to mouth”: ie.,\n\nfamiliarly, and with really audible words.\nDeu. 8:3.-“By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah\ndoth man live.” So Mat. 4:4.\nJos. 9:14.-“Апа the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel\nat the mouth of the Lord.”\nJob. 11:5.-“Oh that God would speak and open his lips against thee.”\nIsa. 11:4.-“He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with\nthe breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.”\n\nThis is quoted of Christ in 2Th. 2:8.\nIsa. 30:27.-“His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a\ndevouring fire.”\nIsa. 55:11.-“So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.”\nA Voice is attributed to God.\n\nIsa. 30:30.-“Jehovah shall cause the glory of His voice to be heard”:\nie., as in AV. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,\n“his glorious voice,” thus interpreting and rendering the Hypallage (q.v.\n[Note: Which зее.] ). See Psa. 29:1-11\nArms are attributed to God, to indicate His strength and power, which\n\nin men lies so largely in the arms.\nExo. 15:16. Job. 40:9.-“Hast thou an arm like God?”\nPsa. 77:15 (16).-“Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people.” (5ο\nExo. 6:6. Deu. 9:29. Psa. 136:12).\nPsa. 79:11.-“According to the greatness of thine arm.” Here, the A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] both actually\nrender it “thy power” (marg. [Note: arg.

[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] But A.V.\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n1611.] , “with thy strong arm” (see margin).\n\nIsa. 51:9.-“Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord.” See\nalso under Epizeuxis.\n\nIsa. 59:16.-“Therefore his arm brought salvation.” So Isa. 63:5.\n\nIsa. 62:8.-“Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of\nhis strength”: i.e., by His strong arm, or, His strength.\n\nLuk. 1:51.-“He hath shewed strength with his arm.”\n\nPsa. 89:13 (14).-“Thou hast an arm with might” (see A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and\nR.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin).\n\nHere A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nboth render it “a mighty arm.”\n\nIsa. 30:30.-Jehovah “shall shew the lighting down of his arm.” Here\n\nHis voice is used of thunder, and His arm denotes His lightning.\n\nThe Arm of the Lord not only denotes power, but power executed\nin judgment.\nSee Psa. 136:12.\nThe Arm of the Lord is also used of the making known of His\ngrace in wondrous power.\n\nIsa. 52:10.-“Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all\nthe nations.” Verses 7, 8 clearly show that this was His power\nmanifested in grace to Israel.\nIsa. 53:1.-“Who hath believed our report (see Metonymy of Adjunct)?\nand to whom is the arm of Jehovah revealed?”\n\nCompare Joh. 12:38 and Rom. 1:16.\n\nA Hand is attributed to God, by which various powers and\nactions are indicated Power and Miraculous Operation.\nNum. 11:23.-“Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short?” i.e., has His power got\n\nless?

Deu. 32:40. Eze. 20:5-6; Eze. 36:7, etc. (See\nalso Gen. 14:22). This explains the difficult verse Exo. 17:16. See the\nText and margins of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,\n1881.] There is the Ellipsis of the verb which is clearly understood\nfrom the idiom, thus “Surely the hand is [lifted up] on the banner of\nJehovah.” So that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current\nText of our English Bible, 1611.] is quite correct in sense: “The Lord\nhath sworn.” (See Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, page\n382, 383).\n\n“The hand of the Lord upon” a man denoted also the power of the\nprophetic spirit.\n\n1Ki. 18:46. 2Ki. 3:15. Eze. 1:3; Eze. 8:1; Eze. 33:22.\n\nA Right Hand is attributed to God; to denote the highest power, and\nmost Divine authority.\n\nExo. 15:6; Exo. 15:12. Psa. 77:10 (11); 118:15, 16; 139:10. Isa.\n48:13.\n\nIt denotes also His grace and mercy in delivering and saving His\npeople.\nPsa. 18:35 (36); 20:6 (7) (margin); 44:3 (4); 63:8 (9); 80:15, 17 (16,\n18).\n\nIt is used also of the place accorded to Christ in His human nature\nas now exalted.\n\nPsa. 110:1. Mat. 26:64. Mar. 16:19. Act. 2:33-34; Act. 7:55-56.\nRom. 8:34. Col. 3:1, ete. Eph. 1:20-22. Heb. 1:3-4; Heb. 8:1.\n\nSo Christ dignity is further described by the figure\nTHEOPREPOS, worthy of a god. 1Co. 15:25. Eph. 4:10, ete.\n\nA Finger is attributed to God, to denote the putting forth of His\n\nformative power, and the direct and immediate act of God.\n\nExo. 8:19; Exo. 31:18. Psa. 8:3 (4). So Luk. 11:20, by which,\naccording to Mat. 12:28, the Spirit of God is meant.\nIsa. 40:12 (a span of the fingers). See 48:13.\n\nA Heart is attributed to God.\n\nGen. 6:6; Gen. 8:21. Jer. 19:5 (6). 1Sa. 13:14 : “A man after his\n\nown heart”: i.e., His own Divine and eternal purpose; having regard,\nnot to David’s worthiness or unworthiness, but to God’s own will. So\n\nAct. 13:22. See also Jer. 32:41.\n\nBowels are attributed to God; to denote His mercies and His pity.\nAll these figures of Anthropopatheia are figures of Metonomy, by\n\nwhich one thing is put for another. Here, because, when a person is\n\nmuch moved by deep feeling, there is a movement of the bowels, so\n\nthey are put, by Metonymy, for the feeling itself.\n\nIsa. 63:15.-“Where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy\n\nbowels and of thy mercies towards me?” So Jer. 31:20.\n\nLuk. 1:78.-“Through the bowels of the mercy of our God.” (See A.V.\n\n[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,\n\n1611.] margin). Here it is translated, “through the tender mercy of our\n\nGod.”\n\nMat. 9:36.-“He was moved with compassion”: /#, his bowels moved.\n\nSo Mat. 14:14; Mat. 15:32. Mar. 1:41; Mar. 6:34, etc. (See also Gen.\n\n43:30. 1Ki. 3:26. And compare this as attributed to God, Psa. 51:1 (3):\n\n“The multitude of thy tender mercies.”) So Isa. 63:7.\nA Bosom is attributed to God; to denote comfort and rest.\nPsa. 74:11 (the hand in the bosom denoting ease, according to\nPro. 19:24; Pro. 26:15).\n\nIsa. 40:11. Joh. 1:18 (“In the bosom of the Father”). Num. 11:12.\nFeet are attributed to God; to denote His presence in the earth, in\npower, in universal dominion.\n\nIsa. 66:1. Psa. 74:3; Psa. 110:1. Isa. 60:13. In this respect the\nearth is spoken of as His “footstool.”\nFootsteps are also attributed to God.\nPsa. 77:19 (20); 89:51 (52).\n\n2. Human Affections and Feelings are attributed to God\nHuman affections and feelings are attributed to God: not that He has\nsuch feelings; but, in infinite condescension, He is thus spoken of in\norder to enable us to comprehend Him.\nRejoicing is attributed to God.\nPsa. 104:31.-“The Lord shall rejoice in his works.” So Isa. 62:5. Deu.\n28:63; Deu. 30:9. Jer. 32:41, etc.\nSorrow and Grief are attributed to God.\n\nGen. 6:6.-“It grieved him at his heart.”\nJdg. 10:16.-“His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.”\nPsa. 78:40.-“How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and\ngrieve Him in the desert!”\nIsa. 63:10.-“They rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit.” So Eph. 4:30.\n\nSee Zec. 11:8. Eze. 6:9.\n\nRepentance is attributed to God.\n\nGen. 6:6.-“It repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth.”\n\nSo Exo. 32:12; Exo. 32:14. 2Sa. 24:16. Psa. 106:45. Jer. 18:8; Jer.\n26:3. Hos. 11:8. Amo. 7:3; Amo. 7:6. Joe. 2:13-14.\nAnger, Vengeance, and Hatred are attributed to God.\n\nExo. 15:7.-“Thou sentest forth thy wrath.”\nPsa. 5:5 (6).-“Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.”\nIsa. 1:14.-“Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul\nhateth.”\nIsa. 1:24.-‘l will ... avenge me of mine enemies.”\nJer. 9:9.-“Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?”\nNah. 1:2.-“God (El) is jealous, and Jehovah revengeth; the Lord\nrevengeth, and is furious: the Lord will take vengeance on his\nadversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.”\n\nSo Eze. 5:13. Psa. 2:12; Psa. 85:5 (6). Deu. 1:37; Deu. 32:16. 1Ki.\n11:9.\n\nComfort is spoken of God.\n\nIsa. 57:6.-“Should | receive comfort in these?”\nEze. 5:13.-“And | will be comforted.”\nJealousy.\n\nExo. 20:5.-“For | the Lord thy God am a jealous*{Note: |t is noteworthy\nthat Inco (kabah) out of its six occurrences, is, in five, connected\nwith ©Г (EN, God.) God (Ε).”\nNum. 25:11.-“That | consumed not the children of Israel in my\njealousy.”\nDeu. 32:16.-“They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods.” So in\nverse 21, and in 1Ki. 14:22. Isa. 9:7 (6). Eze. 8:3. Joe. 2:18.\nZec. 1:14.-“| am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great\njealousy.” See also under Polyptoton.\n\nZeal.\nIsa. 9:7 (6).-“The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”\n\nDispleasure.\n\nZec. 1:15.- am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at\nease: for | was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the\naffliction.”\nPity.\n\nJoe. 2:18.-“Then will Jehovah ... pity His People.”\n\n3. Human Actions are attributed to God.\n\nKnowing. Not actual knowledge as such, but the acquiring of\n\nknowledge as though before ignorant.\nGen. 18:21.-“I will go down now, and see whether they have done\naltogether according to the cry of it,t [Note: The Severus Codex reads\n1 for ™: ie., their cry, instead of “the cry of it.” See Ginsburg’s\nIntroduction to the Hebrew Bible, page 412.] which is come unto me;\nand if not, | will know.”\nGen. 22:12.-“Now | know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not\nwithheld thy son, thine only son from me.”\n\nGod, of course, knew it already; but, in wondrous condescension,\n\nHe stoops to make Abraham understand.\nDeu. 8:2.-“The Lord thy God led thee, etc. ... to know what was in\nthine heart.” So Deu. 13:3 (4). The Lord knew already: “For He\nknoweth the way of the righteous” (Psa. 1:6; Psa. 31:7 (8). 2Ti. 2:19).\nPsa. 14:2.-“The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of\nmen, to see (i.€., to know) if there were any that did understand,” etc.\n\nSo Psa. 53:2 (3). (See also this verse under Epanadiplosis).\n\nThe very action of our prayer to God involves an Anthropopatheia.\nGod knows all our petitions before we pray. And yet we have to pray\nas though we were making them known to Him. Php. 4:6.\n\nNot Knowing, the opposite of knowledge, is attributed to God.\nGen. 3:9.-“The Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where\nart thou?” This implies ignorance. The Lord knew; but the question is\nput to make Adam know and realise his changed condition.\nGen. 4:9.-“Where is Abel thy brother?”\n\nThese first two Divine questions in the Bible are very significant.\nSee under Erotesis.\nNum. 22:9.-“What men are these with thee?”\n1Ki. 19:9; 1Ki. 19:13.-“What doest thou here, Elijah?”\n\nSo 2Ki. 20:14-15. Isa. 39:3-4.\n\nTo this figure must be referred the passages which represent God\nas doubting, or having to wait to see certain results.\n\nEze. 20:8. Hos. 11:8-9.\n\nAlso when God tries, or proves, or searches, it is not that He does\nnot know, but that He may make others know.\nPsa. 7:9 (10).-“The righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.” (See\nMetonymy of subject).\nSo Jer. 11:20. Rev. 2:23. 1Co. 2:10.\n\nSo Christ declares that He will say:\n\nMat. 7:23 : “I never knew you”; 25:12: “I know you not.” Luk. 13:25;\nLuk. 13:27.\n\nThe questions of Christ in the New Testament are to be referred to\nthe same Figure.\nMat. 22:20.-“Whose is this image and superscription?”\n\nAlso verse 45: “If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?”\nLuk. 8:45.-“Who touched me?”\n\nRemembering.\n\nGen. 8:1.-“And God remembered Noah.” Gen. 30:22. 1Sa. 1:11; 1Sa.\n1:19.\nGen. 9:15-16, and Exo. 6:5, where God speaks of remembering His\ncovenant. So Psa. 105:8; Psa. 105:42* [Note: See the Structure of this\nPsalm in A Key to the Psalms, by the same author and publisher.] ;\n106:45: “He remembered for them His covenant,” though “they (verse\n13) soon forgat His works,” and (verse 21) “they forgat God their\nsaviour.”\n\nIt denotes specially a remembrance for good. As in Psa. 25:6-7;\nPsa. 78:39; Psa. 115:12; Psa. 119:49; Psa. 136:13. Isa. 43:25. Rev.\n18:5.\n\nExo. 2:24.-“And God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with\nIsaac, and with Jacob.” See this passage under the figures\nSynonymia, Anaphora, Polysyndeton, and Metonymy (of the Cause).\n1Sa. 1:11.-“If thou wilt ... remember me and not forget thine\nhandmaid.” See under Pleonasm.\n\n1Sa. 1:19.-“And the Lord remembered her.” There is Hypocatastasis\nhere; for it is implied that He heard Hannah’s prayer (verse 9), and did\naccording to her request.\n\nPsa. 78:39.-“Не remembered that they were but flesh.” This stands in\nsolemn contrast with verse 42: “They remembered not His hand.”\n\nPsa. 103:14.-“He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are\ndust.” This is the one thing that man will not do: he will not remember\nour infirmities. Man will remember our sins; but these are the very\nthings that God will not remember (Isa. 43:25). Infinite in power, He\nremembers our weakness. Perfect in holiness, He will not remember\nour sins.\n\nThis remembrance, though in mercy to His people, involves the\npunishment of their enemies.\n\nSee Psa. 137:7. Rev. 18:5.\n\nForgetting and Not Forgetting is also attributed to God.\n\nPsa. 9:18 (19).-“For the needy shall not alway be forgotten.”\nPsa. 13:1 (2).-“How long wilt thou forget me, O Jehovah.”\nPsa. 42:9 (10).-“I will say unto God (El) my rock, Why hast thou\nforgotten me?”\nIsa. 49:15.-“Yet will | not forget thee.”\nJer. 23:39.-“I, even I, will utterly forget you, and | will forsake you”: i.e.,\nthe false prophets, who would say “the burden of the Lord.”\nHos. 4:6.-“I will also forget thy children.” (See under Metonymy of\nCause.)\nLuk. 12:6.-“Not one of them is forgotten before God.”\nWhen God says He will not forget His enemies, it means that their\npunishment is certain, and will not be indefinitely deferred.\nJob. 11:6.-“Know therefore that God causeth to be forgotten for thee\nof thine iniquity.”\nThe A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nboth render this “God exacteth of thee /ess than thine iniquity\ndeserveth”: where two words have to be supplied through not seeing\nthe Figure, which denotes that “God (Eloah) causeth the punishment\nof thine iniquity to be deferred.” The Heb. is: “He constantly lendeth to\nthee”: i.e., crediteth thee like a lenient creditor.\n\nPsa. 74:23.-“Forget not the voice of thine enemies”: {6., do not defer\ntheir punishment.\nAmo. 8:7.-‘I will never forget any of their works”: i.e., | will surely\nremember them and punish them for them.\n\nThinking.\nGen. 50:20.-“Ye thought (i.e., devised) evil against me: but God\nthought it for good.”\nPsa. 40:5 (6).-“The thoughts which are to usward: they cannot be\nreckoned up in order unto thee.”\nPsa. 92:5 (6).-“O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are\nvery deep.”\nPsa. 139:17.-“How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God”\n(El).\nIsa. 55:8.-These words may be presented according to their structure.\n(See under Epanodos).\nа — For my thoughts are not\nb your thoughts, neither are\nЬ your ways\nа My ways, saith the Lord (Jehovah).\nJer. 29:11.-“I know the thoughts that | think toward you, saith Jehovah,\nthoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.” (See\nthis verse also under Metonymy of Adjunct and Hendiadys).\nSo Jer. 51:12; Jer. 4:28, etc.\nHissing.\nIsa. 5:26.-“He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss\nunto them from the end of the earth.” (See under Hypotyposis).\nIsa. 7:18.-“Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost parts of\nthe rivers of Egypt,” etc.\nZec. 10:8.-‘I will hiss for them; and gather them, for | have redeemed\nthem.”\n\nBreathing.\nGen. 2:7.-“The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\nsoul.”* [Note: Or “living creature,” as in chap. 1:20, 21, 24, 30.]\n\nCompare Eze. 21:31 (36), and Joh. 20:21.\n\nLaughing.\nPsa. 2:4.-“He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord\n(Adonait [Note: Or “Jehovah,” according to another reading.] ) shall\nhave them in derision.”\nPsa. 37:13.-“Adonait [Note: Or “Jehovah,” according to another\nreading.] shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.” (See\nunder Metonymy of Adjunct).\nCrying Out.\nIsa. 42:13.-“He shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his\nenemies.” And verse 14: “Now will | cry like a travailing woman.”\n\nCompare Psa. 78:65.\n\nSpeaking, by way of discourse or command.\n\nSee Gen. 1:3; Gen. 2:16; Gen. 3:9; Gen. 6:13, to Noah. Gen. 12:1;\nGen. 13:14; Gen. 15:1-21; Gen. 16:1-16; Gen. 17:1-27; Gen. 18:1-33,\nto Abraham. Exo. 3:4-5, etc., to Moses.\n\nThese instances occur so frequently that a great part of the Bible\nwould have to be transcribed if we gave them all.\n\nStanding.\nGen. 18:22.-“But the Lord stood yet before Abraham.”\n\nThis was the primitive Text; but it is one of the eighteen passages\naltered by the Sopherim to remove the harshness of the\nAnthropopatheia.

We use them now (by way of application and) by Anticipation\nor Prolepsis.

This is because, when the Lord does\nactually reign, as here described, all will be holy.

And it is written in Isa. 23:18 : “Her\nmerchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord.”\n\nThis is why also, the four living creatures who call for judgments\n(Rev. 6:1-17) which shall issue in the Lord’s reign on earth, do so with\nthe three-fold cry of these three Psalms. “Holy, holy, holy” (Rev. 4:8).\n\nThis is why their cry is foretold in Isa. 6:3 in connection with\nAdonai upon his “throne, high and lifted up” (verse 1).\n\nThe songs and words of the Apocalypse, though then (and for the\nmost part, if not all, now) future, are spoken of as present.

Here the present comes in between the past (“thou hast\ndelivered my soul from death”) and the future (“that | may walk before\nGod in the light of the living.”\n\n“These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for\nthee? [Every one]. Desolation and destruction, and the famine, and\nthe sword: by whom shall | comfort thee?” (Isa. 51:19): ie., by every\none.\n\n“Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will\nnot straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?” (Luk. 14:5). [No\none].\n\n2. In Negative Affirmation\nWhere the question is put in the negative form, and the answer must\nbe in the affirmative, and very emphatically so; the truth being thus\nmuch more forcibly brought out by the question than by a mere cold\nand formal statement of the fact.\n“Is not the whole land before thee?” (Gen. 13:9): i.e., yes, it is.\n“Do not thy brethren feed in Shechem?” (Gen. 37:13). [Yes, they\ndo.] Here, in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our\nEnglish Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,\nthe words “the flock” are inserted (in the latter not in italics). This is\nbecause of the words “their father’s flock,” which occur in the previous\nverse. But this is one of the fifteen dotted words in the Hebrew Text,\nwhich means that they had got into the Text at a very early date; and\nthe scribes, not liking actually to remove them from the Text, put a row\nof small dots along the top to show that the word or words ought not to\nbe in the Text, though they had not been taken out. As the words “the\nflock” are dotted in the Hebrew, verse 12, means that they had gone to\nfeed themselves in Shechem! (Compare Eze. 34:2; Eze. 34:8; Eze.\n34:10, and Isa. 56:11-12).\n\n“Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother, whom | know to be eloquent?”\n(Exo. 4:14): ie., | know that he is so.\n\n“Are they not on the other side Jordan?” etc. (Deu. 11:30).\n\n“Shall | not seek rest for thee?” etc. (Rth. 3:1).\n\n“Is it not | that commanded the people to be numbered?” (1Ch.\n21:17; compare 2Sa. 24:17).\n“Is there not a warfare to man upon the earth?” (Job. 7:1, R.V.\n[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ); marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , a\ntime of service. (See the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or\ncurrent Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin).\n\n“Do not all go to one place?” (i.e., to Sheol, or the grave) (Ecc.\n6:6). The answer is: Yes, they do!\n\n“Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have | no\npower to deliver?” (Isa. 50:2). Here, we have a combined affirmative\nand negative:-No; my hand is not shortened. | can redeem; and, |\nhave power to deliver. Compare 59:1.\n\n“Do not | fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:24). Yes.\nThe previous question is positive.\n\n“Is not the meat cut off before our eyes?” (Joe. 1:16).\n\n“Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the Lord” (Amo.\n2:11).\n\n“Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light?” (Amo.\n5:20). See under Metonymy and Pleonasm.\n\n“Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name\nhave cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?”\n(Mat. 7:22). See under Epizeuxis.\n\n“Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures,\nneither the power of God?” (Mar. 12:24). Here, the “not” is µή (mee)\nwhich denies subjectively, and implies not merely negative ignorance,\nbut positive unwillingness to know the Scriptures. See Mat. 22:29.\n\n“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of\nthe blood of Christ?” (1Co. 10:16). Yes, it is the fellowship of the\nmembers of the one Body in partaking of all the merits of Christ’s\nblood. “The bread which we break, is it not the communion (or\nfellowship) of the Body of Christ?”\n\nThe next verse makes it perfectly clear that the Body here\nmentioned is Christ Mystical, because the Holy Spirit goes on to give\nthe reason-“For we being many are one bread, and, one Body.” See\n1Co. 12:12.\n\n“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them\nwho shall be heirs of salvation?” (Heb. 1:14).\n\nSo Oba. 1:5; Oba. 1:8. Jon. 4:11. Joh. 4:35; Joh. 6:70; Joh. 11:9.\nSometimes the negative is omitted by Ellipsis (q.v. [Note: Which зее.]\n).\n2Sa. 15:27 -“The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou а\nseer?”\nHere the negative is supplied in italics. But not in\nEze. 8:6.-“Son of man, seest thou what they do?”: i.e., seest thou not?\nSo 1Sa. 2:27, and especially Jer. 31:20, where it should be “/s not\nEphraim my dear son? /s he not a pleasant child?” as is clear from\nwhat follows.\n\n3. In Affirmative Negation\nThis is a very important division, because some of the weightiest\ntruths are conveyed by this form of question: i.e., where the question\nis put in the affirmative, and the answer to be supplied by the mind is a\nvery emphatic negative.\n\n“Is anything too hard for the Lord?” (Gen. 18:14). No! there is\nnothing too hard for Him, for compare Jer. 32:17. Zec. 8:6. Mat. 3:9;\nMat. 19:26. Luk. 1:37.\n\n“Shall | hide from Abraham that thing which | do?” (Gen. 18:17).\n\n“How can | dispossess them?” (Deu. 7:17): i.e., | cannot do it.\n\n“Who is like unto thee?” is the cry of all the “poor and needy” ones\nwhom Jehovah has delivered. (Psa. 35:10). See Exo. 15:11. Deu.\n33:26-27. 1Sa. 2:2. Psa. 71:19; Psa. 73:25; Psa. 89:6 (7); 113:5.\n\n“Shall they escape by iniquity?” (Psa. 56:7 (8)). No, they shall not.\n“Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up\nfor me against the workers of iniquity?” (Psa. 94:16): i.e., there is no\none to do this but God; as verse 17 clearly shows.\n\n“Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all\nhis praise?” (Psa. 106:2). The answer is that no one can.\n\nPsa. 9:14 (15) does not conflict with this: for there it is a prayer for\nJehovah\'s mercy, so that he “may show forth” all His praise. Compare\nPsa. 40:5 (6); 139:17, 18.\n\nEcc. 3:21.-Here, we must take the question “who know ...\nwhether,” etc., as requiring a negative answer. See under Appendix E.\n\n“Can any hide himself in secret places that | shall not see him?\nsaith the Lord” (Jer. 23:24). No, none can so hide. The following\nquestion is negative.\n\n“How shall then his kingdom stand?” (Mat. 12:26): ie., it is\nimpossible.\n\n“Which of you convicteth me of sin?” (Joh. 8:46). ἐλέγχω\n(elengcho) does not mean to convince, but to convict by bringing in\nguilty, lay bare, expose. No one could ever bring Christ in guilty of sin.\nThis explains Joh. 16:8. See Prosapodosis.\n\n“What if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith\nof God without effect?” (Rom. 3:3). See under Tapeinosis.\n\n“If God be for us, who can be against us?”\n\n“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God\'s elect?”\n\n“Who is he that condemneth?”\n\n“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” (Rom. 8:31-35).\nSee under Epistrophe, Anaphora, Ellipsis, which are all employed in\nthese verses.\n\n“Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his\ncounsellor? Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be\nrecompensed unto him again?” (Rom. 11:34-35).\n\n“Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?” etc. (1Co.\n9:7).\n\n“Unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son?”\n(Heb. 1:5): /е., to none of them, but to the Son only. These words,\n“Thou art my Son,” appear to be the Divine formula for the anointing of\nChrist: Mat. 3:17, for His office of prophet; Mat. 17:5, for His office of\npriest, * [Note: See Christ’s Prophetic Teaching, by the same author\nand publisher.] and Psa. 2:7 (cf. Heb. 1:5), for His office of king.\n\n“To which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand,\nuntil | make thine enemies thy footstool?” (Heb. 1:13), ie., He never\nsaid this to any created angelic being.\n\nSee, for other instances, Gen. 50:19. 1Sa. 2:25. Job. 40:2, etc.\nIsa. 40:13-14. Joe. 1:2, etc., and many other places.\n\nSometimes the negative in the answer is not absolute, but only\n\nrelative.\n\n“Who knoweth the power of thine anger?” (Psa. 90:11). Not every\none. See verses 13 and 16.\n\nSee also under Metonymy.\n“Who can find a virtuous woman?” (Pro. 31:10): /е., not that there\nare absolutely none, but that they are relatively few. See the structure\nunder Acrostichion.\n\n“Who hath believed our report?” (Isa. 53:1). Not, no one, but those\nto whom it is given-the Remnant. See under Hypotyposis and\nMetonymy.\n\n“Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and\nhe shall know them?” (Hos. 14:9 (10)): .e., not that no one is wise, but\nthat such are relatively few.\n\n4. In Demonstration\nSometimes a question is used to make an affirmation as to a certain\nsubject, demonstrating a fact or proving a truth.\n\n“What man is he that feareth the Lord?” (Psa. 25:12). This is to call\nattention to the demonstration in the next verse.\n\n“Son of man, seest thou [ποῇ what they do?” (Eze. 8:6). We have\nalready had this trader a negative affirmation, but its object was to say,\nBehold, thou art a witness of their abominable idolatry.\n“What went ye out into the wilderness to see?” This question is\nthree times repeated: to demonstrate to the People the greatness of\nJohn the Baptist (Mat. 11:7-9).\n\nSo Psa. 34:12-13 (13, 14). Jer. 9:12 (11). Hos. 14:9 (10) might also\nbe put under this head. Pro. 22:29; Pro. 29:20.\n\n5. In Wonder and Admirationg\n“Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? And shall\nSarah, that is ninety years old, bear?” (Gen. 17:17), in wonder at the\nDivine power. See Rom. 4:17-21. Abraham laughed for joy, for he fell\nupon his face in reverence (Joh. 8:56. Gen. 21:8). Sarah laughed from\nincredulity (18:12). Contrast Martha and Mary in Joh. 11:21 and Joh.\n11:32. Mary “fell down at his feet.”\n\n“How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?” (Gen. 27:20).\n\n“What is this that God hath done unto us?” (Gen. 42:28).\n\n“How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in\nunity!” (Psa. 133:1). See under Asterismos.\n\n“Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from\nBozrah?” (Isa. 43:1-2). See under Prosopopeoeia.\n\nThis refers not to Christ’s work of redemption for His People, but to\nthe day of His vengeance and judgment on His enemies; as the\ncontext clearly shows.\n\n“How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah)?”\n(Eze. 16:30).\n\n“How soon is the fig-tree withered away?” (Mat. 21:20). Or better-\nHow can the fig-tree have withered by this time?\n\nSo also Mar. 6:37.\n\nSee also 1Sa. 9:21. Hab. 3:8.\n\n6. In Rapture or Exultation\n“Oh how great is thy goodness!” (Psa. 31:19 (20)).\n\n“How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, О God (El)! How\ngreat is the sum of them!” (Psa. 139:17). See Anthropopatheia.\n\n“What is man, that thou art mindful of him?” (Psa. 8:4 (5); 144:3.\nJob. 7:17. Heb. 2:6), to magnify the grace of God in lifting up such an\none from the dunghill to make him inherit the throne of glory (1Sa.\n2:8). See Psa. 113:7-8.\n\n“Who am I, O Lord God (Adoani Jehovah)?” (2Sa. 7:18).\n\nIt was the revelation of the greatness of God’s grace that enabled\nDavid thus to take the place of a true worshipper. In verse 1, David\n“sat in his house,” and before himself; then his thought was to build a\nhouse for God; but, when he learnt that God was going to build him a\nhouse, then he went in, and “sat before the Lord.”\n“Is this the manner of man, O Lord God (Adonai Jehovah)?” (2Sa.\n7:19). The margin of the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]\nreads “Is this the law of man, О Lord God,” and the A.V. [Note: The\nAuthorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin\nsays, “Heb. /aw.” But idiomatically it means, “Is this the law for\nhumanity?”: i.e., the promise to David embraced blessing for the\nwhole of humanity, and David by faith saw it, and exulted in it.\n\n7. In Wishes\n“Who will give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is\nby the gate?” (2Sa. 23:15, Heb.). See under Conismos.\n\n“Whom shall | send, and who will go for us?” (Isa. 6:8).\n\n“Who shall deliver me from this body of death?” (Rom. 7:24 (marg.\n{Note: arg. Margin.] )). See under Ecphonesis, Metonymy, Hypallage,\nand Ellipsis. By these figures is this height of Christian experience\nemphasised: i.e., the knowledge of the fact as to what God had done\nwith “sins” (Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom. 4:1-25;\nRom. 5:1-11), and also as to what He had done with “sin” (5:12-8:39);\nso that, although the fruits of the old tree are still seen and mourned\nover, there is the blessed knowledge that God reckons it as dead-as\nhaving died with Christ, and that we are to reckon the same.\n\n8. In Refusals and Denials\n“How shall | curse, whom God (EL) hath not cursed? or how shall |\ndefy, whom the Lord (Jehovah) hath not defied?” (Num. 23:8): i.e., |\nneither can nor dare do so.\n\n“What have | to do with thee?” (Joh. 2:4). See under Idiom. Also\nJdg. 11:12. 2Sa. 16:10. 1Ki. 17:18. 2Ki. 3:13. Mat. 8:29. Mar. 5:7. Luk.\n8:28.\n\n9. In Doubts\n“Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After | am waxen old\nshall | have pleasure?” (Gen. 18:12). See above.\n\n“O Ephraim, what shall | do unto thee? O Judah, what shall | do\nunto thee?” (Hos. 6:4). See under Aporia. So Hos. 11:8.\n\n“Wherewith shall | come before the Lord, and bow myself before\nthe high God?” (Mic. 7:6).\n“But the righteousness which is of faith, speaketh on this wise, Say\nnot in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?” (Rom. 10:6-7). See\nunder Epitrechon. These doubts, raised by self-righteousness, are\nseen to be removed only by the imputation of a Divine righteousness.\n\n10. In Admonition\n“Hearest thou not, my daughter?” (Rth. 2:8): ie., diligently hearken.\n“Go not to glean in another field.”\n\n“Who hath warned you (with the emphasis on the “you”) to flee\n\nfrom the wrath to come?” (Mat. 3:7).\n\n11. In Expostulation\n“Where art thou?” (Gen. 3:9). To show Adam where he really was, and\nthe condition into which he had fallen, having lost fellowship and\ncommunion with God.\n\n“What is this that thou hast done unto me?” etc. (Gen. 12:18-19).\n\n“What is that betwixt me and thee?” (Gen. 23:15).\n“Who am | that | should go into Pharaoh?” (Exo. 3:11).\n\n“What could have been done more to my vineyard, that | have not\ndone in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,\nbrought it forth wild grapes?” (Isa. 5:4).\n\n“Wherefore, have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?\nwherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?”\n(Isa. 58:3).\n\nSo Gen. 31:26-27; Gen. 44:4; Gen. 44:15. Psa. 11:1; Psa. 50:16\n(see Apodioxis). Eze. 12:22; Eze. 18:1 (2). Dan. 3:14; and many\nexamples in the prophecy of Malachi.\n\n12. In Prohibitions\n“Why should | be deprived also of you both in one day?” (Gen. 27:45).\n\n“Why should | kill thee?” (1Sa. 19:17): i.e., let me not have to kill\nthee.\n\n“Wherefore should the heathen say,” etc.? (Psa. 79:10): i.e., let not\nthe heathen say.\n“Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the\nwork of thine hands?” (Ecc. 5:6).\n\n“Why shouldest thou die before thy time?” (Ecc. 7:17).\n\n“Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword?” (Jer. 27:13).\nSo verse 17, “Wherefore should this city be laid waste?” i.e., Do not\ndie. Do not let this city be laid waste.\n\n“Why will ye die, О house of Israel?” (Eze. 33:11): /е., Turn from\nyour ways, so that ye die not. See under Epizeuxis and Obtestatio.\n\nSo 2Sa. 2:22. 2Ch. 25:16. Dan. 1:10, etc.\n\n13. In Pity and Commiseration\n\n“How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people?” (Lam. 1:1; see\n2:1, etc.). See under Antithesis and Ellipsis.\n\n“How often would | have gathered thy children, etc.?” (Mat. 23:37).\n\nThere are many examples in the Book of Lamentations.\n14. In Disparagements\n“Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he\nto be accounted of?” (Isa. 2:22).\n“What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?”\n(Ki. 9:13).\n15. In Reproaches\n“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying,\nWhat is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto them, What\nburden? | will even forsake you, saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:33. So Jer.\n23:35-36).\n“What is truth?” (Joh. 18:38). See /rony.\n16. In Lamentation\n“Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!” (Psa. 3:1 (2)): i.e., how\ncome mine enemies to be so many?\n“Why hast thou forsaken me?” (Psa. 22:1 (2)).\n“Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?\nIs his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?\nHath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his\ntender mercies?” (Psa. 77:7-9 (8-10)). These lamentations arise from\nself-occupation (see verses 1-6). It is our natural “infirmity” (verse 10),\nthat leads us into it. The only remedy is to cease from self-occupation,\nand look away from ourselves to God (verses 10-20): then happiness\nand praise take the place of lamentation.\n\nCompare Psa. 73:1-28; where the same experience is gone\nthrough, only then the trouble arises from looking around instead of\nlooking within. But the remedy for this “foolishness” (verse 22) is the\nsame as for the “infirmity”: viz., looking up (verses 17 and 23-28).\n\nThe lesson from questions in these two Psalms (Ixxvii. and Ixxiii.)\nis this. If we want to be miserable, all we have to do is to look within. If\nwe want to be distracted, all we have to do is to look around. But if we\nwould be happy, we must look up, away from ourselves and others, to\nGod.* [Note: See Things to Come for Oct., 1899.]\n\n“How is the faithful city become an harlot!” (Isa. 1:21). Or, “How is\nit that the loyal city has turned harlot?” See under Synecdoche and\nAntithesis.\n“Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? Shall\nthe priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?”\n(Lam. 2:20).\n\n17. In Indignation\n“Why do the heathen rage? and [why do] the people imagine a vain\nthing?” (Psa. 2:1).\n\n“How long shall | be with you? How long shall | suffer you?” (Mat.\n17:17). See Ecphonesis.\n\n18. In Absurdities and Impossibilities\n“Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?” (Job. 14:4).\n\n“Shall mortal man be more just than God? or shall a man be more\npure than His Maker?” (Job. 4:17).\n\n“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then\nmay ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil” (Jer. 13:23). See\nParoemia.\n“How can a man be born when he is old?” etc. (Joh. 3:4).\n“How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” (Joh. 6:52). It was “a\nhard saying” (verse 60), and hence they thought it absurd.\n“Have any of the elders or of the Pharisees believed on him?”\n(Joh. 7:48). This question forms, from that day to this, the excuse for\nnot acknowledging the claims of God or His Truth, unless the great\nand the influential of the Church receive them. It is the putting of man\nbefore God, instead of studying to show ourselves approved only to\nGod.\n\n“Who is this Son of man?” (Joh. 12:34). This was the expression of\nthe absurdity on the part of Christ\'s enemies.\n\n19. Double Questions\nSometimes double questions are employed, repeating the same\nquestion in different words so as to express the fact more\nemphatically.\n\nSee Job. 4:17; Job. 6:5, etc.; 8:3; 10:4, etc.; 11:2, 7; 22:3.

This that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the\ngreatness of his strength?\n| that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.\nWherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that\ntreadeth in the winefat?\n| have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there\nwas none with me; for | will tread them in mine anger, and\ntrample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled\nupon my garments, and | will stain all my raiment. For the day\nof vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is\ncome.” etc.\nThus, vividly and powerfully, is the day of vengeance, and of\njudgment, described. And yet there are persons who take this\npassage as treating of Christ’s past work of grace on Calvary!\nMic. 2:4.-“In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and\nlament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled:” etc.\n(See under Polyptoton).\n\nZec. 8:20-23.-It shall yet come to pass that there shall come people,\nand the inhabitants of many cities: And the inhabitants of one city shall\ngo to another, saying,\n\nLet us go speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the\n\nLord of hosts: | will go also.\n\nYea, many people and strong nations shall come,” etc. See\nPolyptoton.\n\nSome think that Paul, when he says, in\n1Co. 9:24, “So run, that ye may obtain,” does not directly exhort the\nCorinthians himself; but by a Sermocinatio, brings forward and uses\nthat incitement which the trainers and spectators in the public contests\nusually employed.\n\nOther examples may be found under Antimetathesis, and in Mat.\n25:37-39.

She admitted the fact\nas to her condition as “a dog of the Gentiles,” and said, “Truth, Lord:”\nand received the blessing which had been determined for her.\nMat. 21:29 is sometimes given as an example; but this was a real\nrefusal, altered by after repentance.',''),(189,189,'tiologia','Rom. 1:13.-Νονν | would not have you ignorant, brethren, that\noftentimes | purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that |\nmight have some fruit among you also, even as among other\nGentiles.”\n\nVerses 15, 16: “l am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at\nRome also.

It depends entirely on what the religion\nis, whether true or false.\n\nThere are only two religions in the world; and there never have\nbeen more from Gen. 4:1-26 to the present day. They are put in the\nforefront of Revelation. Abel\'s and Cain’s; God’s way and man’s way;\nGod’s way, and man’s attempted improvement on it.\n\nAll kinds of false religion agree in one thing.
