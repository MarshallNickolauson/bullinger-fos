Protimesis; or, Description of Order

Pro’-ti-mee’-sis (προήµησις), a putting of one thing before another:
from ττρό (pro), before, and τιµή (timee), honour. Hence, the figure is
employed when things are enumerated according to their places of
honour or importance, using the particles “first,” “again,” “then,” or
“firstly,” “secondly,” “thirdly,” etc.

This figure; therefore, increases the emphasis of a particular
statement by setting forth the order in which the things treated of
stand, or take place.
