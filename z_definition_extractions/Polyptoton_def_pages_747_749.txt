Polyptoton; or, Many Inflections

The Repetition of the same Part of Speech in different Inflections
Po-lypr-tep-ton. Greek, πολύττωτον; from πολύς (ро!ы5), many, and
TITWOIC (ptqsis), a falling: in grammar, a case (from an assumed form
πτόω, ρίοφ, to fall). Hence, Polyptoton means with many cases, {8., a
repetition of the same noun in several cases, or of the same verb in
several moods or tenses. With many inflections is a definition which
covers both nouns and verbs.

It is called also METAGOGE (met-a-gqb-gee). Greek μεταγωγή,
from µετά (meta), a change, and Gyw (адф), to lead. It means а
change of course; a different arrangement of the same word, a leading
of the same word through different inflections.

In Latin it is called CASUUM VARIETAS, a variety of cases.

This figure, therefore, is a repetition of the same word in the same
sense, but not in the same form: from the same root, but in some
other termination; as that of case, mood, tense, person, degree,
number, gender, etc.

By “case,” etc., is to be understood not merely the case of nouns,
but inflections of all kinds.
