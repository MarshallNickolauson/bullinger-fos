Maledictio; or, Imprecation

Expression of Feeling by way of Malediction or Execration

Mal’-e-dic’-ti-o. This is the Latin name, and means denunciation,
cursing, imprecation, or execration.

Hence the other Latin names, IMPRECATIO and EXECRATIO,
COMMINATIO. Also ARA, an altar, by which, and at which, oaths and
execrations were pronounced.

The Greeks called it APEUCHE, ap-eu-chee, from ἀπεύχομαι, to
pray a thing away, to pray that a thing may not be, and MISOS, mi-
sos, Greek µῖσος, hate, hatred, a hateful object or thing.
