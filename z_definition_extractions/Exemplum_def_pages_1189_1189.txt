Exemplum; or, Example

Addition of Conclusion by way of Example

This is not the same as using examples in the course of argument. We
do this latter when in any reasoning we adduce one known object or
thing as a sample of another in respect to some particular point.

Exemplum, on the other hand, is when we conclude a sentence by
employing an example as a precedent to be followed or avoided.
