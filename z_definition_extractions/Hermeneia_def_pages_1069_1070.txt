Hermeneia; or, Interpretation

Repetition for the Purpose of Interpreting what has been already said

Her-mee’-neia, ἑρμηνεία, interpretation, explanation. This figure is so-
called because, after a particular statement the explanation follows
immediately to make more clear what has been said less clearly.

The Latins consequently called it INTERPRETATIO, or
Interpretation.
