Eironeia; or, IRONY

The Expression of Thought in a form that naturally conveys its
opposite

Г-гоп-у. Greek, εἰρωνεία (eiréneia), dissimulation. Hence, a
dissembling, especially in speech, from εἴρειν (εἰπείπ), to speak.

The figure is so called when the speaker intends to convey a
sense contrary to the strict signification of the words employed: not
with the intention of concealing his real meaning, but for the purpose
of adding greater force to it. There are not many examples of this
figure in Scripture. /rony has too much of contempt in it to suit the pity
which is rather the spirit of the Scriptures.

And, moreover, /rony in the Scriptures is generally connected with
serious words which make its use perfectly patent and clear.

There are three classes of /гопу:-

1. ANTIPHRASIS, an-tiph’-rasis, from avti (anti), against or
opposite, and φράσις (phrasis), a way of speaking (from φράζειν,
phrazein, to speak). This name is given to /rony when it consists of
one word or a single expression. As when “a court of justice” is called
“a court of vengeance.”

2. PERMUTATIO or permutation, when the /rony consists of
phrases, and sentences, or longer expressions.

3. SARCASMOS, §sar-cas-mos. Greek, σαρκασµός; (Latin,
sarcasmos), from σαρκάζω (sarkaz6), to tear flesh as dogs do; hence,
a rending or tearing or wounding with cutting words; sarcasm. /rony is
so called when it is used as a taunt or in ridicule.

We have not arranged our examples in these three divisions, but
have combined these together in five other divisions more simply,
thus:-

I. Divine Irony. Where the speaker is Divine.

II. Human Irony. Where the speaker is a human being.

III. Peirastic Irony. Where the words are not spoken ironically in
the ordinary sense, but peirastically: i.e., by way of trying or
testing (PEIRASTIKOS).

IV. Simulated Irony. Where the words are used by man in
dissimulation or hypocrisy.

V. Deceptive Irony. Where the words are not only hypocritical, but
false and deceptive.
