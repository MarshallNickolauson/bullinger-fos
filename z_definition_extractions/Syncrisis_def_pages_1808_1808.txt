Syncrisis; or, Repeated Simile

Repetition of a number of Resemblances

Syn~-cri-sis. Greek, σύγκρισις, from σύν (sun), together with, and
κρίσις (crisis), a judging or deciding.

Hence, Syncrisis is the judging or comparing of one thing with
another; and is used of the figure which consists of a repeated Simile,
or of more than one, or of a number of separate comparisons used
together.

Another name for this figure is PARATHESIS (Pa-rath’-e-sis),
Greek, παράθεσις, a putting beside; from παρά (para), beside, and
τιθέναι (tithenai), to place.

It was called by the Latins COMPARATIO: i.e., a bringing together
and comparing.
