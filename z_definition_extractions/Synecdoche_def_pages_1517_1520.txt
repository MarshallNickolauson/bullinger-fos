Synecdoché; or, Transfer

The exchange of one idea for another associated idea

Syn-ek’-do-kee. Greek, συνεκδοχή, from σύν (sun), together with, and
ἐκδοχή, a receiving from. A figure by which one word receives
something from another which is internally associated with it by the
connection of two ideas: as when a part of a thing is put by a kind of
Metonymy for the whole of it, or the whole for a part. The difference
between Metonymy and Synecdoché lies in this; that in Metonymy, the
exchange is made between two related nouns; while in Synecdoché,
the exchange is made between two associated ideas.

Synecdoché of the Genus is where the genus is put for a species.
Synecdoché of the Species is where a species is put for the
genus.
Synecdoché of the Whole is where the whole is put for a part: and
Synecdoché of the Part is where a part is put for the whole.
