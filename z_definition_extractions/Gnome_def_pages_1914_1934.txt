Gnome; or, Quotation

6Πό΄-ππεθ. Greek, γνώµη, knowledge, understanding; also a means of
knowing. From γνῶναι (gnénai), to know.

Hence, the term Gnome is given to the citation of brief,
sententious, profitable sayings expressive of a universal maxim or
sentiment which appertains to human affairs, cited as well-known, or
as being of general acceptance, but without quoting the author’s
name.

In Pro. 1:2, they are called “words of understanding.” The
Scriptures, as Bengel remarks, are so “full of the best things, that
these constitute, as it were, certain continued sentiments openly set
forth in the form of gnomes.”

When these are applied to a certain person, time, or place; or to
individual cases; or are clothed with circumstantial particulars, the
figure is called NOEMA, vonua (no-ee-ma), (plural, NOEMATA), {9.,
sense, thought, that which is thought, from νοεῖν, to perceive.

When the author’s name is given, the figure is called CHREIA,
xpeia, chree’-a, use, usage, or usance, (from χράοµαι, chraomai, to
use).
For the Greek name of the figure Gnome the Latins substituted
SENTENTIA (sen-ten-ti-a), sentiment, or a sententious saying; a
philosophic aphorism, maxim, or axiom, which is quoted on account of
its application to the subject in hand.
These are exactly what are referred to in Ecc. 12:11.
“The words of the wise
Are as goads;
And as tent-pegs well fixed are

[The words] of the masters of assemblies.* [Note: See under
Ellipsis, page 74.]

A Gnome, however, differs from a Proverb in this: that every
Proverb is a Gnome, but every Gnome is not necessarily a Proverb. A
Gnome is, properly speaking, a quotation: and therefore this figure
opens up the whole question of the Quotations from the Old
Testament in the New.

This is a large subject, many volumes having been written upon it,
both in ancient and in recent times.
It is also a difficult subject, owing to certain phenomena which lie
upon its surface.

It is a fact that there are variations between the quotations and the
Text quoted from.

Sometimes they agree with the Septuagint translation, and differ
from the Hebrew, and vice versa; and sometimes they differ from both.

Sometimes they are direct quotations; at other times they are
composite quotations of several passages joined in one; while others
are mere allusions.

Consequently it is difficult for anyone to make a list or table of such
quotations which shall agree with those made by others.
The general fact seems to be that there are 189 separate
passages quoted* [Note: If it is merely a reference or allusion, as
distinct from a quotation, then there are many more, of course. The
Lord Jesus Himself referred to 22 out of our 39 Old Testament books.

In Matthew there are references to 88 passages in 10 Old
Testament books. In Mark to 37 passages in 10 books. In Luke to 58
passages in 8 books. In John to 40 passages in 6 books.

Deuteronomy and Isaiah, the two books most assailed by the
Higher Critics, are referred to more often than any other Old
Testament books. While Revelation contains no less than 244
references to 25 Old Testament books.

In Romans there are 74 references. Corinthians, 54. Galatians, 16.
Ephesians, 10. Hebrews, 85.

In all, out of 260 chapters in the New Testament, there are 832
quotations, or references, or allusions to the Old Testament
Scriptures.

Every Old Testament book is referred to with the exception of
Ezra, Neh. Est., and Canticles.
The Apocryphal books are not referred to at all.] in the New
Testament, according to Spearman’s reckoning:t [Note: Letters to a
friend. Edinburgh, 1759.] i.e., counting a passage only once, though it
may be quoted several times. Including the whole, there are,
according to Bishop Wetenhall’s method, 244: of which 147 agree with
the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , and 97 differ
from it.

Reckoning according to Spearman, we find, out of the 189
passages quoted, 105 that agree with the Septuagint, 21 that differ
from it, 45 that differ from both it and the Hebrew, and 18 neutral.

These may be exhibited in the following table:-

It will thus be seen that by far the larger number of quotations
correspond with the Septuagint translation.

Now, all the difficulties have been caused by thinking and speaking
only of the instrument or the agent employed: instead of having regard
to the great and important fact that the Bible has only One Author, and
that “Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost”
(2Pe. 1:21).

Our studies will certainly be incomplete if we do not observe the
manner in which the Holy Spirit quotes in the New Testament those
Scriptures which He had before inspired in the Old. Notice, then, the
following examples:-

Mar. 12:36.-“David himself said by the Holy Ghost.” This was the
introduction to a quotation from Psa. 110:1.

Mat. 15:4.-Referring to Exo. 20:12, our Lord says, “God commanded,
saying,” etc.
Heb. 3:7.-Referring to Psa. 95:7-11. “Wherefore as the Holy Ghost
saith,” not “as David saith,” or “as the Psalmist saith.”

Heb. 9:8.-Referring to Exo. 25:1-40 -х!. (concerning the Tabernacle
and its teaching), “The Holy Ghost this signifying,” etc.

Heb. 10:15.-Quoting Jer. 31:33-34, “Whereof the Holy Ghost is a
witness to us.”

Act. 1:16.-Peter, quoting Psa. 41:9 (10), says, “This Scripture must
needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of
David, spake before concerning Judas.” Observe, that while David
spake, the words were not his, but “the words of the Holy Ghost.”
Act. 3:18.-Peter, referring to the Old Testament prophecies of Christ,
says, “Those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all
his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.”

Act. 28:25.-Paul, quoting Isa. 6:9, exclaims, “Well spake the Holy
Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers.

Old Testament passages are introduced in various ways:

1. γέγρατπαι (gegraptai), it standeth written. Mat. 4:4-10. Luk. 4:4;
Luk. 4:8. Rom. 1:17; Rom. 3:4; Rom. 3:10; Rom. 10:15. 1Co. 1:19;
1Co. 1:31. 1Pe. 1:16, etc.

2. λέγει γὰρ ἡ γραφή (legei даг hee graphee), for the Scripture
saith. Rom. 9:17 (Exo. 9:16). Rom. 10:11 (Isa. 28:16). 1Ti. 5:18 (Deu.
25:4).

3. 6 νόμος (ho nomos) The Law. Joh. 15:25, from Psa. 35:19; Psa.
69:4 (5), emphasizes the fact that the Sacred Writings of the Old
Covenant, viewed as a whole, constituted the Law of Israel. The
pronoun “their” shows this. Joh. 10:34 (from Psa. 82:6) is written in
Exo. 21:6; Exo. 22:8-9 (7, 8). And 1Co. 14:21 (from Isa. 28:11-12) has
a reference to Deu. 28:49. Thus the reference is carried back, not only
to the passage quoted, but to the one still earlier, in which it had its
origin.
In the New Testament eight men are specified as the agents
employed by the Holy Spirit: Moses, 13 times; David 7; Elijah, once;
Isa. 12:1-6; Joel, once; Hosea, once; Jeremiah, twice; Daniel, once.

In Matthew an agent is named 13 times (Jeremiah, Isaiah, Moses,
David, and Daniel).

In Mar. 7:1-37 (Moses, Isaiah, David, Daniel).

In Luk. 6:1-49 (Moses, Isaiah, David).

In Joh. 4:1-54 (Isaiah, Moses).

In Act. 10:1-48 (David, Joel, Moses, Isaiah).

In Rom. 10:1-21 (David, Hosea, Isaiah, Moses, Elijah).

In 1 Cor., (Moses) once.

In Heb. 3:1-19 (David, Moses).

In Rev., (Moses) once.

Thus, 14 passages are ascribed to the agency of Moses; 8 to that
of David; 13 of Isa. 2:1-22 of Hos. 2:1-23 of Jer. 1:1-19 of Dan. 1:1-21
of Joe. 1:1-20 of Elijah.
These facts are deeply instructive; because, for example, while the
modern critics divide the book of Isaiah into two authorships, the New
Testament ascribes six out of the thirteen passages to Isaiah in the
first part of the prophecy (chaps. 1-39.), and seven out of the last part
(chaps. 40-46). The recognition of this one simple fact demolishes
completely the hypothesis of the Higher Critics, and will cause us to
prefer the statements of God to the imagination of men.

In making a quotation from the Old Testament in the New, surely
the Holy Spirit is at liberty to do what any and every human writer may
do, and frequently does, in his own works. Human writers and
speakers constantly repeat, refer to, and quote what they have
previously written and spoken, introducing the words in new senses, in
different connections, with varied references, and in fresh applications.

This is the case with the quotations in the Bible, and this one
consideration explains all the so-called difficulties connected with the
subject.

Our work, then, in considering these differences, becomes totally
different in character from that which treats them merely as
discrepancies, arising from human infirmity or ignorance. These
differences become all important, because they convey to us Divine
comments, and reveal to us new truths.
In quoting, or using again, words and expressions which the Holy
Spirit has before used, we may note the following interesting ways in
which He varies the sense or the words in order to convey to us new
truths and lessons by the new application.
In referring to these by way of illustration we have not classified
them according to these definitions and divisions, as the student can
determine each case for himself. But we have followed the
arrangement of Glassius in his chapter on Gnomes.* [Note: Which
Keach translates almost verbatim, without any acknowledgment.]

I. As to their INTERNAL form (i.e., the sense as distinct from
the words).

1. Where the sense originally intended is preserved.

2. Where the sense is modified.

3. Where the sense is accommodated (accommodatio)

II. As to their EXTERNAL form (i.e., the words as distinct from

the sense).

1. Where the words quoted are the same as the Hebrew or
the Septuagint.

2. Where the words are varied as to omission, position,
oraddition.

3. Where words are changed:
a. by areading:
b. by an inference:
c. in number:
d. in person:
е. in mood or tense.
4. Where several citations are amalgamated (composite quotations).
5. Where the quotations are made from books other than the Bible.

We will now consider these forms of Quotation in order.
