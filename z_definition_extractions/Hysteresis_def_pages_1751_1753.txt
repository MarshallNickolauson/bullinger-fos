Hysteresis; or, Subsequent Narration

A subsequent Narration of prior Events

Hys’-ter-ee-sis. Greek, ο), ποπ (hystere?), to come later.
Hence, a coming after or later-

This is a special form of Hysterologia, and does not refer to
connected records or events, but gives, long afterwards, further details
of some long prior events; or, gives events never before recorded.

When a record, written much later, gives supplemental or new
particulars, quite disconnected from the original historical record, it is
called Hysteresis: and hence has been called

HISTORICAL HYSTERESIS,
by which the Holy Spirit, in later and subsequent Scriptures, adds
supplementary details which were not given in the history itself; and
sometimes even historical facts, of which no mention had before been
made.

Man often does, and is allowed to do, this in human literature: but
God may not! and so man cavils at this beautiful figure, and sees in it
only “discrepancy”; instead of delighting in these subsequent
supplementary facts thus revealed to us by the Holy Spirit, and such
as none but He could give.
