Heterosis; or, Exchange of Accidence

Exchange of one Voice, Mood, Tense, Person, Number, Degree, or
Gender, for another

Hetr-e-rqpr-sis, ἕτερος (heteros), another, different. It 15 the name given
to that form of Enallage which consists of an exchange, not of actual

parts of speech, but of the accidence of a part of speech.

It includes an exchange of one Form of the Verb for another (e.g.,
intransitive for transitive); one Mood or Tense for another; one Person
