Tmesis; or, Mid-cut

A Change by which one Word is cut in two, and another Wordput in
between

Tm??-sis. Greek, | 2 a cutting, from |" (temnein), to cut.

It is a figure by which a compound word or connected phrase is
separated, and the position of its syllables changed, by the
intervention of one or more words.

Each of the syllables thus cut off is a separate and complete word.
Thus in “to us ward,” the word “toward” is, by the figure Tmesis, cut in
two: and the word “us” is put in between the two separated words, “to
us ward.” So also we say “to heaven ward,” or “what condition soever.”

The figure is also called DIACOPE, Di-ac’-o-pee. Greek, μα а
cutting in two.

DIRESIS, D?-??-re-sis. Greek, "(= Г! (diairesis), a dividing
through.

DIASTOLE, Di-as-to-lee. Greek, "'(Г!!=, a separating through.

ECTASIS, Ec’-ta-sis. Greek, 9 |<"), a stretching out.

DIALYSIS, Di-al’-y-sis. Greek, “=. "!, a dissolving or parting
asunder.

DIVISIO, Division.

There is an example of it in Eph. 6:8 : 5 |’ °= (ho ti ean), three
words, which usually go together in this order, are divided: and the last
is put in between the other two, so that it reads “what soever thing,”
instead of “what thing soever.”

Our English Tmesis here better expresses the Greek, than the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] which neglects the Greek Tmesis-

various readings created in order to explain it.
