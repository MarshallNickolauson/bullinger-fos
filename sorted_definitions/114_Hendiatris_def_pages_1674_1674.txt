Hendiatris; or, Three for One

Three words used, but one thing meant

Though the Greeks did not name such a figure, it is clear that it is
employed in Scripture. For we sometimes find three nouns instead of
two, and in these cases there are two nouns exalted to the place of
emphatic adjectives, which are thus raised to equal importance with
the subject itself.
