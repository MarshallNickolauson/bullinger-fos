Deasis; or, Adjuration

An Expression of Feeling by Oath or Asseveration

De’-a-sis, from Greek, δέησις, an entresting, obtestation, or calling to
witness.
The Latins called it OBSECRATIO, a beseeching, imploring, and
OBTESTATIO, an adjuring, or calling of God to witness.

The figure is used when the speaker or writer calls God or heaven
to witness to the truth of what is said, or to the facts which he states.
Apart from this calling to witness, the figure is of the nature of
Apostrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
