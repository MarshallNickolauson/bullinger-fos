Protherapeia; or, Conciliation

The securing of Indulgence for what is about to be said

Pro-ther-a-pei-a. Greek, προθεραπεία, previous care or treatment,
from πρό (pro), before, and θεραπεία (therapeia), service.

The Figure is used when, by way of precaution, we secure
indulgence, or conciliate others, with reference to something we are
about to say.

It is called also PROEPIPLEXIS, pro-ep-i-pleex’-is, from πρό
(pro), before, and ἐπίπληξις, blame, a blaming (of one’s self)
beforehand. i.e., in order to secure the attention or favour of another.

When it is added at the end of what is said, it is called
Epitherapeia (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
