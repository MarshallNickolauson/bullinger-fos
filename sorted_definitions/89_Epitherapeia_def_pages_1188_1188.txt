Epitherapeia; or, Qualification

Addition of Conclusion by way of Modification

Ep’-i-ther-a-pei‘a, from ἐπῄ (epi), upon, and θεραπεία (therapei’-a), a
waiting on, especially of medical attendance, from θεραπεύεῖν.
(therapeuein), to serve as an attendant, to tend, especially medically.

Hence, the compound Epitherapeia is used of applying an
additional remedy. And the figure is employed when a sentence is
added at the end, fo heal, soften, mitigate, or modify what has been
before said, so that modesty or other feeling might not be offended or
injured. It may be added by way of apology.

But where this is added beforehand, to secure indulgence, it is
called Protherapeia (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ); and where this is done
to prepare for a shock it is called Prodiorthosis (q.v. [Note: Which see.]).
