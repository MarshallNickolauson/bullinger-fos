Anticategoria; or, Tu Quoque

The use of a Counter-Charge, or Recrimination

An‘-ti-cat’-ee-gor’-i-a. Greek, ἀντικατηγορία, a counter-charge: from
ἀντί (anti), against, and κατηγορέω, to speak against: hence, to
recriminate, to accuse in turn.

The figure is used when we retort upon another the very
insinuation or accusation which he has made against us. It differs from
Antistrophe (see above); in that it has to do, not with any general kind
of words, but with a particular accusation.

It is what the Latins called a TU QUOQUE; or, ACCUSATIO
ADVERSA, an opposite accusation, or an accusation turned against
another; or, TRANSLATIO IN ADVERSARIUM, a transferring against
an adversary.
