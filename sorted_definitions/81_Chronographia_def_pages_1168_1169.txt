Chronographia; or, Description of Time

Chron’-o-graph -i-a, from Χρόνος (chronos), time, and γράφεῖν
(graphein), to write. 

It is called by the Latins, TEMPORIS
DESCRIPTIO, a description of the time.

The Figure is used, when, by the addition of the time, something
explanatory is given which helps to the understanding of what is said;
or, supplies some important fact; or, implies some extra lesson.

All such expressions, as “then” or “at that time,” should be noticed;
and attention should be directed to the time to see when it was, and
why the particular time should have been thus described or referred
to.
