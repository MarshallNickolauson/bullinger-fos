Amphidiorthosis; or, Double Correction

A setting both Hearer and Speaker right by a Correction which acts
both ways

Am -phi-di-or-th6-sis. From ἁμφί (amphi), about, on both sides, διά
(dia), through, and ἀρθοῦν (orthoun), to set straight (from ἀρθός
(orthos), straight).

The figure is so called because, like the former Figure,
Epanorthosis, it is a recalling or correction of what has been said, yet
not merely with reference to the meaning of the speaker, but also as to
the feeling of the hearer. So that the correction is on both sides. When
this, or rather a similar figure, is used in Argumentation, it is called
Prodiorthosis; and in Prodiorthosis it is not so much are calling, so that
there may be no shock at all (as in Amphidiorthosis), but a preparing
for a shock that does actually come.

Some have confounded these two figures, but this is the distinction
between them.
