Hyperbole; or, Exaggeration

When more is said than is literally meant

Hy-per’-bo-le is from ὑπέρ (huper or hyper), over and above, or
beyond (like Lat., super), and βολή (bolee), a casting, from βάλλειν
(ballein), to throw. Hence, a casting or going beyond, overshooting,
excess

The figure is so called because the expression adds to the sense
so much that it exaggerates it, and enlarges or diminishes it more than
is really meant in fact. Or, when more is said than is meant to be
literally understood, in order to heighten the sense.

It is the superlative degree applied to verbs and sentences and
expressions or descriptions, rather than to mere adjectives.

The figure is known by several names. It is called EPAUXESIS (Ep-аuх-ее-sis), growth or increase upon. HYPEROCHE (hy-per’-o-ch’),
excess, superabundance-HYPERTHESIS (hy-per’-the-sis), a placing
or passing beyond, superlative. № was called by the Latins
SUPERLATIO (su-per-la‘ti-o), a carrying beyond, an exaggerating.
