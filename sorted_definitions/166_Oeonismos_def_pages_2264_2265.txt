Oeonismos; or, Wishing

An Expression of Feeling by way of wishing or hoping for a thing

@’-6-nis’-mos. Greek, οἰωνισμός, a divining by the flight of birds,
divination. Then, because these diviners generally saw what they
wished to see, it came to mean a looking for, especially in the sense
of a foreboding.

The Latins named the figure OPTATIO, a hoping for, or wishing. By
this figure, what is said is changed from a plain statement to the
expressing of it as a hope, or an ardent desire, or lively anticipation,
often introduced by the words “O that,” etc. See Deu. 5:29 (26). Num.
14:2.
