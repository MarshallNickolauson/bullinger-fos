Pranismos; or, Exultation

An Expression of Feeling by calling on Others to Rejoice

Poe-an’-is-mos. Greek, παιανισµός, the chanting of the poean. The
παιάν (poean) was a term first applied to a physician, then generally of
any saviour, or deliverer. Then it was used of a song of deliverance, or
of triumph after victory, and even before it, as a war-song. Then it was
used of any solemn song of triumph.* |Мо!е: This 15 also written
Uétisésd; as the name from which it is derived is also written Uéy.
Indeed, according to the 1890 edition of Liddell and Scott, the “u” in
these words and their derivatives would seem to have been the Attic
form. Moreover, according to L. and $., Ué,, 2222232 (whence
perhaps the Attic form) was, originally, the name of “the physician of
the gods”! In this character, they tell us, “he cures the wounded
Hades and Ares” (see Hom. ΙΙ. 5:401 and 899). From him, it seems,
the name came to be applied to human physicians. After Homer, L.
and S. tell us, “the name and office of healing were transferred to
Apollo.” And from his son, Esculapius (Asclepius, in its more Greek
form), physicians got another of their titles. So, then, dé meant a
choral song, of which the main burden was 13 (contracted from Р
apparently, which would seem to be connected with НОх, 21 heal?) ог
i, 99933, sung in commemoration of deliverance from some evil-[a
pestilence, perhaps, originally]-and hence a song of triumph generally.
Such a song would be sung before as well as after battle. Thence,
again, any solemn song or chant; often sung, as an omen of success,
before an undertaking.]

So that the figure consists of a calling on others to rejoice over
something, instead of merely stating the thing as a matter of fact; thus
emphasizing and calling attention to it.
