Hypotimesis; or, Under-Estimating

Parenthetic Addition by way of Apology or Excuse

Hy-po-ti-mee’-sis (ὑποτίμησις), from ὑπτό (hypo), under, and ήµησις
(timeesis), a valuing, or estimating, from τιμάω (tima?), to deem, or
hold worthy. Hence, an under-estimating, under-valuing.

A parenthetical remark is so called when it is apologetic, in order
to excuse some bold or extravagant use of language, such as “If | may
so say,” or “So to speak,” or, “As it were.”

The name MEILIGMATA is given to the words so used, from
μείλιγμα (meiligma), anything that serves to soothe. And this from
μειλίσσω (meiliss?), to soothe, propitiate.
