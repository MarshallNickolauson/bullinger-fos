Hypotyposis; or, Word-Picture

Visible Representation of Objects or Actions by Words

Hy’-po-ty-po-sis. Greek, ὑποτύπωσις, from ὑποτυποῦν (hypotypoun),
to sketch out; from ὑπό (hypo), under, and τυποῦν (typoun), to
impress; and this from τύττος (typos), impression. № occurs twice in the
New Testament (1Ti. 1:16 and 2Ti. 1:13). In the plural it would express
what we call “outlines.”

The name is given to this figure because it describes an action,
event, person, condition, passion, etc., in a lively and forcible manner,
giving a vivid representation of it.
In Latin, therefore, the name is REPRSENTATIO, representation,
and ADUMBRATIO, a shadowing out or a sketching out in words.

Other Greek names of this figure are DIATYPOSIS (di’-a-ty-po-
sis), from διά (dia), through, and τυπιοῦν (typoun), to impress. The
verb meaning {ο form thoroughly, to give a thorough form.

ENARGEIA, ἐνάργεια (en-ar-gei-a), vivid description, visible
representation (in words).

PHANTASIA, φαντασία (phan-ta’-si-a), a making visible, a
presentation of objects to the mind-

ICON (εἰκών, eik?n), an image, figure, likeness; and Latin IMAGO,
an imitation, copy, or picture, but especially a statue, visibly presenting
the object to the eye or mind.

EICASIA. Greek, εἰκασία (ε{-ο8΄-5{-8), a likeness, or image, from
εἰκάζω (eikazo), to make like to, represent by a likeness.

Thus the nature of this figure is quite clear from the various names
given to it. Hypotyposis is employed whenever anything is so
described as to present it forcibly and vividly to the mind.

There are many examples in Scripture: but it is not necessary to
transcribe whole passages, and in some cases whole chapters, in full.
