Interjectio; or, Interjection

Parenthetic Addition by Way of Feeling

In’-ter-jec’-ti-o, from the Latin, inter, between, and jacio, to throw:
something thrown in between. While, therefore, the word is similar in
meaning to the former figure, this term is confined to an exclamation
which is thrown in by way of parenthesis.

But note that, when the exclamation is added at the end of a
passage, it is called Epiphonema (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

And when it is quite independent of the context, and forms a
definite part of it, it is called Ecphonesis (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).
