Anaphora; or, Like Sentence-Beginnings

The Repetition of the same Word at the beginning of successive
Sentences

A-naph’-o-ra, from two Greek words, dvd (ana), again, and φέρω
(pherdb), to bring or carry. It means a carrying back, reference, or
repeating over again.

This figure is also sometimes called EPANAPHORA: which is the
same word with ἐπή (epi), upon, prefixed. In Latin it is called RELATIO.

This figure is so-called because it is the repeating of the same
word at the beginning of successive clauses: thus adding weight and
emphasis to statements and arguments by calling special attention to
them.

Anaphora differs from Epibole (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). In the
case of Epibole several words are repeated, consisting of a sentence
or phrase; whereas, in Anaphora only one word is thus repeated.
Scripture abounds with this figure, which adds great importance to
many of its solemn statements.
