Anteisagoge; or, Counter-Question

The Answering of one Question by asking another

An-teis’-a-g6‘-gee. Greek, ἀντεισαγωγή, a bringing in instead; from
ἀντί (anti), against or instead; sic (eis), in; ἄγειν (agein), to lead or
bring.

The figure is so called, because a question is answered by asking
another.

It is called also ANTICATALLAXIS (an -ti-cat’-al-lax’-is). Greek,
ἀντικατάλλαξις, a setting off or balancing of one thing against another
(as in trade).

The Greeks called it also ANTHUPOPHORA (an’-thu-poph -o-ra).
Greek, ἀνθυποφορά, a reply to an objection; from avti (anti), against,
ὑπτό (hupo), φέρειν (pherein), to bring.

Hence the Latin names of the Figure: COMPENSATIO,
compensation, and CONTRARIA ILLATIO, a bringing in against.
