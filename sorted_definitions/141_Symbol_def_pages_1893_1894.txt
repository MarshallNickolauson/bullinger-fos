Symbol

A material Object substituted for a moral or spiritual Truth

Greek, σύμβολον (symbolon), from σύν (syn), together, and βάλλειν
(ballein), to cast; hence a casting together. Used by the Greeks, much
in the same way as we use the word “coupon,” where one part
corresponded with or represented another part. Hence, in language,
the use of one thing to represent another; or, the use of a material
object to represent a moral or spiritual truth.

The word does not occur in the New Testament, and nothing is
said in Scripture as to one thing being so used. The assertion as to
anything being a symbol of another rests entirely on human authority,
and depends for its accuracy on its agreement with the teaching of
Scripture.

The nearest word to symbol is mystery; and, by the Fathers,
µυστήριον was used as being synonymous with σύμβολον.

Μυστήριον (mysteerion) means secret; * [Note: See The Mystery,
by the same author and publisher.] and later it came to mean a secret
sign or symbol. Justin Martyr (A.D. 148) sayst [Note: Apology, i. 27.]
that in all false religions the serpent was represented as “a great
symbol and mystery.”
