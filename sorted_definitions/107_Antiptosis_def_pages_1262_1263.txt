Antiptosis; or, Exchange of Cases

Exchange of one case for another

Anr-tip-tqpr-sis (ἀντίππωσις), from ἀντί (anti), against or instead of; and
TITWOIC (pt@sis), a falling; in grammar an inflection or a case of a noun
in declension; from πίττειν (piptein), to fall.

The figure is so called, because one case is put instead of another
case. Especially when the absolute is put for the construct: i.e., where
the governing noun is changed for the noun in regimen

Antiptosis is to be distinguished from Нурайаде. In Hypallage, the
two words and cases are interchanged, and the sense and relation of
the two reversed; while in Antiptosis the governing noun becomes the
adjective instead of the noun in regimen.
