Thaumasmos; or, Wondering

An Expression of Feeling by way of Wonder

Thau-mas‘-mos. Greek, θαυμασμός, а marvelling. The figure is used
when, instead of describing or stating a thing as a matter of fact, it is
expressed in the form of marvelling at it, either directly or by
implication.

When the wonder is expressed as an exclamation, it combines
with it the character of Ecphonesis (see below).
