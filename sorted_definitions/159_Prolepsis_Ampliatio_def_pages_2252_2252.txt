Prolepsis (Ampliatio); or, Anticipation

An Anticipation of some future Time which cannot yet be enjoyed: but
has to be deferred

Pro-leep-sis. Greek, πρόληψις, a taking beforehand, anticipation.

The Figure is so called when we anticipate what is going to be
done, and speak of future things as present.

The name is also given to the Figure when we anticipate what is
going to be said, and meet an opponent’s objection. But that Prolepsis
is distinguished by the further description “Occupatio”; because, in that
case, the opponent’s objection is not only anticipated, but seized and
taken possession of (as the word means).

Whereas Prolepsis-when it anticipates time which it cannot hold or
keep possession of, but has to defer it, after having anticipated itis
distinguished from the other by the word “Ampliatio,” which means an
adjourning.
