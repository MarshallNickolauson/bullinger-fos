Epitrochasmos; or, Summarising

A running lightly over by way of Summary

When the enumeration called Synathroesmus is made, not for the
sake of amplifying, but only for the sake of abbreviating, by
summarising, so as to hurry over what is being said (rather than for
the sake of dwelling upon it), so as to pass on quickly to another
subject, it is then called EPITROCHASMOS (Ep -i-tro-chas-mos),
from étri (epi), upon or over, and τροχάζειν (trochazein), to run along
quickly. Hence Epitrochasmus means a running lightly over.

The Latins called it PERCURSIO, which means a running through.

In this connection, it is practically the same as Asyndeton (q.v.
[Note: Which see.] ), where examples may be found. See Exo.
15:9-10.

Epitrochasmus is therefore a figure of Omission; in that the
conjunction “and” is omitted for the sake of running quickly through the
enumeration; and an omission of sense also, in that it abbreviates and
summarises.

On the other hand it comes under the head of figures involving
addition in that it at the same time certainly amplifies by a copious
pouring forth of words.

Thus, while there is an actual addition of words, that very addition
is for the purpose of avoiding a longer statement.

We have therefore mentioned this figure here in this division.
