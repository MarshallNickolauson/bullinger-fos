Epanadiplosis; or, Encircling

The Repetition of the same Word or Words at the beginning and end
of a Sentence

Epr-an-a-di-plopr-s€s. Greek ἐπαναδίπλωσις, from ἐτή (epi), upon, ava
(ana), again, and διτλοῦς (diplous), a doubling.
It means a doubling upon again, and the Figure is so called
because the same word is repeated both at the beginning and at the
end of a sentence.

The Latins called it INCLUSIO, inclusion: either because the first
word of the sentence is included at the end, or because of the
importance of the matter which is thus included between the two
words.

They called it also CYCLUS, from the Greek κύκλος (kyklos), a
circle, because the repetition concluded what is said, as in a circle.

When this figure is used, it marks what is said as being comprised
in one complete circle, thus calling our attention to its solemnity; giving
completeness of the statement that is made, or to the truth
enumerated, thus marking and emphasizing its importance.

The Massorah gives two lists of this peculiar form of repetition,*
[Note: See Ginsburg’s Massorah, Rubrics, 424, Vol. ., letter i; and
98, Vol. Ι., letter ly which we have incorporated in our examples
marking them with an asterisk.

The Figure is frequently hidden or lost in translation (both in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] апа R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ), so that in these
cases we shall be obliged to vary the rendering in order to properly
exhibit it. Some are very difficult to reproduce, as in our first example.
