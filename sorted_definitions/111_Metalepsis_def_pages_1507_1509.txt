Metalepsis; or, Double Metonymy

Two Metonymies, one contained in the other, but only one expressed
Met’-a-lep’sis, from µετά (méta), behind, and λείπω (leipq), to leave,
a leaving behind.

The Figure is so called, because something more is deficient than
in Metonymy, which has to be supplied entirely by the thought, rather
than by the association or relation of ideas, as is the case in
Metonymy.

This something more that is deficient consists of another
Metonymy, which the mind has to supply. Hence Metalepsis is a
double or compound Metonymy, or a Metonymy in two stages, only
one of which is expressed.

Thus, for example, when we say that a man “drank his house,” we
do not mean that he drank the building of bricks and mortar with its
contents, but we first use the word “house,” and put it by Metonymy for
the money it fetched when sold, and then, by a second Metonymy, the
“money” is put for the drink it purchased, which was what the man
actually drank.

So Virgil (Buc. Ecl i. 70) speaks of Meliboeus returning to hit home
“after some ears of corn,” where the “ears of corn” are first put (by
Metonymy of Subject) for the harvest-time, and then the harvest-time
is put mentally (by Metonymy of Adjunct) for a years So that what
Meliboeus means is that he will return after some years.

The Latins called the figure TRANSUMPTIO: i.e., a taking across from
one to another. They sometimes called it TRANSLATIO, a transferring
across; but this latter name is best reserved as representing Metaphor
rather than Metalepsis.
