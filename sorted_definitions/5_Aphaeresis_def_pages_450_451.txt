Apheresis: or, Front-Cut

Pronounced Aph-er’-e-sis, is the Greek word ἀφαίρεσις, and means а
taking away from, from ἀφαιρεῖν (aphairein), to take away, from απο.
(apo), away, αἱρεῖν (hairein), to take. It is a figure of etymology which
relates to the spelling of words, and is used of the cutting off of a letter
or syllable from the beginning of a word. We may, therefore, give it the
English name of FRONT-CUT. We see it in such words as ‘neath for
beneath; mazed for amazed. In the Scripture we have an example in
Coniah for Jeconiah. He is called Jeconiah in his genealogy (1Ch.
3:16); but, in Jer. 22:24, where Jehovah declares that He will cut him
off, his name corresponds with the act, for the front part is cut off, and
he is called “Coniah.”* [Note: Only here, and in 37:1.]

Jeconiah means Let Jehovah establish. Cutting off the first syllable
may intimate the disappointment (for the time) of the hope.

Josiah, who justified the hope expressed in his name (Let Jehovah
heal) that Jehovah would establish the kingdom, gave his son the
name of Eliakim, afterwards called Jehoiakim, which means God will
establish (as does his grandson’s, Jehoiachin-this Jeconiah). But his
hopes were vain. Josiah’s family is remarkable for the manner in
which the names are broken up and their kingdom overtaken by
disaster.

See Jer. 22:24. “As | live, saith the Lord, though Coniah, the son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet
would | pluck thee thence”; and read on to the end of the chapter.

In verse 30, “Write ye this man childless” is explained to mean that
not one of his seven sons (1Ch. 3:17-18) sat upon his throne, but
Zerubbabel, his grandson, became governor after Coniah had died in
Babylon (2Ki. 25:29-30).
