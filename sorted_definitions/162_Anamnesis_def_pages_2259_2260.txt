Anamnesis; or, Recalling

An Expression of Feeling by Way of Recalling to Mind

An‘-am-nee’-sis. Greek, ἀνάμνησις, a calling to remembrance, from
ava (ana), again, and µιμνήσκειν (mimneeskein), to put in mind.

This figure is used when the course of the direct statement is
changed, to recall something to mind; and the matter, instead of being
stated as a fact, as it might have been, is mentioned by way of calling
it to memory.

It is a very effective method of emphasising what we wish to
impress on another.

The Latins called it RECOLLECTIO, recollection.
