Paradiegesis; or, a Bye-Leading

Addition of Outside Facts by way of Reasoning

Par-a-di-ee-gee-sis, from the Greek παρά (para), beside, διά (dia),
through, or by means of, and ἡγεῖσθαι (heegeisthai), to lead, or guide.
Hence the figure is used when there is an addition of facts which are
beside the case, yet help to establish it.
