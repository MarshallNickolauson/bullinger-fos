Periphrasis; or, Circumlocution

When a Description is used instead of the Name

Pe-riph’-ra-sis, Tepigpacic, from περί (peri), around or about, and
φράζειν (phrazein), to speak.

The figure is so called because more words than are necessary
are used to describe anything: as when a thing is spoken of by a
description of it, instead of simply using its name: and this for the sake
of calling attention to it; and in order to emphasize and increase the
effect. Or, when a person or thing is spoken of by some attribute,
instead of by its proper simple name: as when, instead of saying
Luther, we say “the monk that shook the world,” or “the miner’s son.”

When this is done for emphasis, and to enhance the meaning, it is
called Periphrasis, and by the Latins CIRCUMLOCUTIO, or
CIRCUITIO: i.e., a speaking or going round about a thing.

When this is done to avoid what may be indelicate or unseemly, or
to hide what might in some way give offence, then it is called
Euphemism (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) or smooth-speech, {6., an
elegant or refined expression for a distasteful or coarse one, or a
gentle and beautiful expression instead of the strictly literal one, which
might offend the ear or the persons addressed. But as this, though a
kind of Periphrasis, is the change or substitution of one word or term
for another, we have described and illustrated Euphemism under our
third great division, viz., Figures involving Change.
