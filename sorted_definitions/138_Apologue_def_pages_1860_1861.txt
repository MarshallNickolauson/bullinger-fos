Apologue; or, Fable

A Fictitious Narrative used for Illustration

Ap‘-o-logue. Greek, ἀπόλογος, from ἁπό (apo), from, and λόγος
(logos), speech (from λέγειν, to speak), a story, tale; and especially a
fable. Latin, FABULA, a fable.

An Apologue (or Fable) differs from a Parable, in that the Parable
describes what is likely or probable, or at any rate what is believed by
the hearers as probable, while the Fable is not limited by such
considerations, and is used of impossiblities, such as trees, or
animals, and inanimate things talking and acting.

The Fable, therefore, is a fictitious narrative intended to illustrate
some maxim or truth.
