Syllepsis; or, Change in Concord

Grammatical Syllepsis, by which there is a change in the Ideas rather
than in actual words, so that the concord is logical rather than
grammatical

Syl-lep‘-sis. Greek, !.'!, from '' (sun), together with, апа \2"!
(leepsis), a taking.

It is a figure by which one word, or the meaning of one word, is
taken with another; or, when one word is used, and another idea is
meant. When involving addition of words, or sense, it has already
been described in Div. Il.

It is a kind of Enallage, or Heterosis; in that there is an exchange
of genders, of numbers, or of both. But it differs from Enallage, in that
the change takes place rather in the idea than in the actual words.
It is a kind of Zeugma, in that one adjective or verb belonging to
two or more nouns of different genders, persons, or numbers, agrees
with one rather than with another.

Syllepsis therefore depends on a change or disturbance in the
concord of parts of speech; in making a /ogica/ rather than a
grammatical concord.
