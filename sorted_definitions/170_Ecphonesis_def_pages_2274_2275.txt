Ecphonesis; or, Exclamation

An Expression of Feeling by way of Exclamation

Ec’-phé-nee’-sis. Greek, ἐκφώνησις, a crying out, an exclamation,
from ἐκ (ek), out, and φωνεῖν (phonein), to speak, from φωνή
(ph6énee), voice or sound.

The figure is used when, through feeling, we change our mode of

speech; and, instead of merely making a statement, express it by an
exclamation. So that Ecphonesis is an outburst of words, prompted by
emotion, and is not used as though any reply were expected.

It was called also ANAPHONESIS, an’-a-phé’-nee’-sis, the same
word, with ама (ana), up, prefixed instead of ἐκ (ek), out, a lifting up of
the voice.

The exclamation itself is called ANAPHONEMA (An ‘-a-phé-nee-
ma).

The Latins called it EXCLAMATIO, exclamation.

But note that, when the exclamation occurs at the end of a
sentence, as an addition by way of conclusion, it is called Epiphonema
(see page 464).

When the Ecphonesis is an exclamation thrown in parenthetically,
it is called Interjectio (see page 478).
