Epitrope; or, Admission

Admission of Wrong in order to gain what is Right

E-pit’-ro-pee. Greek, ἐπιτροπή, reference, arbitration, from ἐπιτρέπειν,
to turn over, surrender, (from ἐτή (epi), upon, and τρέπειν (trepein), to
turn).

The Figure is used when we surrender a point which we feel to be
wrong, but we admit it for the sake of argument. In Synchoresis (q.v.
[Note: Which see.] ), we concede what is right in itself; but, in
Epitrope, we admit what is wrong, giving way to the feelings or
unreasonableness of another, in order that we may more effectually
carry our point.

The Latins called it PERMISSIO, a giving up, unconditional
surrender.

The figure sometimes approaches to /rony (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]
); when “what is admitted” is not really granted, but only apparently so
for argument’s sake.
