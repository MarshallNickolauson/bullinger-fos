Acrostichion: or, Acrostic

Repetition of the same or successive Letters at the beginnings of
Words or Clauses

The English name of this figure is Ac-ros’-tic, and comes from the
Greek, ἄκρος (akros), at the point (i.e., at the beginning or the end)
and στίχος (stichos), a row or order. It is a figure of repetition, not of
the same letter, but of different letters at the beginning or end of words
arranged in lines.

These letters may be thus repeated at the beginning or end of
lines, either in the same order in which they occur in the Alphabet (in
which case they are called ABECEDARIAN), or in some other certain
or particular order, making the letters at the beginning or end of
successive lines or words spell another word.

The Greeks gave it another name, PARASTICHIS (парасту!с)
from παρά (para), beside, and στίχος (stichos), a row, meaning that
the letters are placed at the side.
By the use of this peculiar figure, our attention is attracted to the
special importance of certain passages. There are thirteen such
passages in the Scriptures, and whenever we meet with them, we are
asked to give great attention to them, and to put marked emphasis
upon them.
