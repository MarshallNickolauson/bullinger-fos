Homeeoptoton: or, Like Inflections

The Repetition of Inflections
Ho-me-op ‘-to-ton, from ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and TrTWoic (ptqpsis), a
falling, which in grammar means an inflection: i.e., a case formed by
the declining of a noun, or tenses, είο., in the conjugation of a verb: as
in the Latin message of Julius Сбзаг, “veni, vidi, vici,” i.e., “I came, |
saw, | conquered.”

This figure differs from the two former, in that the endings are not
only similar, but the similarity arises from the same inflections of verbs
or nouns, etc.

It will be seen, therefore, that this figure belongs peculiarly to the
Original languages, and cannot always be transferred in translation.
