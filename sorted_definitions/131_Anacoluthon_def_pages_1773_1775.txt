Anacoluthon; or, Non-sequence

A breaking off the sequence of Thought

An?-a-co-lu??-thon. Greek, @(L'/\, from ° or, negative, and © |,
| (akolouthos), following: i.e., not following, want of sequence or
connection in a sentence, the latter part of which does not follow on or
correspond with the former part.
This figure is so-called, because the construction with which a
proposition begins is abandoned; and, either for the sake of
perspicuity, emphasis, or elegance, the sentence proceeds in a
manner, different from that in which it set out.

Human writings of deep thought or feeling or argument frequently
have the figure Anacoluthon, which in these cases is mere irregularity
attributable to inadvertence, arising from the negligence or
carelessness of the writer.

But, in the case of the Scriptures, where the Holy Spirit is the
Author, and all is perfect, the figure not only imparts grace, but
strength and force to the language, and is intended to catch and fix
the attention of the reader. In this case, of course, what is abandoned
is not further necessary. It has served its purpose in arresting, and so
the argument passes on to that to which the attention is to be given.
