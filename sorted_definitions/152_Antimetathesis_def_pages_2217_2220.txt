Antimetathesis; or, Dialogue

A Transference of Speakers

An-ti-me-tath’-e-sis, from ἀντί (anti), against, or opposite to, and
µετάθεσις (metathesis), a placing differently (and this from µετά
(meta), beyond, or over, and τιθέναι (tithenai), to place or set.

So that Antimetathesis is a figure by which there is a transposition
of one thing over against another, especially of one person over
against another; as when the writer or speaker addresses the reader
or hearer in the second person as if he were actually present.

Hence the figure is called also POLYPROSOPON, pol’-y-pros-6-
pon, from πολύς (polus), many, and проситом (prosdpon), a person.
Hence many persons, or more than one person.

Sometimes the address is simple; sometimes it is continued, in
which case it is called a Dialogue.
