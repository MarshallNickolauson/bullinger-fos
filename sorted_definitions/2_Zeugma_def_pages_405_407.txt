Zeugma; or, Unequal Yoke

Zeug’-ma. Greek ζεῦγμα, a yoke; from ζεύγνυµι (zeugnumi), to join or
yoke together.

This name is given to the figure, because one verb is yoked on to
two subjects while grammatically it strictly refers only to one of them:
The two subjects properly require two different verbs. This figure,
therefore, differs from one of the ordinary forms of Ellipsis, where one
of the two verbs is omitted which belongs to only one clause. (See
under Relative Ellipsis, page 62.)

The second verb is omitted, and the grammatical law is broken, in
order that our attention may be attracted to the passage, and that we
may thus discover that the emphasis is to be placed on the verb that is
used, and not be distracted from it by the verb that is omitted. Though
the law of grammar is violated, it is not “bad grammar’; for it is broken
with design, legitimately broken, under the special form, usage, or
figure, called ZEUGMA.

So perfectly was this figure studied and used by the Greeks, that
they gave different names to its various forms, according to the
position of the verb or yoke in the sentence. There are four forms of
Zeugma:-

1. PROTOZEUGMA, ante-yoke. Latin, INJUNCTUM, joined together.
2. MESOZEUGMA, middle-yoke. Latin, CONJUNCTUM, joined with.
3. HYPOZEUGMA, end-yoke; or subjoined.
4. SYNEZEUGMENON, connected-yoke. Latin, ADJUNCTUM, joined together.
