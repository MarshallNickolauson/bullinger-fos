Tiologia; or, Cause Shown

The rendering a Reason for what is said or done

Ae -ti-o-log‘-ia (Aetiology). Greek Αἰτιολογία, rendering a reason, from
aitia (aitia), a cause, and λόγος (logos), a description.

The figure is used when, either directly or indirectly, the speaker or
writer renders a reason for what he thinks, says, or does.

The figure was also called APODEIXIS (Ap-o-deix’-is). Greek,
ἀπόδειξις, full demonstration, from ἀποδεικνύναι (apodeiknunai), to
point out, demonstrate.

The Latins called it CAUS. REDDITIO: rendering a reason, or
showing the cause.
