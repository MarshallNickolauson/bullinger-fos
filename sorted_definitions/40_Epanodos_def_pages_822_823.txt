Epanodos; or, Inversion

The Repetition of the same Words in an inverse Order (but same
Sense)

E-pan’-o-dos is from ἐπί (epi), upon, ava (ana), back, and ὁδός
(hodos), a way, and means a way back again, or more simply a return.

After two, three, or more words have been mentioned, they are
repeated, not in the same order again, but backward.

The Latins called it REGRESSIO, i.e., regression, and INVERSIO,
ie., inversion.

When propositions are inverted and thus contrasted, and not
merely the words, the figure is called ANTIMETABOLE (see the next
figure).

When only the subject matter is thus related it is called
CHIASMUS (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), though this may also be called
an Epanodos. This we have given under Correspondence. When
words or phrases are repeated in this inverse order it is called
SYNANTESIS, a meeting together.
