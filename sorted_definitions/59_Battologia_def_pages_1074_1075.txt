Battologia; or, Vain Repetition

Bat-to-log’-i-a, βαττολογία, vain repetitions. These are repetitions, of
course, which are vain, meaningless, and senseless.

None of these is to be found in the word of God. Indeed, we are
exhorted not to use them as the heathen do, who think that by using
them in their prayers they shall be “heard for their much speaking.”
The verb in Mat. 6:7 is βαττολογήσητε (battologee -seete) use not vain
repetitions. The Holy Spirit therefore does not use them: so that we
have no examples to give for this figure which man has named and so
frequently uses.

Examples of man’s use of Battologia may easily be found, e.g.,
1Кi. 18:26. Act. 19:34, etc. Also in the Prayer Book.
