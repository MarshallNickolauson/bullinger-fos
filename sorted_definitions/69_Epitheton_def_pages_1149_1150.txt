Epitheton; or, Epithet

A Naming of a Thing by describing it

E-pith’-e-ton. Greek, ἐπίθετον, from ἐπίθετος (epithetos), placed upon,
or added. The figure is so-called when an adjective or noun is used,
which adds to the sense of the thing spoken of by simply holding forth
some attribute, character, or quality descriptive of it. The adjective or
the noun used for it by Enallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) is thus
placed in apposition to it for the purpose of amplification by way of
distinction, explanation, or description.

Hence it was called by the Latins APPOSITUM, and is so put by
apposition.

When the epithet is continued and used, after the reason for its
being given has ceased, it is then called Ampliatio (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ). Most of the examples will be found under that name. An
Ampliatio is a change; an Epitheton is an addition.
