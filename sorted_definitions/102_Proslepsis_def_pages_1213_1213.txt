Proslepsis; or, Assumption

Addition (full) of what is professed to be ignored
Pros’-leeps’-is (πρόσληψις), a taking or assuming besides. From
πρός (pros), to, toward, or beside, and λῆψις (leepsis), a taking, from
λαμβάνω (lamban?), to take.

By the Latins it was called ASSUMPTIO, an assuming, or taking
to, and CIRCUMDUCTIO, a leading round.

This name is given to the preceding figure of Paraleipsis, when it is
expanded beyond its proper limits; and the speaker or writer, after
having professed to omit it, proceeds actually to add and describe the
particulars.
