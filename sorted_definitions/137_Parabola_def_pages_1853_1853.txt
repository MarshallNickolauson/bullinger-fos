Parabola; or, Parable: i.e., Continued Simile

Comparison by continued Resemblance

Par-ab’-o-la. Greek, παραβολή (pa-rab’-o-lee), a placing beside for
the purpose of comparison, from παρά (para), beside, and βάλλειν
(ballein), to throw or cast.

The classical use of the word was for one of the subdivisions of
παράδειγµα (paradeigma), an example, viz., a presentation of an
analogous case by way of illustration.

In the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 Б.с.).] it
occurs about thirty times as the translation of 22? (mahshal), and of
no other word: and, if we look at some of the sayings to which the
word “parable” is applied, the meaning which was attached to it will be
clearly seen.
