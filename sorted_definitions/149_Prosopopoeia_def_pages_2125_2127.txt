Prosopopeeia; or, Personification

Things represented as Persons

Pros’-6-po-poe’-i-a (i.€., pros’-0-po-pe'-ya). Greek, προσωποποῄα,
from πρόσωπον (prosopon), face or person, and ποιεῖν (poiein), to
make.

A figure by which things are represented or spoken of as persons;
or, by which we attribute intelligence, by words or actions, to inanimate
objects or abstract ideas.

The figure is employed when the absent are spoken of (or to) as
present; when the dead are spoken of as alive; or when anything (e.g.,
a country) is addressed as a person.

Personification is the English name for the figure.

The Latins called it PERSONIFICATIO, or PERSON. FICTIO, the
making or feigning of a person. Also CONFORMATIO, a conforming or
fashioning, delineation, conception.

The figure of Personification may be divided into the following six
classes or groups:-

I. The members of the Human body.
II. Animals.
III. The products of the earth.
IV. Inanimate things.
V. Kingdoms, countries, and states.
VI. Human actions, etc., attributed to things, etc.
