Allegory; or, Continued Metaphor and
Hypocatastasis

Continued Comparison by Representation or Implication

Al’-le-go-ry. Greek, ἀλληγορία, from ἄλλος (allos), another, and
ἀγορεύειν (agoreuein), to speak or make a speech in the agora (i.e.,
assembly).

Few figures have been the subject of greater controversy than
Allegory; or, have been more variously defined. One class of
Rhetoricians declare that it is a continued metaphor: and another
class declare that it is not. But, as is often the case under such
circumstances, neither is quite correct, because both have a part of
the truth and put it for the whole. Neither of the contending parties
takes into consideration the existence of Hypocatastasis. And this fact
accounts for the confusion, not only with regard to Allegory, but also
with regard to Metaphor.

All three figures are based on comparison. Simile is comparison by
resemblance; Metaphor is comparison’ by — representation;
Hypocatastasis is comparison by implication.

In the first the comparison is stated; in the second it is substituted;
in the third it is implied.

Thus Allegory is a continuation of the latter two, Metaphor or
Hypocatastasis; while the Parable (q.v. [Note: Which see] ) is a
continuation of the Simile.
This definition clears the whole ground, and explains the whole of
the difficulties, and reconciles the different schools.
The Allegory, therefore, is of two kinds; one in which it is continued

Metaphor (as in Psa. 23:1-6), where the two things are both
mentioned (Jehovah, and the Shepherd’s care), and what is asserted
belongs to the principal object; the other, in which it is continued
Hypocatastasis (Psa. 80:8-15), where only one thing is mentioned (the
vine), and what is asserted belongs properly to the Secondary object;
viz., to Israel. Israel whom it really refers, is not mentioned, but only
implied.
