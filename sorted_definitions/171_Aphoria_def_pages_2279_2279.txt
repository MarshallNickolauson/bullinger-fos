Aporia; or, Doubt

An Expression of Feeling by way of Doubt

A-p6‘-ri-a. Greek, ἁπορία, a being in doubt, or at а loss, from ἄπορος
(aporos), without a passage (a, privative, and Πόρος (poros), а
passage).

The figure is used when the speaker expresses himself as though
he were at a loss what course to pursue; or when we express a doubt
as to what we ought to think or say or do.

It was also called DIAPORESIS (Di’-a-po-ree’-sis). Greek,
διαπόρησις, from did (dia), through, and ἁπόρησις (aporeesis), a
being without passage or resource.

The Latins called it DUBITATIO, a wavering, a doubting,
uncertainty, doubt, and ADDUBITATIO, the former word with ad, fo,
denoting the beginning of the hesitation or doubting.
