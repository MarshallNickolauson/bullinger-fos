Merismos; or, Distribution

An Enumeration of the Parts of a Whole which has been mentioned

Mé-ris’-mos. Greek, µερισμός (merismos), division, from µέρος
(meros), a part. The figure is so called because, after mentioning a
thing as a whole, the parts are afterwards enumerated.

Also EPIMERISMOS, which is merismos with ἐπί (epi), upon,
prefixed (Ep ’-i-mé-ris-mus).

It was called also DIALLAGE (D?-al?-la-gee), διαλλαγή,
interchange, from διά (dia), through, or asunder, and ἀλλάσσειν
(allassein), to make other than it is, to change throughout.

The Latins called it DISTRIBUTIO (Dis-tri-bu-ti-o), and
DISCRIMINATIO (Dis-crim’-i-na-ti-o). Also DIGESTIO (Di-ges -ti-o),
ie., reduction to order, classification.

Though these names express, in the first instance, division, we
have classed the figure under figures of addition; because, after the
thing has been named and mentioned, it is divided up, and the various
parts are added together to enhance the effect, increase the
emphasis, and amplify the sense.
