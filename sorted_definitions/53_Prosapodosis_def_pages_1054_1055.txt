Prosapodosis; or, Detailing

A Returning for Repetition and Explanation

Pros-a-pod’-o-sis, a giving back to, or return. It is from πρός (pros), to,
and ἁπόδοσις (apodosis), a giving back; (from ἁποδίδωμι
(apodidomi), to give back, return).

The figure is so called because after the mention of two or three
words or subjects together, there is a return to them again, and they
are repeated separately for purposes of definition or explanation.

The Latins called it REDITIO (from redire), which means the same
thing, a going or returning back; or REDDITIO (from reddire), a giving
back. They called it also SEJUGATIO, a disjunction or separation,
from sejungo, to unyoke (jugum, a yoke), or disjoin, because of the
separation of the words or subjects which takes place: first being
mentioned or yoked together, and then unyoked and mentioned
separately.

For the same reason they called it DISJUNCTIO, disjunction.

The Greeks used a similar descriptive word when they called the
figure DIEZEUGMENON (Di-e-zeug’-me-non), from zeugma, a yoke,
i.e., an unyoking, or disjunction.
