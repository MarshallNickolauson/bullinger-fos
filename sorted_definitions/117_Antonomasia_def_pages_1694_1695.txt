Antonomasia; or, Name-Change

Change of proper name for appellative; or vice versa

Ап -to-no-mer-si-a. Greek, ἀντονομασία, a different name, from
ἀντονομάζειν, to name instead; and this from ἀντί (anti), instead, and
ἀνομάζειν (onomazein), to name (from ὄνομα (onoma), a name).
This figure is so called because a proper name is put for a
common or appellative noun; or because, on the contrary, an
appellation derived from some attribute is put for a proper name. As
when a name of some office, dignity, profession, science, or trade, is
used instead of the proper name of the person: e.g., when we speak
of the Queen as Her Majesty, or of a nobleman as his lordship; or
when a wise man is called a Solon, or a Solomon, etc.

When we speak of David as “the Psalmist,” or of Paul as “the
Apostle,” we use the figure Antonomasia.
