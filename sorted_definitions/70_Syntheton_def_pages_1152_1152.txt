Syntheton; or, Combination

A placing together of two Words by Usage

Syn’-the-ton. Greek, σύνθετον, from σύν (sun), together, and τιθέναι
(tithenai), to place. Hence, σύνθετος (synthetos) means put together.

It is used of this Figure because two words are by common usage
joined by a conjunction for the sake of emphasis, as when we say
“time and tide,” “end and aim,” “rank and fortune.”

It differs from Synthesis (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]). And also from
Hendiadys, where only one thing is meant, though two are used (see
Hendiadys).
