Anabasis; or, Gradual Ascent

An Increase of Sense in successive Sentences

A-n?b’-a-sis. Greek, ἀνάβασις, from ava (ana), up, and βαΐνειν
(bainein), to go; βάσις (basis) means a stepping, or a step. So that
Anabasis means a going up* [Note: Hence, the journey or expedition
of Cyrus up from the coast into Central Asia is called his Anabasis, by
Xenophon.] or ascent. The Figure is so called when a writing, speech,
or discourse, ascends up step by step, each with an increase of
emphasis or sense.

This figure was called by the Latins INCREMENTUM (/n?-cr?-
men?-tum), growth or increase, from incresco, to grow on or upon.
Hence our words “increase” and “increment.”

When this increase or ascent is from weaker to stronger
expression, and is confined to words, it is called Climax (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]).

[N.B.-When the sense or gradation is downward instead of
upward, it is called Catabasis, see below.]

The figure was also called AUXESIS (aux-ee-sis), growth or
increase.

This increase is often connected with Parallelism (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]).

When the increase is not a mere increase of vehemence, or of
evil, but leads up from things inferior to things superior; from things
terrestial to things celestial; from things mundane to things spiritual;
the figure is called ANAGOGE (an?-a-g?-gee), from dvd (ana), again
or up, and ἄγειν (agein), to lead, a leading up.
