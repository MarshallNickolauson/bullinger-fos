Epexegesis; or, Fuller Explaining

A Repetition for the purpose of explaining more fully
Ερ-εχ΄-ε-σεε΄-δί5, a returning to explain. \t is from ἐπί (epi), upon, ἐξ
(ex), out, and ἡγεῖσθαι (heegeisthai), to lead or guide.

The figure is so called because the repetition is for purposes of
explanation.

It has several names. It is called EXEGESIS (ex’-e-gee’sis), an
explanation.

ECPHRASIS (ec’-phra-sis), from ἐκ (ek), out, and φράζω (phrazo),
to give to know, cause to understand, intimate, point out. Hence the
figure is called Ecphrasis, which means an explaining, recounting-
It is also called EPLCHREMA (epi-chree‘-ma), from ἐτή (epi),
upon, and χρῆμα (chreema), a furnishing, from χράοµα! (chra’-o-mai),
to furnish what is needful. The figure is thus called because upon what
has been said less clearly the needful information is added or
furnished.

This figure Epexegesis may be divided into three parts: (1) where
what is added is a working out and developing what has been
previously said (Exergasia); (2) where what has been said is dwelt
upon to deepen the impression (Epimone); and (3) where what is
added is by way of interpretation (Hermeneia).

For these three Figures see the following.
