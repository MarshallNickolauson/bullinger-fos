Prosopographia; or, Description of Persons

Pros?-?-po-graph?-i-a, from πρόσωπιον (pros?-?-pon), a face, one’s
look, or countenance, and later, a person; and γράφειν (graphein), to
write, or describe. 

Hence Prosopographia is a vivid description of a
person by delineating the general mien, dress manners, etc.

Called by the Latins PERSON DESCRIPTIO, description of a
person.
