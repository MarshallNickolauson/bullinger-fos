Hysterologia; or, the First, Last

The First of two things put Last: or, the opposite of Hysteron-Proteron

Hys’-ter-o-log’-i-a. Greek, ή τς from 2!!>)|! (hysteros), last, and
Le | (logos), speech, discourse.

A figure by which that which is put last, ought, according to the
usual order, to come first.

It is the opposite of Hysteron-Proteron; except that it refers toa
transposition of connected events, rather than of words.

It differs from Hysteresis (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).
