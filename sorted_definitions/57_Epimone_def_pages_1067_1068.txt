Epimone; or, Lingering

Repetition in order to dwell upon for the sake of Impressing

E-pim’-o-nee. Greek, ἑπιμονή, a staying on, or dwelling upon, from ἑτή
(epi), upon, and μένω (men?), to remain, or dwell. In Latin
COMMORATIO.

This figure is so called because the repetition is not of words, but
of sense, by way of dwelling upon the principal point of a subject, so
that it may be well understood, and remain with due weight upon the
mind of the hearer or reader.
