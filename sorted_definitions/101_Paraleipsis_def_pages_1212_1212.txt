Paraleipsis; or, a Passing by

Addition (brief) of that which is professedly ignored
Par-a-leips’-is, παράλειψις, a passing over, omitting, from παρά
(para), beside, and λείπω (leip?), to leave behind. Sometimes spelt
PARALEPSIS.

Called also PARASIOPESIS, παρασιώπησις, a passing over in
silence, from παρά (para), beside, and σιώπησις (si?peesis), a being
silent, from σιωπάω (5ἱ2ρ82), to be silent.

The Latins called it PRTERMISSIO, a /eaving aside,
proetermission, a passing over, and PRTERITIO, a going past,
passing by.

This figure is used when the speaker professes a wish to pass
something by in silence, which he nevertheless adds by a brief
allusion to it.
