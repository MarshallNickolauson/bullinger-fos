Amphibologia; or, Double Meaning

A Word or Phrase susceptible of two Interpretations

Am-phib-o-log’-i-a, from the Greek Gugi (amphi), on both sides, βόλος
(bolos), a throw, and λόγος (logos), a word; hence ἀμφιβολογία is a
word Or phrase susceptible of two interpretations. It is not
synonymous with what we speak of as ambiguous; which means that
which is uncertain or equivocal.

A statement which is amphibological has two meanings, both of
which are absolutely true. (An equivocation has two meanings also,
but only one of them is true.) There are several such statements in
Scripture, and indeed all prophecies are more or less of this character.
They are the words of Jehovah, who was, and is, and is to come;
hence His words have a fulness of reference and meaning which one
interpretation often fails to exhaust. A prophecy may have a reference
to something at the time of its utterance. It may wait for its final
fulfilment in the remote future. And there may be an application to the
time between these two limits. Hence the Futurist and Prrterist
interpretations are both true, in so far as they are each a part of the
truth. But they are each wrong when the one is put for the other, and a
part is put for the whole.
