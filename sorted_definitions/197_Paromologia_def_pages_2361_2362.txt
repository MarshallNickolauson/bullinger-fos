Paromologia; or, Confession

A Concession in Argument to gain Favour

Par-o-mo-log’-i-a. Greek, παροµολογία, confession, from παρά (para),
by, or near, and ὁμολογεῖν (homologein), to confess.

This Figure is used when we acknowledge some fault or wrong

with a view to gain favour. Hence the Latins called it CONFESSIO,
confession, acknowledgment.
