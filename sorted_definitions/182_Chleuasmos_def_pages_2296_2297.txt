Chleuasmos; or, Mocking

An Expression of Feeling by Mocking and Jeering

Chleu-as’-mos. Greek, Χλευασμµός, mocking, scoffing, sneering,
Jeering, from Χλεύη (chleuee), a jest, and χλευάζω (chleuaz6), to make
a jest of, scoff at.
EPLCERTOMESIS, Greek, ἐπικερτόμησις (Ep-i-ker-to-mee-sis), a
sneering or jeering.

MYCTERISMOS, Greek, µυκτηρισµός (muk-teer-is-mos), a turning
up of the nose at, sneering, or snuffing, from µυκτήρ (mukteer), the
nose, snout, nostrils.

The figure is used when the speaker or writer excites laughter by a
jeer or sneer; or excites ridicule by turning up the nose.

This is exactly what the Holy Spirit says the Pharisees did at the
Lord’s teaching in Luk. 16:14, and which led Him to rebuke them, and
put them to shame and silence by a parable similar to those they were
fond of using (See Lightfoot).

It is also what Jehovah will do, in return, to those who have thus
treated His Anointed.
