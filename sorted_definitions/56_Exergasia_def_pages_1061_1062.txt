Exergasia: or, Working Out

A Repetition, so as to work out or illustrate what has already been said

Ex-er-ga’-si-a. Greek, ἐξεργασία, which means a working out (from ἐξ
(ex), out, and ἐργάζομαι (ergazomai), to work.
In this figure the same thought, idea, or subject is repeated in
other words, and thus worked out and developed. It, therefore,
resembles Synonymia; but differs from it in that not merely
synonymous words are repeated, but synonymous expressions or
sense.

It is sometimes called EPEXERGASIA, i.e., the addition of the
preposition ἐπί (epi), upon, to the word exergasia and implies a
working out upon. Words of the same signification are repeated to
make plainer the previous statement: or to illustrate the sense of what
has been mentioned before.

The Latins called it EXPOLITIO. a polishing up; because by such
repetition the meaning is embellished as well as strengthened and not
merely explained or interpreted as in other repetitions.

This figure necessarily implies that the separate repetitions must
be placed in parallel lines.
