Symperasma; or, Concluding Summary

Addition of Conclusion by way of a brief Summary

Sym’-per-as’-ma (συμπέρασμα), a finishing or end. In logic it is the
conclusion of a syllogism. It is from σύν (sun), together with, and
περαιόω (peraio?), to carry over or across-

Hence, Symperasma means to conclude along with, to end
together, and is used when what has been said is briefly summed up,
and when certain foregoing enumerations are given in a brief epitome.

It is called also ATHRCESMOS (a-throes’-mos), from ἀθροίξω
(athroiz?), to collect or gather together.

It differs from Synathroesmus (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ) in that it is
used at the end and as the conclusion of what has been before said,
and not in the course, and as part of the statement.
