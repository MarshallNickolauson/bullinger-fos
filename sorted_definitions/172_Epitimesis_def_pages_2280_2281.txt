Epitimesis; or, Reprimand

An Expression of Feeling by way of Censure, Reproof, or Reproach

Ep ’-i-ti-mee’-sis. Greek, ἐπιτίμησις, reproof, reprimand, from ἐπιτιμάω.
(epitimao), to put a price upon, from τιµή (timee), worth or value.

It is also called EPIPLEXIS, ep’-i-pleex’-is. Greek, ἐπίπληξις,
chastisement, punishment, blame.

The figure is used, where a rebuke, reproof, or reproach is
conveyed.

Seeing that God’s ways and thoughts are the opposite of man’s, it
is impossible that God should speak to man without many rebukes
and reproaches.

These are of various kinds; and some have their own special
names, as will be seen below.

We give merely one or two by way of example, and as showing
what we may learn from them.
