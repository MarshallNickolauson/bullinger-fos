Hypallage; or, Interchange

Interchange of Construction

Hy-pal’-la-gee, ὑπαλλαγή, from ὑπό (hypo), under, and ἀλλάσσειν
(allassein), to change. An underchange or interchange.

Hypallage differs from Antiptosis in that it relates to an interchange
of construction whereby an adjective or other word, which /ogically
belongs to one connexion, is grammatically united with another, so
that what is said of or attributed to one thing ought to be said of or
attributed to the other.

In the case of two nouns (the latter in regimen), they are
interchanged in sense, not as in Antiptosis (where the former
becomes an adjective instead of the latter), but they are reversed in
order or construction without regard to the purely adjectival sense.

Shakespeare makes Cassius say of Julius Caesar:

“His coward lips did from their colour fly.”

Instead of “the colour did fly from his coward lips.”

This interchange attracts attraction to what is said, and thus
emphasizes the true and real meaning.
