Parecbasis; or, Digression

A temporary Turning Aside from one Subject to another

Par-ek’-ba-sis. Greek, παρέκβασις, a digression, from παρα (para),
beside, ἐκ (ek), out of, or from, and βάσις (basis), a stepping (from
βαΐνειν (bainein), to step).

A figure by which the speaker or writer steps from beside his
subject, and makes a digression, changing his subject-matter, and
adding something beyond the scope of his subject, though necessary
to it. Sometimes this digression is mentioned, and a promise given to
return to it again.
The figure was hence called by the Latins DIGRESSIO, or
digression, and was known by other names among the Greeks:-

PARABASIS (par-ab’-a-sis), from the above roots, a stepping
aside.

ECBOLE. Greek, ἐκβολή (ec’-bo-lee), a throwing out, from ἐκ (ek),
out, and βάλλειν (ballein), to throw: hence, a digression in which a
person is introduced speaking (or throwing out) his own words.

APHODOS. Greek, ἄφοδος (aph-od’-os), a going away from, from
ἀπό (apo), away from, and ὅδος (hodos), a way.

The nature of this figure therefore is clear; and examples are not
wanting in Scripture.

It is more than a mere Parenthesis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ): being
a digression to quite a different subject.
A parenthesis is really part of the same subject, but Parecbasis is
a stepping aside to another.
