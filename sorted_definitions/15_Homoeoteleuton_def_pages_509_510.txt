Homeeoteleuton; or, Like Endings

The Repetition of the same Letters or Syllables at the end of
Successive Words
Hepr-moe-o-tel-eu’-ton. From ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and Τελευτή
(teleutee), an ending, i.e., words with like endings.

This is the opposite Figure to Homoeopropheron; and is used
when successive words end with the same or similar letters or
syllables.

These two figures are for the most part involved in others which
affect the whole of the connected words; and therefore we shall meet
with other examples as we proceed.
