Eleutheria; or, Candour

An Expression of Feeling by way of bold Freedom of Speech in
Reprehension

El-eu’-ther-i’-a. Greek, ἐλευθερία, liberty or licence. Hence,
ἐλευθέριος, (eleutherios), speaking or acting like a free man, frank.
The figure is so called, because the speaker or writer, without
intending offence, speaks with perfect freedom and boldness.
Eleutheria is therefore the bold reprehension of free speech.
It is called PARRHESIA (Par-rhee’-si-a). Greek, παρρησία, free
spokenness, openness, boldness, frankness.

The Latins called it LICENTIA, licence.
