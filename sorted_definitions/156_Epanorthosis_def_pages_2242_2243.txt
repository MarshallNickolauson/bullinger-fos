Epanorthosis; or, Correction

A Recalling of what has been said, in order to correct it as by an
Afterthought

Ep’-a-nor-thé-sis. Greek, ἐπανόρθωσις, from ἐπί (epi), upon, ava
(ana), up or again, and ὀρθοῦν (orthoun), to set straight (from ὀρθός
(orthos), straight).
Hence Epanorthosis means a setting upright again.
The figure is so called when a writer or speaker has said
something, and immediately recalls it in order to substitute something
better, or stronger, or weightier, in its place, thus correcting what has
been said. Hence the Latins called this figure CORRECTIO,
correction.

The Greeks had other names for it, owing to its beauty and power,
and also to the frequency of its employment. They called it

DIORTHOSIS (di-or-thé‘-sis), from διά (dia), through, and ὀρθοῦν.
(orthoun), to set straight.

EPIDIORTHOSIS (ep ‘-i-di-or-th6‘-sis). The above name with ἐτή
(epi), upon, prefixed.

METANCEA (met’-a-noe-a), an after-thought, from µετανοέω (meta-
поеб), to change one’s mind.

Epanorthosis is of three kinds:

1. Where the retraction is absolute.
2. Where it is partial or relative.
3. Where it is conditional.
