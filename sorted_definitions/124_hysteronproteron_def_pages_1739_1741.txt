Hysteron-Proteron; or, Last-First

The Second of two things put First

Hys’-te-ron - Prot’-e-ron, τοπ!) | (hysteros), the latter, and ©) !>!
(proteros), the former.

A figure in which the word that should be the latter of two words
comes first.

It is, therefore, a kind of Hyperbaton: where ‘the cart is put before
the horse.’ It occurs in most languages; but it is a question whether in
this sense it occurs in the Bible, as the figure is considered rather a
blemish than an ornament. If it is used, it is certainly for unusual
emphasis.

Php. 3:19 has been cited: “Whose end is destruction, whose God is
their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly
things.”

Here, the “end” is put first: in order that the mind may dwell with
the greater horror on the things which lead to it.
The structure of these verses (18, 19) throws more light on them,
and shows that after the words “many walk” there is a parenthetical
break, which is resumed at the end of verse 19, to show who these
“walkers” are, viz., “the earthly minded.”

а “For many are walking

b Whom | often told you, and do tell you now-even weeping,
calling them the enemies of the cross of Christ,

b Whose end-destruction; whose god-the belly; and their
glory-in shame.

a Such [namely] as are minding earthly things.”

Here, in “a” and “a” we have the walkers; while in “b” we have their
walk, and in “b” their end. Hence their walk ends in destruction, their
worship ends in their belly, and their glory ends in shame.
