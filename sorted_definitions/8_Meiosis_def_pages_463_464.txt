Meiosis: or, A Be-Littleing

(A be-littleing of one thing to magnify another)
Mei-??-sis. Greek µείωσις, a lessening, or diminution: from µειόω
(mei-o-?), to make smaller.

It is known also by the name LITOTES, /i’-to-tees: Greek λιότης,
plainness, simplicity.

The Latins called it DIMINUTIO (Di-mi-nu-ti-o) and EXTENUATIO
(Ex-ten’-u-a’-ti-o).

By this figure one thing is diminished in order to increase another
thing. It thus differs from Tapeinosis (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ), in which
a thing is lessened in order to emphasize its own greatness or
importance.

In Meiosis there is an omission therefore, not of words, but of
sense. One thing is lowered in order to magnify and intensify
something else by way of contrast.

It is used for the purpose of emphasis; to call our attention, not to
the smallness of the thing thus lessened, but to the importance of that
which is put in contrast with it.
