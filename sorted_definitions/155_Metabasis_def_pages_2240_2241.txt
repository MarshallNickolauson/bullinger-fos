Metabasis; or, Transition

A passing from one subject to another

Me-tab’-a-sis. Greek, µετάβασις, from µετά (meta), beyond or over,
and βαΐνειν (bainein), to step or go, a stepping from one thing to
another.
Hence, called by the Latins, TRANSITIO, transition, and
INTERFACTIO, a doing or putting a thing in between, as in passing
from one thing to another.

The figure is used when the speaker or writer passes from one
thing to another by reminding his hearers or readers of what has been
said, and only hinting at what might be said, or remains to be said.

Sometimes, however, it is used of an abrupt transition.
