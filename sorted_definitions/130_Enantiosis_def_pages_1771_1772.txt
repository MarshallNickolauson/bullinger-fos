Enantiosis; or, contraries

Affirmation or Negation by Contraries

E-nan-ti-o??-sis. Greek, 211 from Â©' | | (enantios), opposite.
The figure Antithesis is called Enantiosis when the contrast is
expressed by affirmatives and negatives. What is stated affirmatively
is meant negatively, or vice versa. When it is stated both ways, it is a
kind of Pleonasm (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). The difference being that
Pleonasm refers to any statement, while Enantiosis refers to
affirmation by contraries.
