Antiphrasis; or, Permutation: i.e., A New Name for the Old Thing

A new and opposite Name for a thing after the original Meaning has
ceased.

An-tiph’-ra-sis. Greek, ἀνήφρασις, from ἀντιφράζειν (antiphrazein), to
express by antithesis or negation; from @мт (anti), against, and
φράζειν (phrazein). Hence, φράσις (phrasis), a way of speaking. The
figure is so called, because a word or phrase is used in a sense
opposite to its original and proper signification; the figure is thus one
of change: the name of a thing or subject being changed to the
opposite, in order to emphasize some important fact or circumstance,
as when a court of justice was once called “a court of vengeance.”

It thus partakes of, and is indeed a species of, /rony (α.ν. [Note:
Which see.] ). The difference is that Antiphrasis is used only of single
words or phrases, while /rony is used of connected sentences.
Another difference is that Antiphrasis affects rather the meaning of
words, while /rony affects the application of words.

Hence Antiphrasis is called, by the Latins, PERMUTATIO, or
permutation, because of this change of meaning.
