Dialogismos; or, Dialogue

Dj-al-o-gis-mos. Greek, διαλογισµός, conversation, arguing, from
διαλογίζεσθαι (dialogizesthai), to converse, argue.

This figure is used when we represent one or more persons as
speaking about a thing, instead of saying it ourselves: Dialogue.

The persons speak in a manner suitable to their character or
condition.

When there are not two persons represented, but the objecting
and answering is done by the one speaker, the figure is called
LOGISMUS, and what is stated is said to be in dialogismo, or in
logismo.

Sometimes the speaker brings forward another as speaking, and
uses his words, adapting them to the object in view.

The Latins called this figure SERMOCINATIO, which means the
same thing.
