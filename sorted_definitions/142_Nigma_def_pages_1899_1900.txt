Nigma; or, Dark Saying

A. Truth expressed in obscure Language

E-nig’-ma. Greek, αἴνιγμα (ai-nig-ma), from αἰνίσσεσθαι (ainissesthai),
to tell a strange tale, then to speak darkly or in riddles. Hence an
enigma is a dark or obscure saying, a puzzling statement or action. A
statement of which the meaning has to be searched for in order to be
discovered.

Enigma thus differs from Parable, in that the latter is generally
explained. When a Parable is without any explanation, it may be
called an Enigma, i.e., a dark or obscure saying.
