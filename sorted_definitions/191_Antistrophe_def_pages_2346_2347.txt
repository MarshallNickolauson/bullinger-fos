Antistrophe; or, Retort

A turning the Words of a Speaker against himself

An-tis-tro-phee. Greek, ἀντιστροφή, a turning about, from avti (anti),
against, and στρέφω (strepho), to turn.
The figure is so called because the words of a speaker are turned
against himself in Retort.

When the retort is violent, it is called BION (Bi-ae-on), Greek,
Βίαιον, forcible, violent, compulsory.

Hence the Latin, VIOLENTUM, violent, and INVERSIO, inversion,
a turning against.
