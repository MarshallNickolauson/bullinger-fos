Prolepsis (Occupatio); or, Anticipation

The answering of an Argument by anticipating it before it is used
Pro-leep’-sis. Greek, TpOANWic, a taking beforehand, from πρό (pro),
beforehand, and λαμβάνειν (lambanein), to take or receive.

This is a beautiful figure; by which we anticipate objections to what
we are stating.

The other general names of this figure are:

PROCATALEPSIS (Pro -cat-a-leep-sis). Greek, προκατάληψις, а
seizing beforehand, pre-occupation.

APANTESIS (Ap -an-tee’-sis). Greek, ἁπάντησις, a meeting;
hence a meeting of an objection by anticipation.

The Latins called it:

OCCUPATIO, anticipation.

ANTEOCCUPATIO, anticipation beforehand.

PRMONITIO, a defending beforehand, obviating objections.
All these different names show us the importance of the figure in
argumentation.

There is another kind of Prolepsis, which has to do only with time.
It is distinguished from our present figure in that while it anticipates
and speaks of future things as present it really adjourns the
application of the words, and is called AMPLIATIO, or adjournment.
(See pages 689 and 914).

The form of Prolepsis which we are considering is an anticipation
which has to do with Argumentation; and hence is distinguished from
the other by the word OCCUPATIO: i.e., we not only anticipate what is
coming, but occupy and deal with it, instead of adjourning or Putting it
off. See Section 4, above.

Prolepsis, as relating to Argumentation is of two kinds: (i.) Tecta,
or, closed; and (ii.) Aperta, or, open.

I. Tecta, or Closed Prolepsis, is where the anticipated objection

is merely stated or implied, not answered; or answered, but not
plainly stated.

II. Aperta, or Open Prolepsis, is where the anticipated objection

is both answered and stated.

We will consider these in order with the different names which
have been given to them.
