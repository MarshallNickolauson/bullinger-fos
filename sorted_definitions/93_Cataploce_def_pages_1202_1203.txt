Cataploce; or, Sudden Exclamation

Parenthetic Addition by Way of Exclamation

Cat’-a-plok’-ee (καταπλοκή), from κατά (kata), down, and πλοκή
(plokee), a twining or plaiting. The figure is so called because the
short sentence so interposed is intertwined with another. This name is
given to a parenthesis when it takes the form of a sudden
exclamation.
