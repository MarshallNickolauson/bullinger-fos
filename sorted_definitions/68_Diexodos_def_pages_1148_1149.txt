Diexodos; or, Expansion

A lengthening out by copious Exposition of Facts

When Synathroesmos is used of facts, etc., instead of single words or
things, it is called DIEXODOS (Di-ex’-od-os), a way out through, from
διά (dia), through; ἐξ (ex), out of; and ὁδός (hodos), a way-

The figure is employed when there is a copious statement or
exposition of facts, not so much for the purpose of amplification, or of
abbreviation, as of digression. Indeed, it is the opposite of Syntomia:
which means a cutting off short, abridgment: whereas Diexodos is a
lengthening out by a digression in order to expand.
