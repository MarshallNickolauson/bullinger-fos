Pathopeela; or, Pathos

The Expression of Feeling or Emotion

Path’-o-poe-i-a. Greek, паботпойа, from πάθος (pathos), a feeling or
passion, and ποιεῖν (poiein), to make.

This figure is so called, because the writer or speaker manifests
some pathos or emotion: or betrays some strong and excited condition
of mind.

It is of four kinds:-

Two arising out of pleasure: love and joy. And
Two arising out of pain: hatred and sorrow.
