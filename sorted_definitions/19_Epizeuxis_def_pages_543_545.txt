Epizeuxis: or, Duplication

The Repetition of the Same Word in the Same Sense
When the word is repeated in close and immediate succession, no
other word or words coming between, it is called GEMINATIO,
pronounced Gem-i-ner-tio, which means a doubling, duplication, a re-
doubling. № is also called ITERATIO  (lér-er-e-ti-o), iteration;
CONDUPLICATIO (con-dbi-pli-car-tio), conduplication, or full doubling.
When the words do not immediately succeed each other, but are
separated by one or more intervening words, the figure is then called
EPIZEUXIS, pronounced Ер --геих -is. It is the Greek word ἐπήζευξις,
from ἐτῆ (epi), upon, and ζεύγνυμµί (zeugnumi), to yoke, or join closely
together. The intervening words thus form the yoke which joins the
repeated words.

The Latins give this figure the name of SUBJUNCTIO (Subjunc-
tio), which is derived from the Greek and has exactly the same
meaning, subjoining (from jugum, a yoke).

We may give the figure the English name of “Duplication,”
“Gemination,” “Iteration,” or “Repetition.”

It is a common and powerful way of emphasizing a particular word,
by thus marking it and calling attention to it.

In writing, one might accomplish this by putting the word in larger
letters, or by underlining it two or three times. In speaking, it is easy to
mark it by expressing it with increased emphasis or vehemence.

How important for us to notice, in the Scriptures, the words and
expressions which the Holy Spirit has thus marked and emphasized in
order to impress us with their importance!
