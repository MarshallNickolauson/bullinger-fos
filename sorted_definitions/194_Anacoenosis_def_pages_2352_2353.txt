Anaccenosis; or, Common Cause

An Appeal to others as having interests in Common

An‘-a-coe-né-sis. Greek, ἀνακοίΐνωσις (anakoinosis), from ανακοινοῦν
(anakoinoun), to communicate; from ava (ana), up, and κοινοῦν
(koinoun), to make common (from κοινός, koinos, common).

A Figure by which a speaker appeals to his opponents for their
opinion, as having a common interest in the matter in question: as, “If
the case were yours, how would you act?” or “What do you think about
it?” or “What would you say?”

The Greeks also called it SYMBOULESIS (sym-boul-ee’-sis,
συµβόυλησις, a counselling together: from σύν (sun or syn), together,
and βουλή, a counselling. Hence, βουλεύμεσθαι (bouleuesthai), to
deliberate.

The Latins called it COMMUNICATIO, a making common.

The figure is an appeal to the feelings or opinions of others, which
they have in common with ourselves, and to which we submit the
matter.

When this is done by way of question, it is a form of Erotesis (q.v.
[Note: Which 5εε.]).
