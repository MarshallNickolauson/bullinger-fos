Topographia; or, Description of Place

Top’-o-graph а, from τόπος (top’-os), a place, and урафем
(graphein), to write or describe.

Hence it is used of the figure which adds something to what is said
by describing a place; or any peculiarity which marks the place, and
throws light on what is being treated of.

Called by the Latins LOCI DESCRIPTIO.
