Syllepsis; or, Combination

The Repetition of the Sense without the Repetition of the Word
Syl-lep’-sis, from σύν (sun), together with, and λῆψις (leepsis) a
taking.

This name is given to the figure when only one word is used, and
yet it takes on two meanings at the same time.

The word itself is used only once; and ought to be, but is not
repeated in the next clause, being omitted by Ellipsis (q.v. [Note:
Which see.] ), but the two meanings are taken together with the one
word.

It is called SYNESIS (Syn’-e-sis), a joining or meeting together,
and SYNTHESIS (Syn -the-sis), a putting together, compounding,
from σύν (sun), together, and Τίθηµι (titheemi), to put or place.

The Syllepsis here considered is rhetorical rather than
grammatical (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). There is a form of Syllepsis
which involves change rather than addition. It will be found therefore
under those figures in our third division.
