Antanaclasis: or, Word-Clashing

Repetition of the same Word in the same Sentence, with Different
Meanings

Ant’-an-a-cla‘-sis, from ἀντί (anti), against or back, avd (ana), up, and
κλάσις (klasis), a breaking from κλάω (klaqb), to break. Hence, a
breaking up against. This name is given to this figure; because, when
a word has been used once in a sentence in its plain and natural
sense, it is used again in the same sentence in another sense which
breaks up against it. It is the use of the same word in the same
sentence in two different senses. It is essential to this figure that the
two words must be the same in spelling.* [Note: This differs from a
Homonym (see Appendix D), which is a different word though spelt in
the same way.] When they are similar in spelling but alike in sound,
the figure is known by another name, Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which
see] ).

It is in frequent use in all languages: e.g., “while we live, let us
live”: or “learn some craft while you are young that when you are old
you may live without craft.”

When the Declaration of American Independence was being
signed, Hancock said, “We must be unanimous; there must be no
pulling different ways.” “Yes,” said Franklin, “we must all hang
together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.”

A correspondent recently wrote concerning a certain subject: “The
more | think of it the less | think of it,” where the meaning is obvious.
