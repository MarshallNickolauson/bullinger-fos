Deprecatio; or, Deprecation

An Expression of Feeling by way of Deprecation

Dep-re-caâ€™-ti-o. The name of this figure is from the Latin, and means
literally a praying against, an act of deprecation.

The figure is used in three senses:-

(1) A praying against evil, so as to avert or prevent its results: as
when an Advocate pleads former good character, etc., on behalf of the
accused person.

(2) Where the speaker prays against others, that evil may fall upon
them;or even against himself. This is properly IMPRECATION.

(3) When the ejaculatory prayer is for the prevention or removal of
any evil generally.
