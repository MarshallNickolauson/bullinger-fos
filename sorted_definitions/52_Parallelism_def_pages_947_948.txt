Parallelism; or, Parallel Lines

The Repetition of similar, synonymous, or opposite Thoughts or Words
in parallel or successive Lines

This form of sacred writing has been noted from the earliest times. De
Rossi,* [Note: Kitto. Bib. Cyc. Ill. 702.] a learned Jew of the sixteenth
century, first published a mass of information on the subject in a
remarkable work, Meor Enajim (i.e., The Light of the Eyes). Bishop
Lowth translated chapter 60+ [Note: Lowthâ€™s Translation of Isaiah,
Prel. Dis. p. xxviii. (15th Ed. 1857).] , which deals with the construction
of lines: and Bishop Jebb in his Sacred Literature extended the study.
But none of these got beyond Parallelism as it is applied to lines. This
has universally gone under the name of, and been treated as, Poetry.

It is a form of the figure Synonymia, by which the subject of one
line is repeated in the next line in different, but so-called, synonymous
terms.

Parallelism is of seven kinds: three simple and four complex:-

I. Simple.
1. Synonymous or Gradational.
2. Antithetic or Opposite.
3. Synthetic or Constructive.
II. Complex.
1. Alternate. Two lines repeated only once (four lines in all).
2. Repeated Alternation. Two lines repeated more than once.
3. Extended Alternation. Three or more lines repeated.
4. Introverted.
