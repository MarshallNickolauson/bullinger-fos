Tapeinosis; or, Demeaning

(A lessening of a thing in order to increase it)
Ta-pei-n??-sis. Greek ταπείνωσις, a demeaning or humbling.

This differs from Meiosis in that in Meiosis one thing is diminished
in order, by contrast, to increase the greatness of another, or
something else.

Whereas, in Tapeinosis the thing that is lessened is the same thing
which is increased and intensified.

The figure was also called ANTENANTIOSIS. Ant’-en-an-ti-o -sis
from амт! (anti), over against, or instead of, and ἐναντίος (enantios),
opposite.

When the figure is used parenthetically, it is called ANRESIS. See
below under Parenthesis.

The figure is used in connection with nouns, verbs, and adverbs,

1. Positively.

2. Negatively.
