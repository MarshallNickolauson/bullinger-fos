Metastasis; or, Counter-Blame

A transferring of the Blame from one’s self to another

Me-tas’-ta-sis. Greek, µετάστασις, from µετά (meta), beyond, over,
and στάσις, a standing or placing (from ἱστάναι (histanai), to put or
place).
Hence, Metastasis means a placing beyond: {6., a transferring.

Hence called by the Latins TRANSLATIO, a translating.

The Figure is so called because it is a transferring of blame from
one person or thing to another.
