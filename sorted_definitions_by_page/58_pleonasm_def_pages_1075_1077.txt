Pleonasm; or, Redundancy

When more Words are used than the Grammar requires

Ple’-o-nasm. Greek, πλεονασμµός (pleonasmos): from πλέονάζειν
(pleonazein), to be more than enough. This is from πλέος (pleon), or
πλεῖον (pleion), more, and πλέος (pleos), full. We have it in our words
complete, plenitude, replete, etc.

The figure is so called when there appears to be a redundancy of
words in a sentence; and the sense is grammatically complete without
them. Sometimes the substantive appears to be redundant when its
idea is already implied in the adjective; or when two nouns are used
where one appears to be sufficient.

But this redundancy is only apparent. These words are not really
superfluous when used by the Holy Spirit, nor are they idle or useless.
They are necessary to fill up the sense, which without them would be
incomplete and imperfect.

This figure is used to set forth the subject more fully by repeating it
in other, sometimes in opposite, terms. What is first expressed
affirmatively is sometimes repeated negatively, and vice versa. It is
also used for the purpose of marking the emphasis; or, for intensifying
the feeling; or, for enhancing in some way what has been already said.
The term pleonastic may therefore be applied to all similar figures of
repetition or addition. But we have endeavoured to classify them
according to the object in view in the repetition; whether it be
definition, or interpretation, or for mere emphasis by amplification, etc.

We have reserved the term pleonasm for this latter class, where
what is said is immediately after put in another or opposite way to
make it impossible for the sense to be missed; and thus to emphasize
it.

The figure may affect words, or sentences. We have therefore
arranged the examples as follows:
I. Words.
1. Certain idiomatic words.
2. Other words.
II. Sentences.
1. Affirmative.
2. Negative.
