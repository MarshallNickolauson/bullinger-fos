Paromeeosis: or, Like-Sounding Inflections

The Repetition of Inflections similar in Sound

Par’-o-moe-o-sis. Greek, παροµοίωσις, assimilation, especially of
words; assonance. It is from παρά (para), beside, and ὅμοιωσις
(homoosis), likeness.

It is called also PAROMCEON, παρόµοιον, nearly like.
Sometimes it is wrongly called Parechesis, παρήχησις, likeness of
sound or tone, from παρά, beside, and ἦχος (eechos), a sound, or
ἤχησις (eecheesis), a sounding. But Parechesis properly describes
the figure when one of the two words belongs to another language, or
when the similarity is seen only in the original language and not in the
translation. See Parechesis.
