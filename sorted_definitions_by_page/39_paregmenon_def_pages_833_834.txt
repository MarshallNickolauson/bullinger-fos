Paregmenon; or, Derivation

The Repetition of Words derived from the same Root
Pa-reg’-me-non, from παρά (para), beside or along, ἄγειν (agein), to
lead.

In this figure the repeated words are derived from the same root.
Hence, the name Paregmenon is used of the Figure when the words
are similar in origin and sound, but not similar in sense.

The Latins called it DERIVATIO.

This is one of the Figures common to all languages, but is
generally very difficult to translate from one tongue into another.
