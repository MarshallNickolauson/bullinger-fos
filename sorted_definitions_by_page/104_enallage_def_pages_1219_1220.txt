Enallage; or, Exchange

Exchange of one Word for another

E-nal’-la-gee, ἑναλλαγή, an exchange, from ἐἑναλλάσσειν
(enallassein), to exchange, from ἐν (en), in, and ἀλλάσσειν (allassein),
to change.

Enallage is a figure of grammar; and consists of an exchange of
words, or a substitution of one word for another. It differs from
Metonymy (α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ) in that Metonymy is the exchange
or substitution of one noun for another noun: while Enallage is a
change of one part of speech for another (Antimeria); or one tense,
mood, person, or number for another (Heterosis); or one case for
another (Antiptosis), but never of one noun for another.

It is also called ENALLAXIS (ἐνάλλαξις, e-nal-lax’-is), from another
part of the same verb as Enallage, and with the same meaning, an
exchange.

Also ALLQEGOSIS (ἀλλοίωσις, alloi-q-sis), a change, or
alteration, from ἀλλοιόω (айоюф), to make different, to change.
Enallage consists of the following forms:
Antimereia,

Antiptosis,

Heterousis, and

Hypallage’, which will be considered in order.
