Apodioxis; or, Detestation

An Expression of Feeling by way of Detestation

Ap ‘-o-di-6x’-is. Greek, aTrodiwéic, a chasing away; from ἁπό (apo),
away from, and διώκειν (αἰδκείη), to pursue.

The figure is so called, because the speaker or writer repels
something, and spurns it as absurd or wicked.

The Latins called it REJECTIO, a rejecting or rejection;
DETESTATIO, a detesting or detestation; and ABOMINATIO, an
abominating or abomination.
