Synonymia; or, Synonymous Words

The Repetition of Words similar in Sense, but different in Sound and
Origin

Syn-o-nym -i-a, from σύν (sun), together with, and ὄνομα (onoma), а
name. A Synonym is so Called when the sense of two or more words
is similar, though the sound and appearance and derivation may be
quite different. Synonyms do not make the figure called Synonymia
unless they are used for the purpose of enhancing the force and fire of
the passage.

The Figure of Synonymia is a repetition of words different in sound
and origin, but similar in shades of meaning. When used rhetorically-
repeating the same sentence in other words-it has a variety of uses, to
which distinct names have been given according to the nature of the
subject, or the object of the speaker. See below under the next section
(Section ΙΙ., Repetition, affecting the sense).

Synonymia, when employed by man, is often an unnecessary and
vain repetition of empty words; but, when used by the Holy Spirit, it
causes the mind to look again and again at the subject. Man may use
it to expose his unhappy vanity: but God uses it to emphasize His
wisdom, power, or purpose, when words of similar meaning are
heaped together to attract the attention, and impress the mind.

We have not, except in a few important instances, attempted to
define the various Synonyms employed. This is a work by itself, and
will well repay the most patient and careful study.
