AmecebZon; or, Refrain

The Repetition of the same Phrase at the End of successive
Paragraphs

Am-ce-bf-on. № is from the Greek ἁμοιβή (amoibee), change,
alteration (from ἁμείβειν (ameibein), to change. It is used of the
repetition of the same phrase or sentence, where it occurs in poetry at
the end of successive periods.

Cycloides may occur at the beginning, or middle, or any part of the
circle, but AmoebZon only at the end.

This burden, therefore, thus emphasized is the main point for us to
notice in what is being said.
