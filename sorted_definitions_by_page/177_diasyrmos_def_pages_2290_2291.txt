Diasyrmos; or, Raillery

An Expression of Feeling by way of tearing away Disguise

Di’-a-syrm-os. Greek, διασυρµός, a tearing in pieces, from διασύρειν
(diasurein); and this from διά (dia) and σύρειν (surein), to drag, to
force away.

Twice the word is used in connection with Paul: Act. 8:3, “haltug”;
and Act. 14:19, “drew.”

This figure is so called, because it tears away the veil, or whatever
may be covering the real matter in question, and shows it up as it
really is. Hence, raillery which tears away all disguise.
