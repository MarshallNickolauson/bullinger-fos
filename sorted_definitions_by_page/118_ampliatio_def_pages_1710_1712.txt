Ampliatio; or, Adjournment: i.е., an Old Name for a New Thing

A retaining of an old Name after the reason for it is passed away
Am -pli-a’-ti-o is a figure discovered and named by the Latins. It is
from am’-pli-o, to fill out, extend; hence, its more special and technical
sense, fo adjourn: i.e., to extend the time. So that Ampliatio means an
adjournment: and the name is given to this figure, because a name or
epithet is used of a subject either (1) before it has acquired the reason
for giving the name, or (2) after the reason has ceased.

In the latter case “the wolf’ is still spoken of as the wolf in
Millennial days, when its wolf's nature has been changed (Isa. 11:6):
and in the former the Saviour is so called by the angels while still an
infant (Luk. 2:11). This use of the figure is of the nature of Prolepsis
(q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).

Amopliatio thus differs from Amplificatio (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ),
though the two words are from the same root. The former has
reference to a change which has taken place; while in Amplificatio the
sense of a word or expression is made wider and expanded by a
repetition of the words in another form, in order to enlarge a narrative,
and to heighten or intensify what has already been said.

Ampliatio is thus a form of Epitheton (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ). The
original meaning of the figure is what is called permansive: i.e., the
name lives through the change which has taken place, and is still
used, though in a new sense.

There is a form of Prolepsis which is distinguished from Ampliatio,
(as opposed to Occupatio), but only as to time. It is a statement of
future things as though present, the real interpretation of them being
adjourned.

See under Prolepsis § 4 and § 6 of the last subdivision of Figures
involving Change.
