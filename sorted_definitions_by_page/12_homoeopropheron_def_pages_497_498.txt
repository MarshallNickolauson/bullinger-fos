Homeeopropheron; or, Alliteration

The Repetition of the same Letter or Syllable at the commencement of
Successive Words
Ho-mee-o-proph’-e-ron, from ὅμοιος (homoios), like, and προφέρω
(propherd), to carry, or place before: i.e., Successive words which
carry the same letter or the same syllable before, or at the beginning.
This figure, therefore, is the repetition of the same letter or syllable

at the beginning of two or more words in close succession. Its English
name is ALLITERATION (from ad, to, and litera, letter). Churchill
speaks of “Apt Alliteration’s Artful Aid.”
This figure is seen, of course, only in the Hebrew and the Greek. It
is difficult to reproduce it in a translation. And where it occurs in the
English it may be only accidental, and carry no weight or emphasis.
