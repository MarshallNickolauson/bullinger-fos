Hypocatastasis; or, Implication

A Declaration that implies the Resemblance or Representation; or
Comparison by Implication

Hy’-po-cat-as‘-ta-sis. Greek, ὑποκατάστασις, substitution or
implication; from ὑπό (hypo), underneath, κατά (kata), down, and
στάσις (stasis), a stationing. Hence, a putting down underneath.
As a figure, it differs from Metaphor, because in a metaphor the
two nouns are both named and given; while, in Hypocatastasis, only
one is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down
underneath out of sight. Hence Hypocatastasis is implied resemblance
or representation: i.e., an implied Simile or Metaphor. ΙΙ Metaphor is
more forcible than Simile, then Hypocatastasis is more forcible than
Metaphor, and expresses as it were the superlative degree of
resemblance.

For example, one may say to another, “You are like a beast.” This
would be Simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You are a
beast” that would be Metaphor. But, if he said simply, “Beast!” that
would be Hypocatastasis, for the other part of the Simile or Metaphor
(“you”), would be implied and not stated.

This figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract
and excite the attention to the greatest extent.

So well known was it to the ancients, that it received this
significant name. But it is, to-day, unmentioned by literary men, though
it is often unconsciously used by them. Thus, their language is
enriched by its use, while the figure is unknown, even by name!

What a proof of the sad neglect into which this great subject has
fallen; and what an example of the consequent loss which has
ensued.

This beautiful and far-reaching figure frequently occurs in
Scripture. The Lord Jesus Himself often used it, and that with
wondertul effect.

Its beauty and force will be at once seen, if we compare one or two
passages.
