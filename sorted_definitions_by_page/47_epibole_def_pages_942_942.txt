Epibole; or, Overlaid Repetition

The Repetition of the same Phrase at irregular Intervals

E-pi‘-bo-lee is from ἐπιβάλλειν (epiballein), to cast upon. The figure is
so named, because the same sentence or phrase is cast upon or laid
upon (like layers or courses of bricks) several successive paragraphs.

It thus differs from Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) in that it
consists of the repetition of several words, whereas in Anaphora only
one word is repeated.
