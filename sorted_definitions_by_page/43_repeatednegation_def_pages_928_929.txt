Repeated Negation; or, Many Noes

The Repetition of divers Negatives

This seems to deserve a place by itself, though the Greeks did not
classify it, or name it. They used it, however, and this is the all-
important point.

It is a special form of Synonymia, the synonyms being negatives of
different kinds heaped together for a special purpose.

Negatives are repeated even in English to strengthen and increase
the emphasis: just as we say “No, no,” “No, | will not.” But in the Greek
this is done much more emphatically. Two or more negatives are used
to strengthen the assertion.

These negatives are οὐ (ou) and µή (mee), which both equally
mean no or not.
As we are now considering their combined use we need not too
closely define their separate use. Otherwise we might enlarge on the
fact that the one, oU (ou), denies absolutely what is a matter of fact,
and negatives an affirmation: the other µή (mee) denies hypothetically
what is implied, and negatives a supposition.

This difference may be seen in such passages as 1Co. 2:14 (οὐ).
Joh. 3:18, where we have οὐ in the first sentence, and µή (both times)
in the second.
