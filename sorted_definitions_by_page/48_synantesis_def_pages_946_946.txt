Synantesis; or, Introverted Repetition

The Repetition of the same Sentences or Phrases in Inverse Order

Syn-an-tee-sis, from συναντάω (sunantaq), to meet face to face,
means a meeting.

It is similar to Epanodos and Antimetabole (q.v. [Note: Which see.]), 
but differs from them in that it relates to the inverse repetition of
sentences and phrases rather than of single words.

See, for examples, under Parallelism and Correspondence.
