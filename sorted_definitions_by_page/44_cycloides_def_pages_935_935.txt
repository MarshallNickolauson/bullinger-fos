Cycloides; or, Circular Repetition

The Repetition of the same Phrase at regular Intervals

Cy-clo-id’-es means having the form of a circle; from κύκλος (kuklos).
a circle, and εἶδος (eidos), form.

The figure is so called because the sentence or phrase is repeated
at intervals, as though in regular circles.

When this repetition occurs at the end of successive passages, as
in poetry, in the form of a Refrain or Burden, it is called AMCEBZON
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ). But when it occurs at the beginning or
middle or any other part of the passage it is called Cycloides.
