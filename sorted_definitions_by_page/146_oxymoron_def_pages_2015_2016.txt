Oxymoron; or, Wise-Folly

A Wise saying that seems Foolish

Ox’-y-m6’-ron. Greek, ὀξύμωρον, from ὀξύς (oxus), sharp, pointed,
and µωρός (méros), dull, foolish.

This is a figure, in which what is said at first sight appears to be
foolish, yet when we come to consider it, we find it exceedingly wise.

It is a smart saying, which unites words whose literal meanings
appear to be incongruous, if not contradictory; but they are so cleverly
and wisely joined together as to enhance the real sense of the words.
The Latins called it ACUTIFATUUM (a-cu -ti-fat-u-um), from acutus,
sharp or pointed (English, acute), and fatuus, foolish, fatuous, or
simple.
Examples from General Literature are common:-

Cicero says to Catiline:-

“Thy country, silent, thus addresses thee.”

Milton shows to Despair:-

“In the lowest depth a lower depth.”

Examples abound in common use: e.g., “cruel kindness”; “Festina
lente” (hasten slowly); “cruel love”; “blessed misfortunes.”

Many Americanisms are Oxymorons: e.g., “powerful weak,” “cruel
easy,” etc., etc.

The Scriptures have many examples: which are very instructive,
because God’s wisdom is esteemed foolish by man, and is yet so
wiseas to be far beyond his comprehension. This affords a wide field
for the use of this most expressive figure.
