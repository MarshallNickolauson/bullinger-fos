Metallage; or, a Changing Over

A different subject of thought substituted for the original subject
Me-tal’-la-gee. Greek µεταλλαγή, from µετά (meta), beyond, or across;
and ἀλλαγή (allagee), a change, exchange (from ἀλλάσσω, allasso).
Hence, Metallage means a taking over in exchange.

In this figure the word taken over is exchanged for a separate
object of thought.

The Latins called it SUPPOSITIO, substitution, and MATERIALIS,
the mother stuff: i.e., one material out of which something else is
made. The figure Metallage is used when a word is taken as the
material, and out of it another object of thought is made and
substituted.
