Apostrophe

A Turning Aside from the direct Subject-Matter to address others

A-pos’-tro-phe. Greek, ἁποστροφή, a turning away from, from ἁπό
(apo), away from, and στρέφειν (strephein), to turn.

The figure is so called when the speaker turns away from the real
auditory whom he is addressing, and speaks to an imaginary one. It is
a sudden breaking off in the course of speech, diverting it to some
new person or thing.

It is called also PROSPHONESIS (προσφώνησις, pros-ph6-neeo-
sis), an addressing one’s self to: from πρός (pros), to, and φωνεῖν
(ph nein), to speak.

Also by the Latins, AVERSIO, aversion, or a turning from.
