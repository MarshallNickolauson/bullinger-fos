Ccenotes; or, Combined Repetition

The Repetition of two different Phrases: one at the Beginning and the
Other at the End of successive Paragraphs

Cee’-no-tees. Greek, κοινότης (koinotees), sharing in common. The
figure is so called when two separate phrases are repeated, one at the
beginning and the other at the end of successive sentences or
paragraphs.

When only words are thus repeated, the figure is called Symploce
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), which is repeated Epanadiplosis.

It is a combination of Anaphora and Epistrophe; but, affecting
phrases rather than single words.

The Latins sometimes called this figure (as well as Symploce)
COMPLEXIO, combination.
