Aposiopesis; or, Sudden-Silence

This is a rhetorical figure, and not a figure of grammar, but it may be
placed under the figures depending on omission, because in it
something is omitted.

Apo-si-o-pee-sis is the Greek word ἁποσιώπησις (a becoming
silent), from ἀποσιωπάω (aposi?pa?), to be silent after speaking, to
keep silence, observe a deliberate silence.

The name of this figure may be represented in English by
SUDDEN-SILENCE. The Latins named it RETICENTIA, which means
the same thing. It is the sudden breaking off of what is being said (or
written), so that the mind may be the more impressed by what is too
wonderful, or solemn, or awful for words: or when a thing may be, as
we sometimes say, “better imagined than described.”

Its use is to call our attention to what is being said, for the purpose
of impressing us with its importance.

It has been divided under four heads, according to the character of
the subject:-

1. Promise.

2. Anger and Threatening.

3. Grief and Complaint.

4. Enquiry and Deprecation.
