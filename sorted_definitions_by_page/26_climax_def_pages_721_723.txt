Climax; or, Gradation

Repeated Anadiplosis

When Anadiplosis is repeated in successive sentences, it is called
Climax, from κλῖμαξ (klimax), a ladder, a gradual ascent, a going up by
steps.
Hence, in Latin, it is called SCALA, a ladder; GRADUS, a step; or,
GRADATIO, a gradation.

By some, it is called EPIPLOCE (e-pip -/o-ce), a folding upon.

There are two figures to which this name is sometimes given.
There is a climax where only words are concerned, and a climax
where the sense is concerned. A climax of words is a figure of
Grammar; and a climax of sense is a figure of Rhetoric. We have
confined our use of the word climax to the former; as there are other
names appropriated to the latter. A Climax in Rhetoric is known as
Anabasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), where the gradation is upward;
and Catabasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), where it is downward: and
these have other alternative titles. See below under figures of sense.

Climax relates to words; and is, as we have said, a repeated
Anadiplosis, or a combination of successive Anadiplosis and
Epanadiplosis: where the /ast word of one sentence is repeated as the
first word of the next, and the last of this next sentence is repeated as
the first word of the sentence following, and so on.

Sometimes there may be two or three words, only one of which is
repeated; or the repeated noun may be represented by a pronoun.

It is a beautiful figure, very expressive; and at once attracts our attention to the importance of a passage.
