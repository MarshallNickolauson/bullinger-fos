Syneeceiosis; or, Cohabitation

The Repetition of the same Word in the same Sentence with an
Extended Meaning
Syn’-oe-cei-o-sis from σύν (sun), together with, and οἰκείωσις
(οἰκείφςίς), dwelling in the same house.

This figure is so called because two words are used, and in the
general sense, but with a different and more extended signification.
They dwell together as it were in the same house; and yet, while one
speaker takes up the word and uses it in the same sense, he yet
means a different thing.

The Latins called it COHABITATIO, cohabitation, a dwelling
together.
