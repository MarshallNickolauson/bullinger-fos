Parechesls; or, Foreign Paronomasia

The Repetition of Words similar in Sound, but different in Language

Par-ee-che -sis. Greek, παρήξησις: from παρά (para), beside, and ἠξή
(eechee), a sound, a sounding of one word beside another.

Parechesis is a Paronomasia, when the repeated words of similar
sound are in another tongue.

The examples of Paronomasia which we have given are such only
in the Hebrew and the Greek, not in the English rendering of them
There is no figure in the English Translation; except when it may be
possible to reproduce the similar words in translation (as is done in
Rom. 10:19, disobedience and obedience, etc.). So far as the English
is concerned, and as related to it, all the examples of Paronomasia
are really Parechesis, because they exist in another language and not
in the translation of it.
Similarly, as the New Testament (if not originally written in Hebrew,
and then at a very early date translated into Greek) is at least full of
Hebrew thought and idiom. (See under Idiom.) So that, though there
may be no Paronomasia in the Greek words, there may be in the
Hebrew thought, or in the Hebrew words which the Greek words
represent. In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew
thought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And
it is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the
Hebrew words sounding beside the Greek words.

To put the difference in a simpler form: Two words similar in sound
are a Paronomasia with regard to their particular language, both
words being in the same language. But a Parechesis is found when
the two words are not in the same language.

The Greeks also called this figure

PAROMCEOSIS, from παρόμοιος, very much alike; and

PARISON or PARISOSIS, from παρά (para), beside, and ἴσος
(isos), equal to.

So that words equal to other words in one language are seen to be
similar to those in another language when placed beside them.
