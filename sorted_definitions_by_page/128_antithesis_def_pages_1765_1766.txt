Antithesis; or, Contrast

A setting of one Phrase in Contrast with another

An-tith’-e-sis. Greek, 2 |! =1T!, from © | (anti), against, and ‘ Г!
(thesis), a setting, from |. (tithenai), to set or place.

It is a figure by which two thoughts, ideas, or phrases, are set over
one against the other, in order to make the contrast more striking, and
thus to emphasize it.* [Note: When this consists of words rather than
of sentences, it is called Epanodos, and Antimetabole (q.v.).]

The two parts so placed are hence called in Greek antitheta, and
in Latin opposita and contraposita. For example:

“When our vices leave us, we flatter ourselves we leave them.”

“Curved is the line of beauty,
Straight is the line of duty.”

“The prodigal robs his heir, the miser robs himself.”

“God demands man’s homage; man offers Him his
patronage.”t [Note: Dr. Robert Anderson in The Silence of God.]

Man often misuses this figure, for the mere fancy of balancing
sentences; and thus often falsely exaggerates a contrast which lies
more in the words than in the thoughts. When this is the case it is
called Antimetabole, Parison, Annominatio, etc. (q.v. [Note: Which
see] ).

It is called also CONTENTIO: i.e., comparison, or contrast.

When this contrast is made by affirmatives and negatives, it is
called Enantiosis, see below.

The Book of Proverbs so abounds in such Antitheses that we have
not given any examples from it.
