Epanalepsis; or, Resumption

The repetition of the same word after a break, or parenthesis
Ep’-an-a-lep‘-sis. № is from the Greek ἐπί (epi), upon, ava (ana),
again, and Ajiwic (leepsis), a taking; and means a taking up upon
again.

In Latin it is called RESUMPTIO (Re-sump -tio).

In this figure the word is resumed, rather than repeated, from the
beginning of another sentence: and when the word is resumed after a
parenthesis it is called APOSTASIS, and the parenthesis is closed by
the apostasis.

A-pos’-ta-sis is from the Greek ἁπόστασις, which means a
standing away or off from, distance, interval; the repeated word which
resumes the statement or argument, standing away at a distance from
the first word.

Moreover, the word so taken up and resumed may not be
necessarily from the beginning of the sentence, but it may be taken up
again from the middle or from any other part, as in this sentence:-

“The persecutions undergone by the Apostles were a trial to their faith, and a
confirmation to ours; a trial to them,” etc.

It differs from Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) in that the
repeated words are not immediately successive, but are separated by
a break or parenthesis: the repetition being a resumption of what the
writer or speaker had already before begun to say.
