Synchoresis; or, Concession

Making a Concession of one Point to gain another

Syn’-ché-ree’-sis. Greek, συλχώρησις, concession, acquiescence,
consenting, from συγχωρέω (synchore6d), to come together, agree.

The figure is used when we make a concession of one point in
order to gain another. In this case the concession or admission is
made, and may be rightly made, in order to gain a point.

It thus differs from Epitrope (see below), where we admit
something that is wrong in itself for the sake of argument.

Synchoresis, therefore, is concession, while Epitrope is admission
or surrender.

The Latins called it CONCESSIO, concession, while the Greeks
had another name for it, EPICHORESIS (Ep~-i-ché-ree~-sis), an
agreement upon a point.
