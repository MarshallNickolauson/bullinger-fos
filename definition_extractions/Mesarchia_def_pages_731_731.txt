Mesarchia; or, Beginning and Middle Repetition

The Repetition of the same Word or Words at the beginning and
middle of successive Sentences
Mes-ar’-chi-a’, from the Greek µέσος (mesos), middle, and ἀρχή
(archee), beginning, because the same word or words are repeated at

the beginning and middle of successive sentences.

It differs little from Anaphora, where the sentences are
independent.

It resembles also Epizeuxis, when the repetition comes very close
together.
