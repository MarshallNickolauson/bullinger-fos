Symploce; or, Intertwining

The Repetition of different Words in successive Sentences in the
same Order and the same Sense

Sym -plo-kee’, from σύν (sun), together with, and πλοκή (plokee), a
folding. An intertwining of two different words in a similar order: one at
the beginning and the other at the end of successive sentences.

It is a combination of Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) and
Epistrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

The Latins called it COMPLEXIO, combination, and
COMPLICATIO, a folding together.

When phrases or sentences are thus repeated, instead of single
words, it is called Coenotes (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
Though there may be more than one word in the English, it does
not follow that there is more than one in the original.
