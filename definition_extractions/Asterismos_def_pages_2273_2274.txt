Asterismos; or, Indicating

The Calling Attention to by making a Star or Mark

As’-ter-is’-mos. Greek, ἁστερισμός, a calling of attention to a thing by
making an asterisk (from ἀστήρ, asteer, a star). A marking by putting a
star (* or ), in order to direct particular attention to a passage or
statement. Hence the figure is used when we employ (not an asterisk)
but some word, which answers the same purpose, in directing the eye
and the heart to some particular point or subject, such as “Lo!”
“Behold!”

As a concordance will furnish a complete list of these, it is not
necessary for us to give examples. We will only note that the word
“behold” is not a mere interjection, but is really a verb, telling us
actually to look and see, and observe and note attentively.

“Behold” seems to be specially the word used by the Holy Spirit
as the Inspirer of Scripture: while “Verily” (amen) is the word used by
the Lord Jesus; and “Yea” is the word of God the Father.
