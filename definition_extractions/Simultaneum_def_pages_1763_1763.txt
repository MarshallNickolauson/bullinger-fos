Simultaneum; or, Insertion

A parenthetic Insertion between the record of two simultaneous
Events

Si’-mul-ta’-ne-um. Latin, from simul, at the same time, together.

This figure is used when, in a description of events, properly
belonging to the same time, one is changed and put out of its
historical place, and put in between two others, which is thus divided
so as to take us by surprise.

It is, therefore, a kind of historical parenthesis, or logical Tmesis
(α.ν. [Note: Which зее.] ).
