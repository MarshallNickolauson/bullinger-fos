Epitrechon; or, Running Along

Parenthetic Addition by way of Statement thrown in, not complete in
itself

Ep’-i-tre-chon, from ἑτή (epi), upon, and τρέχειν (trechein), to run: to
run over or along, to overrun.

The figure is so-called because the sentence, more or less short,
is rapidly thrown in as an explanatory remark.

SUBCONTINUATIO is the name given to it by the Latins; because
sentences thus thrown in, by the way, as a kind of undercurrent,
continue one thought or statement underneath another, or follow
another immediately after.
