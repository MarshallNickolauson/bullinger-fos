Syllogismus; or, Omission of the Conclusion

Syl’-lo-gis’-mus. Greek, συλλογισμός, a reckoning altogether, a
bringing of all the premisses; and, the conclusion before the mind.
From σύν (sun), together, and λογίζεσθαι (logizesthai), to reckon.
(Hence the word “logic”).

The regular form of every argument consists of three propositions
of which the first two are called “premisses” (the first being the major,
and the latter the minor), while the last, which necessarily follows from
them, is called the “conclusion.”

But the term Syllogismus is given to this figure because it is a
departure from this rule, the law of logic being legitimately broken for
the sake of emphasis.

It falls into this division because it is a figure of Rhetoric, in which
something is omitted for the sake of emphasis. It is not the omission of
words, as such, as in Ellipsis; or of sense, as in Meiosis or Tapeinosis;
but it is a figure in which the premisses are stated, but the conclusion
is omitted, and left to the imagination to enhance and heighten the
effect; as when we say, “it can be better imagined than described.”
Indeed, so great is the emphasis which is thus acquired that the Latins
gave it other names.

They called it SIGNIFICATIO, because something is signified
which is not expressed:

RATIOCINATIO, or Reasoning, because only the Reasons (and
not the conclusion) are stated; or, special importance is given to the
reasons, even though the conclusion may be given (See Rom. 3:1-31)

And it is called EMPHASIS, because of the emphasis thus given to
the argument which is omitted.
