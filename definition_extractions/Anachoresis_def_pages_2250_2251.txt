Anachoresis; or, Regression

A Return to the Original Subject after a Digression

An-a-cho’-ree-sis. Greek, ἀναχώρησις, a going or drawing back, from
ἀνά (ana), back, and χώρησις (choreesis), a withdrawing or retiring
(from χωρέω, chore, to retire, withdraw).

This figure is a return from a digression which has been made.
Hence called by the Latins, REGRESSIO, a regression, and
RECESSIO, a receding or recession.

The Greeks had another name for it, calling it EPANACLESIS, Ep-
an-a-clee-sis, from ἐτή (epi), upon, ava (ana), back, κλῆσις (kleesis), a
calling (from καλέω (Ка/еб), to call), a calling back upon, or recalling,
in the sense of returning from a digression.
