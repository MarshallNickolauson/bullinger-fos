Horismos; or, Definition

A Definition of Terms

Hor-is’-mos. Greek, ὁρισμός (horismos), a boundary, from opiZw
(horizo), to divide, mark out, settle, define. Hence, it is called
DEFINITIO, definition.

It is the figure by which the meaning of terms is defined and fixed,
briefly and precisely: the definition of terms, so important in all kinds of
argumentation.
