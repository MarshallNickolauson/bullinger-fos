Gen. 31:21.-The Euphrates is called “the river’ on account of its

“the sea” is put for “the Great Sea,” which is another Antonomasia for
the Mediterranean. See also Mic. 7:12.
1Sa. 4:21.-“And she named the child ‘In-glorious’ (i.e., /-chabqbd),

Isa. 62:4.-

“Thou shalt no more be termed ‘Forsaken’;

Neither shall thy land any more be termed ‘Desolate’:
But thou shalt be called ‘Hephzi-bah’ (i.e., my delight is in her),
And thy land ‘Beulah’ (i.e., married).”

Here note that the four lines are alternate: the subject of the first

Jesus Christ. See Hendiadys.
Act. 22:14.-“The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
shouldest know his will, and see that Just (or Righteous) One”: i.e.,

word which would excite and inflame them. By this means he obtained
audience, until, in verse 21, he had to use the word “Gentiles” (“I will
send thee far hence unto the Gentiles”), when we read: “And they
gave him audience unto this word.”
Act. 25:26.-The Roman Emperor is called “my lord.”
