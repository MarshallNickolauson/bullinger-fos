Gen. 20:16.-Abimelech said unto Sarah concerning Abraham,
“Behold, | have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold,
he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee, and
with all other: thus she was reproved.”
“A covering of the eyes” is a periphrasis for a husband. Having
said “thy brother,” Abimelech avoids calling him directly thy husband,
and thus rebukes her by using this beautiful periphrasis. See Gen.
24:65. 1Co. 11:5, etc.

Gen. 46:26.-Those that “came out of his loins”: i.e., his direct
descendants-his children and grandchildren. Hence, the number of
these differs from (and is smaller than) the number spoken of in Act.
7:14, which embraces “all his kindred”: i.e., all his other relations who
are specifically excepted in Gen. 46:26.

Jdg. 5:10.-“Speak, ye that ride on white asses (i.e., princes), ye that
sit in judgment (i.e., rulers), and walk by the way (i.e., merchants).”

These periphrases mean simply, “Speak, ye princes, ye rulers, and
ye merchants”; but their description, instead of their names,
emphasizes the classes of persons so described.
2Sa. 3:29.-“That falleth on the sword”: i.e., is put to death by the public
executioner.
2Ch. 26:5.-Uzziah “sought God in the days of Zechariah who had
understanding in the visions of God”: /.е.. who was a Prophet.
2Ch. 32:21.-“They that came forth of his own bowels (i.e., his own
sons) slew him,” who ought to have been the very last to commit such
a crime.
Pro. 30:31.-The Periphrasis, here, in the Heb. (see marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] ) is well girt in the loins, which both the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have rendered “greyhound”!
But the figure is used of a war-horse caparisoned, mail-clad, and
adorned for war.

Ecc. 12:1-14 is full of the most beautiful examples. See under
Euphemism and Metalepsis.

Psa. 4:7.-“Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time
that their corn and their wine increased”: i.e., more than in the joy of
their abundant harvest and vintage.

Psa. 105:18 is a Periphrasis for Joseph's captivity, referring to Gen.
39:20-23; Gen. 41:12.

Psa. 132:3-4.-The Periphrasis is used in order to emphasize David’s
determination not to rest until he had done it.
Isa. 14:15.-“Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell (Sheol), to the
sides of the pit”: {6., be dead and buried.

Jer. 21:13.-“Inhabitress of the valley and rock of the plain”: i.e., Zion is
spoken of by this description on account of its situation. Compare Jos.
15:8.

Eze. 1:22.-“The likeness of the firmament upon (or over) the heads of
the living creature was as a species of ice exceedingly strong (i.e.,
crystal), etc.”

Eze. 24:16.-“The desire of thine eyes”: {6., thy wife, as is clear from
verse 18. So verses 21 and 25.

Eze. 24:25.-“The lifting up of their soul”: marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ,
their beloved sons and daughters.

Eze. 26:9.-“Engines of war”: battering-rams.

Eze. 31:14.-“The trees by the waters.” Lit., “trees drinking water.” The
Periphrasis is used for trees that are watered by irrigation. Hence,
trees planted in a garden.

Mic. 7:5.-Here we have a double Periphrasis. “The doors of thy
mouth,” by Metonymy for words, or what is said, and “her that lieth in
thy bosom” for thy wife.
Zep. 1:9.-“Those that leap on the threshold”: i.e., the servants of the
rulers and others who were sent to enter the houses of others and
take away the good things that were therein. The words that follow
show this to be the correct interpretation; for such are said to fill their
Masters’ homes with what they have taken by violence and deceit. It
does not, as many suppose, refer to idolatrous worship, for the word
ГМВ (dalag) is not so used. On the contrary: compare 2Sa. 22:30.
Psa. 18:29 (30). Son. 2:8. Isa. 35:6.

Mat. 11:11.-“Born of women’; i.e., born by natural process. See Luk.
7:28. Job. 14:1; Job. 15:14; Job. 25:4. Luk. 2:23.

Mat. 26:29.-‘This fruit of the vine” for wine. See Metonymy-

Mat. 27:62.-“The next day, that followed the day of the preparation”:
i.e., the Sabbath. This seems to be one of the most striking instances
in the New Testament, especially when we compare Luk. 23:56. The
selfsame day is meant. But mark the difference. To the holy and
devout women that day was still the Sabbath. But in the case of those
who had rejected “the Lord of the Sabbath,” what happens? It has
been observed that, when He is on the point of leaving the Temple for
the last time, our Lord, who formerly, even in that same week, before
He had been finally rejected in that House, than which He was greater,
had spoken of it as “My Father’s House,” now calls it “your house.” So,
here again. From these rejectors of the Sabbath’s Lord, the very name
of their sacred day is taken away. And the Spirit uses this long, round-
about, depreciatory phrase: “the next day, that followed the day of the
preparation.”

Luk. 2:11.-“In the city of David”: i.e., Bethlehem.

Luk. 21:35.-“All them that dwell on the face of the whole earth”: i.e.,
everyone. See under Pleonasm-

Joh. 1:9.-“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world.”

This rendering is obtained by disregarding the figure, taking the
participle “coming” as though it were the present tense, and referring it
to “every man,” instead of to “the True Light.” The common Hebrew
Periphrasis for man was иба бтемн‚ the comer into the world*
[Note: In accordance with Luk. 2:23.] But this expression (the Coming
One) in the New Testament (and especially in John’s writings) is used
exclusively of Christ alone, and this in an exalted sense as the
Coming One. Thus the verse reads, “The True Light is he who, coming
into the world, lighteneth every man’ ({6., of course, every man
without distinction, not without exception! which would not be true).
Thus the verse teaches: (1) that no longer was the Light to be
confined to one nation or to one People, but was to enlighten all
without distinction of race; and (2) that no man can be enlightened
except by Christ.
2Co. 5:1.-“Our earthly house of this tabernacle”: i.e., this body.
1Th. 4:1-18 -In this chapter there are three examples of Periphrasis,
all used for the Gentiles:

Verse 5, “which know not God.”
Verse 12, “them that are without.”
Verse 13, “others which have no hope.”

The description, by which the Gentiles are thus spoken of, is so
much more expressive than the mere mention of the word “Gentiles.”
Heb. 1:14.-“Heirs of salvation” is a beautiful Periphrasis for the elect.
2Pe. 1:13.-“As long as | am in this tabernacle”: {6., am alive.

Verse 14, “Shortly | must put off this my tabernacle”: i.e., must die.
This is strictly speaking Euphemy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ): viz., a
pleasant periphrasis to describe an unpleasant fact, instead of naming
it plainly.
