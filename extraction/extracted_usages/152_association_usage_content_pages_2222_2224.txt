Act. 17:27.-“That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.”

Eph. 2:1-3.-“And you hath he quickened, who were dead in
trespasses and sins; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the
prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
children of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our
conversation in times past,” etc.

Tit. 3:1-3.-After speaking of the exhortations to be given to others, the
apostle includes himself when he comes to speak of the state and
condition of every sinner by nature. “For we ourselves also were
sometimes foolish,” etc.

Heb. 3:6.-“But Christ as a son over his own house: whose house are
we.”

Heb. 10:25.-“Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as
the manner of some is.”

Sometimes this turning to include others is only apparent. That is
to say, there may be a change from the immediate context, but not
from the real continuation as shown by the structure.

See Heb. 1:1-14 and ii:-

А 1:1, 2-. God speaking to “us.”

В -2-14. The Son (God) “better than the angels” (“them”).
А 2:1-4. God speaking to “us.”
В 5-18. The Son (man) “lower than the angels” (“them”).

Here 2:1 is the real continuation of 1:2-, and not of 1:14; while 2:5
is the real continuation of 1:14, and not of 2:4.

So that the change of persons here is only apparent, and does not
arise from the Figure Association.
