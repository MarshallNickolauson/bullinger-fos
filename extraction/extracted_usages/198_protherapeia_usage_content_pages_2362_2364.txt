Joh. 3:2.-“Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God,”
etc.

Mat. 19:16.-“And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master.”
See under Synocoeosis. So Mar. 10:17. Luk. 18:18.

Act. 17:22.-“Ye men of Athens, | perceive that in all things ye are very
religious.” This is the meaning of the word (see R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] margin) δεισιδαιµονέστερος
(deisidaimonesteros), careful in the discharge of religious services.
For religion in itself is nothing. It depends entirely on what the religion
is, whether true or false.

There are only two religions in the world; and there never have
been more from Gen. 4:1-26 to the present day. They are put in the
forefront of Revelation. Abel's and Cain’s; God’s way and man’s way;
God’s way, and man’s attempted improvement on it.

All kinds of false religion agree in one thing. They are all alike, and
all at one in demanding that the sinner must do something, be
something, give, pay, feel, experience, or produce something, to merit
God’s favour. They quarrel bitterly as to what that something is to be.
Controversies rage concerning it; the blood of martyrs has been shed;
battles have been fought; but yet they are all agreed that the sinner
must say, “Something in my hand | bring.”
Whereas the one and only true religion is expressed in the words,
“NOTHING in my hand | bring.”
So that a man may be “very religious,” and yet be unsaved, and
“far off’ from God (Eph. 2:13).
Act. 26:2-3 is another beautiful example of true Protherapeia. See
also 22:3-6, etc.
