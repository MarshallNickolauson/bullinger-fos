Gen. 2:24.-“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
and shall cleave unto his wife.” This does not mean that he is to
forsake and no longer to love or care for his parents. So Mat. 19:5.
Gen. 41:47.-“And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth
by handfuls”: i.e., one grain produced a handful of grains, which is
hyperbolical of a prolific increase.

So verse 49.
Gen. 42:28.-“Their heart failed them.” Here the Hyperbole “their heart
went out,” is thus beautifully rendered.
Exo. 8:17.-“All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land
of Egypt”: i.e., wherever in all the land there was dust, it became lice.
Deu. 1:28.-‘The cities are great, and walled up to heaven,” to express
their great height. So Deu. 9:1, etc.
Jdg. 5:4-5, beautifully sets forth the Divine Majesty manifested in
Jehovah's leading the People into the Promised Land.
Jdg. 20:16.-“Every one could sling stones at an hair and not miss”: to
describe the wonderful proficiency which the Benjamites had attained
in slinging stones. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has added breadth in italics, so as to
lessen the boldness of the Hyperbole, “an hair breadth.”
1Sa. 5:12.-“The cry of the city went up to heaven,” to describe the
greatness of the cry.

1Sa. 7:6.-“And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
poured it out before the Lord, and fasted, etc.” This is an hyperbolical
description of the intensity of their weeping and lamentation. Similar
descriptions occur Psa. 6:6; Psa. 119:136. Jer. 9:1. Lam. 3:48-49.
1Sa. 25:37.-Nabal’s “heart died within him, and he became as a
stone”: i.e., he was terribly frightened and collapsed or fainted away.
1Ki. 1:40.-“So that the earth rent with the sound of them.” A
hyperbolical description of their jumping and leaping for joy.
1Ki. 10:5.-“There was no more spirit in her”: i.e., she was dazed or
stupefied, as we say, with astonishment.
2Ch. 28:9.-“A rage that reacheth up unto heaven,” to express the
intensity of the rage.
Ezr. 9:6.-“Our trespass is grown up unto the heavens,” to express the
enormity of their sin.
Neh. 8:4.-“And Ezra the Scribe stood upon a tower (marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] ) of wood”: i.e., a high wooden structure; or, as we should
say, a platform or pulpit.
Job. 29:6.-“The rock poured me out rivers of oil”: i.e., | had
abundance of all good things. So chap. 20:17 and Mic. 6:7.
Job. 39:19.-“Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?”

Glassius gives this as an Hyperbole for the neighing of the horse,
but it seems better to take ШТОД (ra’mah), of a flowing mane, from
ШТН (ra’am), to tremble, shake, wave, as in verse 25.

The word denotes a shaking, as well as the noise caused by the
shaking. See Psa. 104:7. Isa. 29:6. The Ixx. has φόβον (phobon), fear,
perhaps a mistake for φόβην (phobeen), a mane:-“Thou hast clothed
his neck with a flowing mane.”

Psa. 107:26.-“They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to
the depths”: to express the violence of a storm; and waves, as we Say,
“mountain-high.”

Pro. 23:8.-“The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up”: to
express the suffering of regrets at having received benefits from such
a host.

Isa. 5:25; Isa. 42:15.-These are hyperbolical descriptions to set forth
the excessive anger and judgments of Jehovah in making the Land
desolate.

Isa. 14:13.-‘I will ascend into heaven”: to express the pride of Lucifer.
Isa. 57:9.-“Thou ... didst debase thyself even unto hell (Sheol)”; to
emphasize the indignity of Ahaz, king of Judah in sending to Tiglath-
Pileser, king of Assyria, to help him against Israel, saying, “I am thy
servant!” (2Ki. 16:7, etc.).

Jer. 1:19; Jer. 15:20.-“They shall fight against thee” (see below, Jam.
4:1).

The verb, which means to wage war, is Hyperbole when used of a
single individual; but it told Jeremiah how bitter the opposition of man
would be to his Divine message.

Jer. 4:29.-“The whole city shall flee ... they shall go into thickets.” Lit.,
into the clouds; to express the inaccessible places.

Jer. 51:9.-“Her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even
to the skies”: to express the magnitude of Babylon’s sin which called
for such a judgment (Rev. 18:5).

Jer. 51:53.-“Though Babylon should mount up to heaven”; to express
the pride of Babylon.

Lam. 2:1.-“How hath the Lord ... cast down from heaven unto the
earth the beauty of Israel”: to express the degradation of Zion and the
height of glory from which she had fallen.

Lam. 2:11.-“My liver is poured upon the earth, etc”: to express the
depth of the Prophet's grief and sorrow at the desolations of Zion.
Eze. 27:28.-“The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy
pilots.”

So R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , but both margins say
waves. The root ВШЩЦ (garash) means to drive out, drive about.
When used of a city, it refers to the suburbs which are driven out from
the city: but, used of the sea, it means the driving and casting about of
its waves. See Isa. 57:20.

The figure here expresses the greatness of the terror of the
defenders of Tyre in the day of its overthrow: “the waves of the sea
shall lash themselves at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.”
Dan. 9:21.-“Gabriel ... being caused to fly swiftly.” Lit. (see marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] ), with weariness: i.e., with such swiftness as to
cause weariness.

Mat. 11:23.-“And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven,
shall be brought down to hell.” Or, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , “And thou Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto
heaven? thou shalt go down (or be brought down) unto Hades.”

Mat. 21:13.-“My house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have
made it a den of thieves.” The Lord thus emphasizes the fact which is
plainly stated in Mal. 3:8 : “Ye have robbed me.”

Luk. 14:26.-“If any man come to me and hate not his father and
mother”: i.e., does not esteem them less than me. So the verb to hate
is used (Gen. 29:31. Rom. 9:13).

“Anger’ is used for displeasure (Deu. 3:26).

“Save” is used for preserve (Job. 2:6. Eze. 18:17).

“Lose the life” is used of esteeming it as a small matter (Mat.
10:39; Mat. 16:25. Mar. 8:35. Luk. 9:24; Luk. 17:33, as is clear from
Rev. 12:11).

To mar is used for hurting (Rth. 4:6): i.e., for his heirs.

To rob is used of receiving wages (2Co. 11:8).* [Note: As we often
say, in declining a favour, “I have no wish to rob you.”]
Luk. 18:5.-“Lest by her continual coming she weary me.” True of man-
but an Hyperbole as applied to God.

See Anthropopatheia
Joh. 3:26.-“All men come to him.” Thus his disciples said to John, to
show their sense of the many people who followed the Lord.

Joh. 12:19.-“Behold, the world is gone after him.” The enemies of the
Lord thus expressed their indignation at the vast multitudes which
followed Him.

Jam. 3:6.-“The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.” It is a question
here, whethor κόσμος (Kosmos) does not mean ornament or adorning,
as in 1Pe. 3:3 : i.e., the decking or adorning of iniquity, glozing it over
and making that which is sinful, appear to be innocent, etc.

Jam. 4:1.-“From whence come wars and fightings among you.” The
word “war” is used hyperbolically when applied to the quarrels of
social life. So Jer. 1:19; Jer. 15:20 (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ). See
above.

Other examples of Hyperbole may be seen in 2Sa. 17:13. 2Ki.
19:24. Job. 40:18. Isa. 14:14; Isa. 34:3-4; Isa. 34:7. Eze. 26:4; Eze.
32:5-8. Amo. 9:13. Nah. 2:3. Gal. 4:15.

Examples pertaining to

comparisons
are frequent, where one thing is compared with another, when there is
nothing common between them:-

The sand of the sea and the dust of the earth are constantly used
to express a vast number. (See under /diom).

Gen. 13:16; Gen. 22:17; Gen. 28:14. 1Ki. 4:20. 2Ch. 1:9. Heb.
11:12 : of Abraham's seed.

Jdg. 7:12 : of the Midianites.

1Sa. 13:5 : of the Philistines.

1Ki. 4:29 : of Solomon’s largeness of heart.

Job. 29:18 : of the days of a man’s life.

Psa. 78:27 : of the feathered fowl in the wilderness.

Isa. 29:5 : of other peoples.

Jer. 15:8 : of Judah’s widows.

Other comparisons may be seen.
2Sa. 1:23.-Saul and Jonathan “swifter than eagles,” “stronger than
lions.”

So Jer. 4:13, and Lam. 4:19, to express great velocity.
1Ki. 10:27.-Silver and gold as stones. So 2Ch. 1:15; 2Ch. 9:20.
Job. 6:3.-Job’s grief heavier than the sand.
Job. 41:18.-Leviathan’s sneezings causing light to shine.
Hab. 2:5.-To express great rapacity.
Lam. 4:7-8.-To express and contrast the dignity and indignity of the
sons of Zion.
hypotheses.

Sometimes we have Hyperbolical Hypotheses, which are
impossible in themselves, but are used to express the greatness of
the subject spoken of.

Psa. 139:8; Psa. 139:10.-To show the wondrous omnipresence of
God.
Pro. 27:22.-To show the folly and incorrigibility of the fool.
Oba. 1:4.-To emphasize the certainty of the coming judgment of
Edom. Compare Jer. 49:16, and Mat. 11:23 as quoted above.

Mar. 8:36. Luk. 9:25.-To express the utmost gain and make the
strongest contrast.

1Co. 4:15.-To express the difference between pedagogues and
parents.

1Co. 13:1-3.-There are many hyperbolical hypotheses in these
verses, to show the all-importance of the love of God shed abroad in
the heart by the Holy Ghost.

Gal. 1:8.-An angel from heaven preaching a different gospel is
inconceivable. The hypothesis is used in order to show the importance
of the Gospel of God.

1Ki. 20:10.-“The boasting of Benhadad.”

Mat. 5:29.-“If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out ...”

Mat. 5:30.-“If thy right hand offend thee, etc.”

It is perfectly clear that Christ does not wish us to mutilate our
bodies: so that this must be an hyperbolical or emphatic exhortation to
avoid and remove everything and anything that causes us to stumble.
Luk. 10:4 is an hyperbolical command not to loiter or delay in
ceremonious salutations (such as are common even to the present
day).

Joh. 21:25 is also Hyperbole. The verb χωρῆσαι (ch?reesai) is to be
taken in the same sense, as it is in Mat. 19:11, where the Lord says,
“All men cannot receive this saying;” and in verse 12, “He that is able
to receive it, let him receive it.” The “world” is also put by Metonymy
for mankind.

Hence, Thophylact expounds χωρῆσαι (ch?reesai), to receive, by
νοῆσαι (ποεεςεῆ, to understand.

Rom. 9:3.-“For | could wish that myself were accursed from Christ” is
an hyperbolical supposition.

Or we may take this sentence as being in a parenthesis, and
render the imperfect tense ηὐχόμην (eeuchomeen) in the sense of /
used to wish.

The passage would then read, “I have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart for my brethren, my kinsmen according to
the flesh, (for | used to wish myself to be a cursed thing from Christ).”

Jud. 1:23.-“Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.” This is
an hyperbolical prohibition as to avoiding all contact with defilement.

In the statements of the Lord Jesus there often seems to be an
Hyperbole when there is really none: e.g., Mar. 16:15. Joh. 3:32.
Anabasis; or, Gradual Ascent

An Increase of Sense in successive Sentences
A-n?b’-a-sis. Greek, ἀνάβασις, from ava (ana), up, and βαΐνειν
(bainein), to go; βάσις (basis) means a stepping, or a step. So that
Anabasis means a going up* [Note: Hence, the journey or expedition
of Cyrus up from the coast into Central Asia is called his Anabasis, by
Xenophon.] or ascent. The Figure is so called when a writing, speech,
or discourse, ascends up step by step, each with an increase of
emphasis or sense.

This figure was called by the Latins INCREMENTUM (/n?-cr?-
men?-tum), growth or increase, from incresco, to grow on or upon.
Hence our words “increase” and “increment.”

When this increase or ascent is from weaker to stronger
expression, and is confined to words, it is called Climax (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]).

[N.B.-When the sense or gradation is downward instead of
