Psa. 1:3.-“He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.” Here,
the similitude tells us that the man who meditates in God’s word is
planted and protected, just as a tree in a garden is cared for as a “tree
of the field” is not.

See under Ellipsis, page 97.

Psa. 1:4.-“The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the
wind driveth away.” The contrast between the driven chaff and the
“planted” tree is most striking and solemn.

The two comparisons are the great features of the Psalm, the
structure of which is as follows:-

A а — 1. The godly blessed in not standing among the ungodly.

Ь 2, 3-. Comparison (2? 22). “Like a tree.”
ο -3. Prosperity.
A ο — 4-. The Contrary: “not so.”
Ь — -4. Comparison (22 22). “Like the chaff.”
а 5. The ungodly punished in not standing among the godly.

Then the last verse stands out alone in solemn grandeur as giving
the reason for the whole.
Psa. 5:12 (13).-“With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.”
And why is His “favour” (i.e., His grace, which is favour to the
unworthy) like a shield? Because “in his favour is life,” Psa. 30:5 (6);
because in His favour there is mercy (Isa. 60:10); because in His
favour there is preservation (Psa. 86:2, margin); because in His favour
there is security, Psa. 41:11 (12): and therefore the prayer of all such
favoured ones will ever be Psa. 106:4.
Psa. 17:8.-“Keep me as the apple of the eye [is kepf].”

Psa. 131:2.-"| have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.”

Mat. 7:24-27.-Here we have a magnificent and extended Simile,
almost amounting to a parable. It is too long to quote, and too plain to
need elucidation. It explains to us very clearly and forcibly its own
powerful lesson.

Mat. 9:36.-“They ... were scattered abroad as sheep having no
shepherd.

1Pe. 2:25.-“Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.”

Here we have Simile, which stands in marked contrast to the
Proverb in 2Pe. 2:22, as to the “sow.” Both the stray sheep and the
washed sow “return.” But the one returns to the shepherd, and the
other to the mire. We may note also that the verb “returned” as used
of the “sheep” is the passive form; while, as used of the “sow,” it is the
active form. Showing that the “sheep” is made to return by a
constraining power, while the “sow” returns of its own act and free-will.
See under Paroemia.
Sometimes a Simile is really used as a figure, implying not
merely a resemblance but the actual thing itself.

Gen. 25:31.-“Sell me as on this day (2222, kayy6m)’: i.e., on this
very day. See, too, verse 33.
Num. 11:1.-The Heb. reads: “And when the People was as
murmurers, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah.”

Here the resemblance was real: i.e., they were murmurers.
Neh. 7:2.-“I gave my brother Hanani ... charge over Jerusalem: for he
acted as a faithful man (2222), etc.”: {Θ., he was a faithful man.
Isa. 1:7.-“It is desolate as the overthrow of strangers.” See A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin.

See under Antimereia, and compare Isa. 13:6.
Isa. 1:9.-“Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small
remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
like unto Gomorrah.”

Here the words of the godly remnant declare the resemblance;
and in the next verse Jehovah endorses it as true; addressing the
ungodly but most religious nation actually as “the rulers of Sodom”
and “the people of Gomorrah.”

Psa. 122:3.-“Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together’:
ie., it was a city so built.

Hos. 5:10.-“The princes of Judah were like them that remove the
bound”: i.e., they actually committed this sin, the greatness of which is
seen from Deu. 19:14; Deu. 27:17.

Mat. 14:5.-“Because they counted him as a prophet”: i.e., as actually
a prophet.

Luk. 22:44.-“His sweat was as it were great drops of blood”: i.e., it
was.

Joh. 1:14.-“And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten
of the Father”: i.e., the glory of Him who was really the only begotten
Son of the Father.

Rom. 9:32.-“Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it
were (i.e., actually) by the works of the law.”

2Co. 2:17.-“We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but
as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ”:
i.eé., we speak really and truly sincere, pure, and Divine words.
2Co. 3:18.-“We are all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror
(κατοτπριζόµενοι, katoptrizomenoi) the glory of the Lord, are trans-
figured to the same image, from glory to glory, even as from the Lord-
the Spirit’: ie., really by the actual operation of the Holy Spirit. His
office is to glorify Christ; and those who are led by the Spirit do occupy
themselves with Christ-the heavenly object, and thus become like
Him, heavenly, and that without an effort. Indeed, the measure in
which we are “filled with the Spirit” is the measure in which we are
thus occupied with Christ.

Sometimes the word “as” is followed by the word “so,” to
strengthen and heighten the comparison, and make it more clear:
asin
Isa. 24:2.-“And it shall be
As with the people,

So with the priest;
As with the servant,
So with his master;
As with the maid,
So with her mistress;
As with the buyer,
So with the seller;
As with the lender,
So with the borrower;
As with the taker of usury,
So with the giver of usury to him.”
And all this to show the universality of the judgment which shall
make the land empty and desolate.
This is a combination of Syncrisis with this form of Simile.
Isa. 55:10, 11.-
а “As the rain cometh down, and the snow
Ь — Ргот heaven,
с And returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and
maketh it bring forth and bud,
@Я — That it may give seed to the sower, and bread to
the eater.

а — So shall my word be that goeth forth

Ь Out of my mouth:
ο Itshall not return unto me void,
а Βιΐ it shall accomplish that which | please, and it
shall prosper in the thing whereto | sent it.”

Here, in this beautiful comparison, we have in a and a the two
things compared, the Word resembling the rain and snow; in b and b
we have their source; in c and c, their destiny, not returning void; and
in d and d, their end prospering, end the accomplishment of their
mission.

“AS” and “SO.”

We have collected a number of these examples of the use of “as”
and “so” together; and arranged them, not in the sequence of the
books of the Bible, or in full; but we have numbered them and placed
them so as to illustrate the ways of God in grace:-

1. Sin and death (Rom. 5:12). These words explain the mystery
of the first and last Adam, and the first and second man: their
temptation and its results as shown in Gen. 3:1-24, Mat.
4:1-25, and Rom. 6:23. This explains

2. Offence and righteousness: judgment and free gift (Rom.
5:18); also

3. Disobedience and obedience: sinners and righteous (Rom.
5:19). Hence the eternal results of

4. Sin and death: grace and eternal life (Rom. 5:21).

Now we pass from sin and its entrance and consequences to

5. — № remedy. The Serpent and the Son of Man (Joh. 3:14). Note
the two “musts” (verses 7 and 14); and the parabolic miracle of
Num. 21:5-9. Note the ‘lifting up” spoken of in Joh. 12:32. The
“all” means all without distinction (no longer the one People of
Israel) not “all” without exception.

In due time Christ came to be thus “lifted up,” and

6. do the Father’s will, and Commandment, and He did (Joh.
14:31), and

7. suffered; Lamb dumb, and so He; etc. (Isa. 53:7). Hence
8. Once to die, and once offered (Heb. 9:27-28).

Then

9. they are sent, “Sent Me” and “sent them” (Joh. 17:18)

10. to bear testimony of His grace: “Believed” and “done” (Mat.
8:13),

11. yea, of His life-giving grace: Life (Joh. 5:26).

12. God reveals Himself. Heaven and earth; ways and thoughts
(Isa. 55:9), and

13. man, morally: Foolish as a beast (Psa. 73:22).

14. Fathers and sons, etc., ye (Act. 7:51); and
15. physically, the Flower that flourisheth (Psa. 103:15).

Then He reveals

16. His mercy: Heaven high and mercy great (Psa. 103:11),

17. His forgiveness: East from west and trangressions removed
(Psa. 103:12),

18. His pity: A father and the Lord (Psa. 103:13), and

19. His love: The Father and | (Joh. 15:9).

Then He reveals

20. our relationships and duties: Many members and one body
(Rom. 12:4; see 1Co. 12:12-13).

21. Mutual forgiveness: Christ forgave and do ye (Col. 3:13),

22. Christ-like walk: Received and walk ye (Col. 2:6).

23. Divine consolations: Sufferings and consolation (2Co. 1:5;
2Co. 1:7).

24. Missionary work: Received and minister (1Ре. 4:10); with
25. the Divine promise, Rain and snow: the word of God (Isa.
55:10-11); and

26. the Divine support, Thy days and thy strength (Deu. 33:25).

Oh may our desire to do His will be according to,

27. The hart panting, and the soul longing (Psa. 42:1 (2)).

The JEW.

28. All blessing based on God's original covenant-promise; Stars
and seed (Jer. 33:22), see especially Gen. 15:5, and Rom.
4:18. The covenant of works they brake, see Exo. 24:3; Exo.
24:7 and Jer. 31:32, and are now suffering the consequences.

29. The future blessing of Israel will be under the original
covenant, of grace: as Mother comforteth, so will | comfort (Isa.
66:13).

30. Bridegroom and thy God (Isa. 62:5).

31. The waters of Noah, and wrath (Isa. 54:9-10).

32. Shepherd seeking and | will seek (Eze. 34:12).
The GENTILE. We must not separate what God has joined
together, nor join together what God has separated (Mat. 19:6). The
Jew, the Gentile, and the Church of God, are distinct in their calling,
standing, hope, and destiny (1Co. 10:32). The preaching of the
Gospel is not to convert the world, but to take out a People (Act.
15:14); while the world will get worse and worse until Christ suddenly
comes.

33. Lightning, and coming (Mat. 24:27).

34. The days of Noah, and the coming of the Son of Man (Mat.

24:37-39).

The CHURCH OF GOD. Christ's advent will wear a different
aspect to the Church. Not like the lightning or a thief, but

35. “this same Jesus.” As ye have seen Him go will so come (Act.

1:11). Christ’s resurrection is the type and pledge of ours.
36. As all in Adam die, so all in Christ made alive (1Co. 15:22).
Note the “order” (verses 23 and 24).
