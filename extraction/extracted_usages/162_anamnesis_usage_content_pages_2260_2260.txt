Rom. 9:3 is an interesting example; which has been already referred
to under Epitrechon and Hyperbole (q.v. [NNote: Which see.] ).

We should note that the verb is in the imperfect tense ηὐχόμην
(eeuchomeen), and has the sense of / used to wish. And it may refer
to his former condition as a Jew, and to his old hatred of the very
name of Christ.

It occurs as the opening of the Dispensational part of the Epistle to
the Romans. See under Correspondence.
