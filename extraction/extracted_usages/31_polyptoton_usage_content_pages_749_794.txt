I. Verbs
1. Verbs repeated in different moods and tenses
Gen. 1:24.-Here, the Hebrew is: “God, when He visiteth, or in
visiting, will visit you.”

And this, in order to emphasize the certainty of Joseph’s belief in
the promise of God, as is stated in Heb. 11:22. “By faith Joseph, when
he died made mention of (margin, remembered) the departing of the
children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones:” {6.,
Joseph remembered the promise of God made to his fathers and had
such faith in it that he expressed his certainty s to its fulfillment by the
use of this figure.

It is translated: “God will surely visit you”: but to give effect to the
figure we might render it: “God will most certainly visit you,” putting
great emphasis on the words “most certainly.”

Exo. 23:5.-‘If thou wouldest forbear to help him, helping thou shalt
help with him”: {Θ., as A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “thou shalt surely help with him”
(See Appendix D, Homonyms).

2Ki. 21:13.-“And | will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish,
wiping it and turning it upside down.”

The figure is thus used to emphasise the completeness with which
the Lord would empty Jerusalem.

Jer. 8:4.-
“Shall they fall and not arise?
Shall he turn away and not return?”
As these words stand they are unintelligible and the figure is
obscured. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is no
improvement:-

“Shall men fall, and not rise up again?

Shall one turn away and not return?”

The Massorah* [Note: Ginsburg’s Edition, Vol. ΙΙ, page 54.] calls
attention to the fact that of the two words “turn and,” the first letter of
the second word should be the last letter of the first word, this being
one of the examples where words are wrongly divided.

Thus read the sense comes out in agreement with the context of
which Israel is the subject:-

“Shall they fall and not arise?
Shall they return [fo Him] and He not return [fo them].

This agrees also with Mal. 3:7, and it brings out the
correspondence between the two lines, as well as exhibits more
clearly the Polyptoton.

Mat. 11:15.-“He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” ὦτα ἀκούειν,
ἀκουέτω (gota akouein akouetq).

On fourteen occasions in the New Testament does the Lord use
this expression (thus, or in similar words), and we place them all
together here under the first occurrence so that we may see the
fulness of the cumulative effect.

In the English we have a Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]) as
well, “ears {ο hear,” but not in the Greek, except in the case of the
eight in Revelations, where we have οὓς ακουσάτω (ous akousato).
The real figure lies in the emphatic polyptoton in each case.

This solemn injunction was never used by mere human lips. No
mortal man could demand the attention to which this emphatic
command lays claim None but the Lord ever used these words. They
are (unlike many other of the examples) translated literally, but they
mean: He whose ears are opened, let him surely hear, or let him take
heed to give the most earnest attention!

This attention and obedience the Lord claimed on fourteen
separate occasions.

The fourteen are not divided into two sevens, but into six and eight
(two fours and two threes).
Six being the number of man, He spoke the words six times as
“the Son of Man” on earth: and eight being the number of
resurrection), He spoke the words eight times as the Risen Lord from
heaven.

Though the occasions were fourteen (7 X 2) on which the words
were used, the actual number of times the words are written down by
the Holy Spirit is sixteen (4 X 4, or 42), two being in the parallel
passages in the Gospels.* [Note: For the significance of these
numbers see Number in Scripture (pp 20-47). by the same author and
publisher.]

These fourteen occasions are connected with different parts of one
great subject, which is dispensational in its character: and this figure
being used only of this one subject, points us to the significant fac that
it requires the Divinely opened ear to understand the great
dispensational change which was about to take place.

It had been foretold in Isa. 6:9 (see above) that it should come
about in consequence of the ears being closed to the divine
announcement: and seven times this solemn infliction of judicial
blindness is written down in the Scriptures of Truth.

When the great change was announced in consequence and
fulfillment of this! then, fourteen times did the Lord Himself emphasize
the important fact that only the opened ear would be able to
understand it; implying that it referred to secret things, and that only
those to whom that secret was revealed would be able to understand
it or receive it.
For the interpretation of these fourteen occurrences, see Things to
Come (July to Dec., 1896; Jan. and Feb., 1897; Sept. and Oct., 1898,
etc.)* [Note: G. Stoneman, 39 Warwick Lane, London, E.C.] We here
give merely their order.

1. Elijah and John the Baptist (Mat. 11:15).

2. The parable of the sower (Mat. 13:9; Mar. 4:9; Luk. 8:8).

3. The candlestick (Mar. 4:21-23).

4. The parable of the tares (Mat. 13:43).

5. The two dispensations (Mar. 7:16).

6. The tower; the king and the salt: or, the great supper and its

lessons (Luk. 14:16-35).
7-13. The epistles to the seven churches (Rev. 2:1-29, iii.).
14. The beast from the sea (Rev. 13:9).
Mat. 13:9; Mat. 13:43.-See 11:15.
Mat. 19:12.-“He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” (xwpsiv
χωρείω, chaprein спфгейф).
Mar. 4:12.-See Mat. 13:13.

Mar. 4:23.-See Mat. 11:15.

Mar. 7:16.-See Mat. 11:15.

Luk. 8:8.-See Mat. 13:13.

Luk. 14:35.-See Mat. 11:15.

Joh. 12:40.-See Mat. 13:13.

Joh. 13:7.-Here there is apparently a Polyptoton of the verb “to know,”
but it is only in the English, not in the Greek. “What | do thou knowest
not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.”

In the Greek the two verbs are different. The first is οὐκ οἶδας (ouk
oidas), thou knowest not as a matter of fact. The second is γνώσῃ
(σπφςεε) thou shalt learn, i.e., get to know hereafter.” It is this latter
verb which is used in 1Co. 2:14, for the natural man not only cannot
receive, or discern, them, but he cannot even /earn them, or get to
know them, not having the necessary spiritual capacity.

Joh. 13:10.-Here again there is no Polyptoton of the verb to wash, as
appears in the English, for in the Greek the two words are quite
different. “He that is washed (λελουµένος, leloumenos, i.e., bathed)
needeth not save to wash (viwao8al, nipsasthai, i.e., to wash a part of
the body) his feet.” The teaching is that he who is purged by the
offering on the brazen altar, needeth only the water of the brazen
laver, which was for “the priests to wash in.” So those who are
regenerated by the Holy Ghost and have their standing in Christ need
only the washing of the hands and the feet, {6., the cleansing of their
works and ways by “the washing of water by the word.”

Joh. 17:26.-“And | have declared unto them thy name and will
declare it.”

Joh. 17:25.-“O righteous Father, the world hath not known (éyvw,
едпф) thee: but | have known (ἔγνων, egnapn) thee, and these have
known (ἔγνωσαν, egnosan) that thou hast sent me.”

Rom. 2:21-23.-“Thou therefore that teachest (6 διδάσκων ho
didaskqpn) another, teachest (διδάσκεις, didaskeis) thou not thyself?

Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal (uu
κλέππειν, KAETITEIC, Mee ΚΙερίείη, klepteis)?

Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
commit adultery (μὴ µοιχεύειν, µοικεύεις, Mee moicheuein,
moicheueis)?

Thou that makest thy boast of the law (νόµωῳ, потф) through
breaking the law (νόµου, nomou), dishonourest thou God?”
1Co. 6:2.-“Do ye not know that the saints shall judge (κρινοῦσιν,
krinousin) the world? and if the world shall be judged (κρίνεται,
krinetai) by you, are ye unworthy [fo judge] (Ellipsis of the verb) the
smallest matters (κριτηρίων, kriteeriqn), i.e., “are you unworthy [fo
judge] the smallest judgments?”

2Co. 1:10.-“Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth
deliver: in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us.”
Gal. 1:8-9.-“But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any
other gospel (sUayyeAiZntal, euangelizeetai) unto you than that which
we have preached (εὐηγγελισάμεθα, eueengelisametha) unto you, let
him be accursed. As we said before, so say | now again, If any man
preach any other gospel (εὐαγγελίζεται, euangelizetai) unto you ...
let him be accursed.”

See also under Anaphora.
2Ti. 3:13.-“But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
deceiving and being deceived.”
2Ti. 4:17-18.-“And | was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. And
the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work.”

There is also the figure of Polysyndeton in this verse (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]).
1Jn. 3:7.-“Little children, let no man deceive you; he that doeth
righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.”

See also this verse under the figure of Tapeinosis.
Heb. 10:37.-“He who cometh will come”: {6., He will surely come.

See also under the figure of Epizeuxis.
Rev. 2:7; Rev. 2:11; Rev. 2:17; Rev. 2:29; Rev. 3:6; Rev. 3:13; Rev.
3:22; Rev. 13:9.-See Mat. 11:15, and, under Correspondence, “The
seven epistles to the churches” by the Holy Spirit through St. Paul.
2. Verbs with their Infinitives or Participles
In this case a verb and its participle are used in combination in order
to add an intensity to the sense; or to give the verb, as it were, a
superlative degree.
This form of the figure is sometimes called Ho-mog’-e-nee (from
ὁμός (homos), the same, and γένος, genos, kindred).
HOMOGENE means therefore of the same kindred, akin, because
the two verbs are akin.
It is used in two ways:-
a. In strong and emphatic affirmation.
a. In strong negation.
(a) In strong affirmation or exhortation
Gen. 2:16.-“Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.”
Hebrew, eating thou shalt eat.
The conjugated verb is strengthened and emphasized by the
infinitive preceding it. This infinitive Eve omitted in 3:2, and thus
“diminished” from the word of God.

Gen. 2:17.-“Thou shalt surely die.” Hebrew, dying thou shalt die.

Here again Eve (3:3) alters the Word of God by saying “Lest ye
die”!* [Note: Not only does she thus diminish from and alter the Word
of God but she adds to it the words “neither shall ye touch it,” which
the Lord God had not spoken!] Τι ОЙН (moth tahmuth) thou shalt
most certainly die, were the words of the Lord God.

Thus she changes a certainty into a contingency.

See this verse under the figure of Synecdoche.

Gen. 3:16.-“Unto the woman He said multiplying, | will multiply thy
sorrow, etc.,” i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “ will greatly multiply.”

Gen. 28:22.-Hebrew, “Tithing, will | tithe for thee,” i.e., as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “I
will surely give the tenth unto thee.”

Gen. 37:33.-“Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.”
The Heb. is δΐό δῖό (taroph, toraph), tearing, he is torn. The
figure employed shows the intensity of Jacob’s feelings. He exclaims:
“The tunic of my son!
А йа beast hath devoured him!
Tearing-Joseph is torn.”
Le., he hath been certainly killed or cruelly mangled.
Exo. 3:16.-“l have surely visited you.” Hebrew, visiting | have visited
you.
Exo. 19:12.-Here the figure is translated: “He ... shall be surely put to
death.” Lit., stoning, he shall be stoned.
So verse 13: “He shall surely be stoned.”
Jos. 24:10.-“But | would not hearken unto Balaam: therefore he
blessed you still.” Hebrew, blessing, he blessed you: i.e., he kept
blessing you, or he surely blessed you, or he did nothing but bless
you, or he blessed you exceedingly.

2Ki. 3:23.-“The kings are surely slain.” Hebrew, destroying they are
destroyed.

Psa. 118:18.-“The Lord hath chastened me sore.” Hebrew, Jah
chastening hast chastened me.

Isa. 6:9.-“Hear ye indeed.” Hebrew, Hear ye in hearing. “And see ye
indeed.” Hebrew, “See ye in seeing,” etc.

On four occasions is this great dispensational prophecy repeated
in the New Testament in order to emphasise and call attention to the
great change which was about to take place.

1. Mat. 13:14. Mar. 4:12. Luk. 8:4.

2. Joh. 12:39-40.

3. Act. 28:25-27,

4. Rom. 11:8.
Thus, seven times in all, this great prophecy is written down by the
Holy Spirit in the Scriptures of Truth.

See Mat. 11:15 above (page 269).
Jer. 22:10.-“Weep sore for him that goeth away.” Hebrew, weeping
weep.
Jer. 23:17.-“They say still unto them that despise me,” etc. Hebrew,
saying they say: i.e., they maintain, or they keep saying, etc.
Dan. 11:13.-“He shall certainly come.” Hebrew, coming he shall
come.
Zec. 8:21.-“Let us go speedily.” Hebrew, going let us go.
Mat. 13:13.-“Because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear
not”: i.e., they are determined not to hear and not to see.

See also Mar. 4:12. Luk. 8:10. Joh. 12:40. Act. 28:26; and Rom.
11:8 : where Isa. 6:9 is quoted.
Act. 7:34.-Here the figure of Polyptoton is translated as though it were
Epizeuxis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). Lit. it is “Seeing | have seen”:
i.e., | have surely seen.
Act. 28:26-27.-See Mat. 13:13.
Rom. 11:8.-See Mat. 13:13.
Rom. 12:15.-In this verse we have two examples of the repetition of
the infinitive and participle.

“Rejoice with them that do rejoice (xaipeiv μετὰ Χαιρόντων,
chairein meta chairontqdbn), and weep with them that weep (κλαίειν
μετὰ κλαιόντων, klaiain meta klaiontdbn).”

Two other figures are combined here-Homoeopropheron and
Homeeoptoton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

Heb. 6:14.-“Surely blessing | will bless thee, and multiplying | will
multiply thee”: i.e., Surely in blessing | will most certainly bless thee,
etc.

(b) In strong negation
Gen. 3:4.-“And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely
die.”

Here the serpent emphatically denies Jehovah’s words, and says,
dying thou shalt not die.
He is thus introduced to us in his special sphere-denying the Word
of God. For he is the god of this world’s religion and not of its crimes
and immoralities. And his sphere is in the corruption of the truth rather
than in the degradation of the flesh.* [Note: See The Silence of God,
by Robert Anderson, LL.D., C.B., published by Hodder and
Stoughton.]

Exo. 5:23.-“Thou hast not delivered them at all.”

Thus beautifully is the figure rendered. Hebrew, delivering thou
hast not delivered them.

Exo. 34:7.-“And wilt by no means clear the guilty.” Hebrew, clearing
thou wilt not clear. Even so the Substitute of the Lord’s people was
not cleared. When he bore their sins he bore the punishment also that
was due to them.

Psa. 49:7 (8).-“None of them can by any means redeem his brother.”

Thus beautifully is the figure rendered, which the R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] has not attempted to improve.

Hebrew, a brother redeeming doth not redeem a man: i.e., even
though he pay down the price there is no redemption.
3. Verbs with cognate noun
A verb and a cognate noun are used together, when great emphasis is
placed upon the assertion or expression. It is a kind of superlative
degree in verbs to declare the magnitude and gravity of an action or
the greatness and importance of its results.
Gen. 1:11.-“Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed.”
Lit., seeding seed. Thus emphasizing the fact that trees, etc., were
created bearing the seeds: and not the seeds producing the trees. The
hen was created producing the egg, and not the egg producing the
hen. Thus, at the very outset of the Word of God, the modern figment
of “evolution” is exploded.
Gen. 8:21.-“And the Lord smelled a sweet savour.” Lit., smelled the
sweet smell, or the savour of rest: {6., Jehovah accepted the
sacrifice, and was satisfied with the atonement made by Noah.

The figure of Anthrapopatheia (q.v. [Note: Which see] ) is
involved.
Gen. 27:3.-“Take me some venison.” Lit., hunt me some hunting, {6.,
fetch me some game.

The Ixx. similarly expresses it θήρευσόν µοι θήραν.

Venison, so called from the Latin venatio, to hunt.
Gen. 27:33.-“And Isaac trembled very exceedingly.”
Thus beautifully is the Hebrew figure turned into an English idiom.
The Hebrew is: “And Isaac trembled with a great trembling
greatly.” (See margin).
Gen. 27:34.-“And ... Esau ... cried with a great and exceeding bitter
cry.”
Gen. 28:20.-“And Jacob vowed a vow,” i.e., solemnly vowed.
Gen. 30:8.-“And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have | wrestled
with my sister.” Lit., “with wrestlings of God, have | wrestled with my
sister’; where we have another figure, Enallage, by which the Noun “of
God?” is used instead of the adjective “great,” denoting therefore “with
very great and super-human wrestlings have | wrestled.” (See
Enallage).
Gen. 35:14.-“And Jacob set up a pillar lé6a i64a (vayatzev
maitzevah), lit., and he pillared a pillar. So verse 20.* [It seems clear
that this should be the reading also in Gen. 33:20, where we have the
same verb bbb (vayatzev), which means {ο stand or rear up, as
one lifts and sets up a (single) memorial stone which we now call a
Е
“menhir.” But the noun is different §)Lb:(mizbeach), which means an
altar. Some ancientan altar. Some ancientscribe either mistook
matzevah (a pillar) and wrote mizbeach (an altar), or the noun was
originally abbreviated by the use of the initial letter 7 (mem) and was
afterwards filled out incorrectly. Because the verb that always goes
with altar is tot (banah), to build, as with bricks, etc. (except in Gen.
35:1; Gen. 35:3 and Exo. 30:1, where it is oe (asah), to make; and
1Ki. 16:32, where it is eV] (kum), to raise or set up as a building, and
not O'OLL (natzav), fo stand up as a pillar).]
Num. 4:23.-“All that enter in to serve the service to work the work in
the Tabernacle of the congregation.”
Num. 11:4.-“And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a
lusting.” Hebrew, lusted a lust: {6., lusted exceedi
Num. 16:30.-“But if the Lord make a new thing.” Hebrew, create a
creation: i.e., do something wonderful.
1Sa. 4:5.-“All Israel shouted with a great shout”: i.e., with a very loud
and prolonged or sustained cry.
2Sa. 12:16.-“And David fasted,” Jit, fasted a fast: i.e., completely or
truly fasted.

2Sa. 13:36.-“And all his servants wept very sore.” In Hebrew the figure
is “wept a great weeping greatly.”

1Ki. 1:40.-“The people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great
joy”: i.e., their joy scarcely knew bounds.

2Ki. 4:13.-“Thou hast been careful for us with all this care”: ie.,
exceedingly careful.
2Ki. 13:14.-“Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness”: i.e., was
exceeding sick so that he died.

2Ki. 19:7.-“He shall hear a rumour,” lit, hear a hearing, * [Note: See
Metonymy (of adjunct).] ie., he shall hear important news, something
that will upset his plans.

Psa. 14:5; Psa. 53:5.-“There were they in great fear.” The Figure is
“they feared a fear.”

Psa. 144:6.-“Cast forth lightning.” Heb., lighten lightning, i-e., lighten
exceedingly, and destroy them.

Pro. 30:24.-“Wise, made wise.” Here, the emphasis created by the
repetition in the form of Polyptoton, makes a superlative adjective and
is beautifully and idiomatically rendered “exceeding wise.”

Man is by nature ignorant. He is born more ignorant than the
beasts. He has, therefore, to be “made wise”; and, in spiritual things,
this can be done only by the Holy Spirit of God.

Isa. 8:12.-“Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid (i.e., fearful).
Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear.”

Isa. 22:17.-“Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty
captivity.” This verse and the next are very difficult, as is attested by a
comparison of the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] with their marginal readings. The above words are literally,
“Behold, Jehovah will hurl thee with the hurling of a [strong] man.”
The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] expresses it: “The Lord
will hurl thee away violently.”
Jer. 22:16.-“He judged the cause.” Lit., He judged the judgment; i.e.,
righteously judged.

So Lam. 3:59.
Jer. 51:2.-“And will send unto Babylon fanners (créi, zareem) that
shall fan her lerla, vzerbiaha).”
Eze. 18:2.-“What mean ye that ye use this proverb? Heb.: juééi
rulaia é (mishleem eth-hammahshal). Lit., ye proverb this
proverb, i.e., ye have this proverb in constant use.
Eze. 38:12.-“То take a spoil, and to take a prey.” Lit., to spoil spoil
and to prey prey; i.e., to take great spoil and a great prey.
Dan. 11:3.-“A mighty King shall stand up that shall rule with a great
rule”; {6., have a vast dominion.
Jon. 1:10.-“Then were the men exceedingly afraid.” Lit., feared with
great fear.

Mic. 2:4.-‘In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
lament with a lamentation of lamentations”: {6., shall exceedingly
lament. Or, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] “lament with a doleful lamentation.” See
below, page 284.

Nah. 1:15 (2:1.).-“Keep thy solemn feasts.” Hebrew, Feast thy solemn
feasts.

The figure gives a superlative degree, as it were, to the verb,
implying that, before this, feasts had only been formally observed:
henceforth they are to be truly celebrated.

Hab. 3:2.-Ὁ Lord, | have heard thy speech, and was afraid.” Hebrew,
| have heard hearing of thee, i.e., | have heard thy fame.

Zec. 1:2.-“The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers.” The
figure is thus beautifully rendered. Lit., it is “Jehovah hath been
displeased with displeasure with your fathers.”

Verse 14. Ч am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great
jealousy,” {6., | am exceedingly jealous.
Verse 15. “I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
ease.” Lit., “with a great wrath am | wroth.”
Zec. 7:9.-“Execute true judgment.” Thus elegantly is the figure
expressed: “Judge judgment of truth.” See Joh. 7:24.

This Hebrew idiom appears in the New Testament, showing that
though the words are Greek the thoughts and idioms are Hebrew.
(See under Idioma).
Mat. 2:10.-“They rejoiced with exceeding great joy.” (ἐχάρησαν
χαράν, echareesan charan).

See this verge under Ellipsis.

Mar. 4:41.-“They feared exceedingly” (ἐφοβήθησαν — ФОВом,
ephobeetheesan phobon). Lit., they feared a fear.

Luk. 22:15.-“With desire | have desired to eat this passover with
you.”

Having translated the figure literally in the Text, the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] half
repents it, and gives the English idiom in the margin, “/ have heartily
desired.”

Joh. 6:28.-“What shall we do that we might work the works of God?”
i.e., might really do what God wills us to do.

Joh. 7:24.-“Judge righteous judgment” (τὴν δικαίαν κρίσιν κρίνατε,
teen dikaian krisin krinate). See Zec. 7:9.

Act. 23:12.-“Certain of the Jews banded together, and bound
themselves under a curse.” (Marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , or, with an
oath of execration).
And then, in verse 14, to emphasize this, they say, “We have
bound ourselves under a great curse.” ἀναθέματι ἀνεθεμαήσαμεν.
(anathemati anethematisamen.) Lit., we have vowed a great vow.

Anathematizo means to devote, and so to separate from;
especially to devote to destruction.

Eph. 6:18.-“Praying always with all prayer,” i.e., earnestly praying.
Col. 2:19.-“Increaseth with the increase of God” (αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν,
auxei teen auxeesin). Lit, increaseth the increase, i.e., receives
abundant increase from God, or worthy of God: or, receives Divine
increase.

1Ti. 1:18.-“That thou ... mightest war a good warfare” (στρατεύῃ
στρατείαν, strateuee strateian). This comes also under the figure of
Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).

2Ti. 4:7.-“| have fought a good fight” (τὸν ἀγῶνα τὸν καλὸν
ἠγώνισμαι, ton адфпа ton kalon eegapnismai): i.e., | have earnestly
fought the good fight.

Jam. 5:17.-“He prayed earnestly.” This is the beautiful rendering of the
figure προσευχῇ προσηύξατο (proseuchee proseeuxato) with prayer
he prayed. See Paronomasia.
Rev. 16:9.-“And men were scorched with great heat.” Lit., burnt with
great burning, i.e., exceedingly burnt.

Rev. 17:6.- wondered with great wonder’ (A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
admiration), i.e., | wondered exceedingly.

This figure exists even when the noun is absent through the figure
of Ellipsis:

Num. 11:14.-1 am not able to bear [the burden ой all this people
alone, because it, [/.e., the burden] is too heavy for me.”

Verse 17 shows that the word burden is implied; and that Moses
means, | am not able to bear the heavy burden of all this People
alone. (See under Ellipsis, page 56).

Psa. 13:3.-Here the noun is actually supplied in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] “Sleep
the sleep of death,” i.e, sleep the last solemn sleep of death.

4. Verbs with other parts of speech. (Combined Polyptoton)
Isa. 24:16.-“My leanness, my leanness,* [Note: This is the figure of
Epizeuxis (q.v.).] woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt
treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very
treacherously.”

Here, from the two roots “deal” and “treachery” is heaped together

this variety of inflections, to enhance the result of the enemy’s
treatment.
Hos. 10:1 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).-“Israel is a
luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit: according to the
multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars, according to the
goodness of his land they have made goodly pillars” ({6., images).
Here, in the repetition of the various inflections of the words “fruit,”
“multiply,” and “good,” and in the repetition of “according to”
(Anaphora), and in the repetition of sense in “altars” and “images,” our
attention is arrested and drawn to the fact that prosperity only led the
People astray into idolatry.
2Co. 10:12.-“For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or
compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
among themselves, are not wise.

This is still more emphatic when we see the structure of this verse.

а — For we are not bold (οὐ)

b — ю number (ἐγκρῖναι) or compare (συγκρῖναι) ourselves
ο with certain of them that commend themselves:
ο but they themselves, measuring themselves by
themselves,
b and comparing (συγκρίνοντες) themselves with
themselves

а are without understanding (οὐ).

Here in “a” and “a” we have the declaration, in “a” as to what we
are not, and in “a” as to what they are not.
In “b” and “b” we have comparison (συγκρίνω).

In “c” and “c” we have commending and measuring.

Note also that in “b” and “c” the pronoun occurs once, while in the
corresponding members it is answered by a double occurrence.

For the meaning of the verb “compare,” see below under

adjectives (page 284), and also under Ellipsis, page 77.
Gal. 5:7-10.-“Ye did run well: who did hinder you that ye should not
obey (πείθεσθαι, peithesthai) the truth? This persuasion (πεισµονή,
peismonee) cometh not of him that calleth you ... A little eaven
leaveneth* [Note: Another example of Polyptoton.] the whole lump. |
have confidence (πέποιθα, pepoitha) in you through the Lord, that ye
will be none otherwise minded.

Here we have three forms of the same word, or three words from
the same root. This is lost in the translation. ΓΠΠείθω (peithd) is more
than to believe, it is to be persuaded, to hold or hold on to a belief.
Hence, πεῖσμα (peisma) denotes a ship’s cable, by which it holds on,
and in which it trusts, while πεισµονή is a holding on, here (in verse 8)
evidently a holding on to one’s own views with obstinacy.

Perhaps the word “confidence” may best be repeated: “who did
hinder you that ye should not have confidence in the truth? This
self-confidence cometh not of him that calleth you ... but | have
confidence in you,” etc.
Eph. 1:3.-“Blessed (εὐλογητός, eulogeetos) be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed (0 εὔλογησας, ho
eulogeesas) us with all spiritual blessings (εὐλογία, eulogia) in
heavenly places (or spheres) in Christ”: i.e., who hath richly blessed
us with all, etc.
Il. Nouns and Pronouns

1. Nouns repeated in different cases
Eze. 28:2.-“Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the
Lord God (Adonai Jehovah): Because thine heart (GAC) is lifted up,
and thou hast said | am a God, | sit in the seat of God (2Th. 2:4) in
the heart (aéa, {8., in the heart) of the seas; yet thou art a man and
not God, though thou set thine heart (248) as the heart (GEA) of
God.”
Joh. 3:13.-“And no man hath ascended up to heaven (εἰς τὸν
οὐρανόν, eis ton ouranon), but He that came down from heaven (ἐκ
τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ek tou ouranou), even the Son of Man which is (or was)
in heaven (6 ®v ἐν τῷ oUpava, ho фп en @ ouranq).”

It is to be remembered that the last clause is doubtful. “Many
ancient authorities omit it,” as the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] remarks in the margin.
But, taking it as it stands, we have the three inflections of the word
“heaven,” calling our attention to a great fact that no one has ever
gone up to heaven that is by his own act (see Pro. 30:4), for the verb
“ascended” is active: and the tense is the Perfect, meaning no one
hath ascended up, and is in heaven. The verb, too, is πορευθείς
(poreutheis), intimating a leisurely journey, not an instantaneous
rapture.

It does not deny that men like Enoch and Elijah had been taken up
by God, which is a very different thing.

And then the expression 6 ὤν (ho qpn) is difficult to express in
English. It is /it., the one being, but it means here not “who is,” but who
was in heaven, i.e., before He came down as stated in chap. 1:1, and
who shall again “ascend up where He was before” (chap. 6:62).

So in chap. 1:18, it should be rendered “which was in the bosom of
the Father.”

Compare, for this sense, chaps, 9:25; 19:38. Luk. 24:44. 2Co. 8:9.
And see above, under Ellipsis (page 22), and Heterosis.

Rom. 4:18.-“Who against hope believed in hope (map ἐλπίδα ἐπ]
éATridi, par elpida ep elpidi).
Rom. 11:36.-“For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all
things.”
Gal. 2:19-20.-“For | through the law am dead (died) to the law (ἐγὼ
yap διὰ. νόµου νόμῳ ἀπέθανον, едф gar dia nomou noma
apethanon), that | might live (ζήσω, геезф) unto God. | am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live (ζῶ, zqb); yet not | but Christ liveth (2,
zee) in me, and that [/ife] which | now live (ζῶ, 2ф) in the flesh ! live
(ζῶ, 2ф) by the faith of the Son of God.”

See further on this verse under the figure of Epanadiplosis.

2. Nouns repeated in different numbers
(a) In singular and plural

Psa. 68:15-16 (16, 17).-In the Hebrew it is clearer than in the English,
because what in English requires two or more words, in Hebrew is
only one word, or a compound word.

“A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan.

A mountain of mountain peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
Why look ye askance (or envy) ye mountain peaks.

At the mountain which God hath desired for His abode?

Yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.”

Thus, is the Hill of Zion specially marked out as the place which
Jehovah chose for His House.

Isa. 2:11.-The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the
haughtiness of men shall be bowed down.

So also in verse 17, where the singular and plural are used
together (as here) to emphasize the far reaching effects of the day of
the Lord, here (verse 12) mentioned for the first time in the Bible.

In other places also we have the same figure: and it tells us that
God makes a distinction between “man” and “men,” opposite to that
which the world makes.

As for “man” God has condemned him root and branch, while the
world would deify him.

As for “men” God saves and blesses them with an everlasting
salvation, while the world makes very little of “men” as individuals, and
indeed pursues them with persecutions, and fights against them with
“wars and hatreds.”

See further on this whole passage, under the figures of
Polysyndeton and Synonymia.
Jer. 15:16.-“Thy words were found, and | did eat them; and thy word
was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.”

Here the two numbers (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.]
and pl. [Note: |. The Plural Number.] ) in close conjunction, bring out
the contrast between the separate “words” and the “word” of God as a
whole.

Compare Joh. 17:8; Joh. 17:14; Joh. 17:17.

(b) In singular and genitive plural

A noun is repeated in the genitive plural in order to express very
emphatically the superlative degree which does not exist in Hebrew.
See under Idiom.
Thus this figure is a kind of Enallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), or
exchange, by which a noun in the genitive plural, is used instead of a
superlative adjective.

Gen. 9:25.-“A servant of servants shall [Canaan] be”: i.e., the lowest
and most degraded of servants, or the most abject slave.

Exo. 26:33, etc.-“Holy of holies.” In A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “the most holy.”
Num. 3:32.-“Chief of the chief.” In A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “chief over the
chief.”

Deu. 10:17.-“For Jehovah your Elohim is Elohai of the Elohim, and
Adonai of the Adonim, a great ΕΙ.”" [Note: See in Divine Names and
Titles, by the same author and publisher.]

In A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
this is rendered, “The Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of
Lords, a great God,” etc.
1Ki. 8:27.-The heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee”:
ie., the highest heaven.”
Ecc. 1:2, etc.-“Vanity of vanities’: i.e., the greatest vanity.

Song Son. 1:1.-“The song of songs,” i.e., the most beautiful or
excellent song.

Dan. 2:37. Eze. 26:17.-“A king of kings”: {6., the most mighty king.
Dan. 2:47.-“God of gods”: i.e., the great, living, or true God. The most
mighty God.

Dan. 8:25.-“The Prince of princes”: {6., the most powerful Prince.
Hos. 10:15.-“So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great
wickedness.” The figure is here translated, and given in the margin
“Hebrew, the evil of your evil.”

Mic. 2:4.-‘A lamentation of lamentations,” /.е., a great lamentation.
See above, page 278.

Php. 3:5.-“A Hebrew of the Hebrews,” i.e., a thorough Hebrew. See
this verse under Asyndeton.

1Ti. 6:15.-“The King of kings, and Lord of lords.” Compare Rev.
17:14; Rev. 19:16.

Rev. 1:6.-“The ages of the ages,” i.e., to the remotest age, for ever
and ever.
Ill. Adjectives

1Со. 2:13.-“Comparing spiritual things with spiritual.” In the Greek it
is πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συγκρίνοντες (pneumatikois pneumatika
sunkrinontes), i.e., to spiritual persons spiritual things declaring.

Or, as in the English order, “declaring (sunkrinontes, see Num.
15:34) spiritual things (pneumatika, neuter plural) to spiritual persons
(pneumatikois, masculine gender dative plural).* [Note: Compare
chap. 3:1; and see The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.
And see under Ellipsis, page 77.]
2Co. 9:8.-“And God is able to make all (πᾶσαν, pesan), grace abound
toward you; that ye always having all sufficiency in all things (παντὶ
πάντοτε πᾶσαν, panti pantote pesan) may abound to every (all) (πᾶν,
pen) good work.”
