Gen. 3:22.-“Behold, the man is become as one of us”: i.e., he had
become, not necessarily or really “a God,” but what the tempter
promised him; and now he will get the Tempter’s doom and be cast
out from God's presence.
Isa. 44:25.-“That turneth wise men backward”: i.e., those who are
accounted wise by themselves or others. Not those who are truly and
really wise in God's sight. So the word “knowledge” is used in the next
sentence by Antiphrasis.
