See Exo. 15:9 (see Asyndeton). Psa. 137:7; Psa. 144:12-15 (see
Ellipsis). Î™58. 14:13-14; Isa. 28:15. Hos. 14:2-3. Eze. 36:2. Mic. 2:11;
Mic. 3:11.

So also 1Co. 15:35, and Php. 3:4-5.

Sometimes there is a use of a word which another is wont to use,
and which is repeated so as delicately, but yet acutely, to direct him
aright. As in 2Co. 10:1; 2Co. 10:10; and Gal. 6:2.
