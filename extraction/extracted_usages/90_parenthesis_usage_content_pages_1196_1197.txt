Heb. 2:9.-“But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the

ye do well that ye take heed (as unto a light that shineth in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise) in your hearts.”
Here, it is clear that there must be a parenthesis, for it is prophecy
that is the light that shines, and Christ and His appearing are the Day-
star and the Day-dawn. Surely, the meaning cannot be that we are
exhorted to take heed to the prophetic word until Christ is revealed in
our hearts! No; but we are to take heed in our hearts to this prophetic
