1. Parcemice which are quoted as being already in use as such
Gen. 10:9.-“He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is
said, ‘Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord’ ” (Π.Ν. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] ).
Num. 21:27.-“Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, ‘Come into
Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared,’ ” etc.

Three strophes are given from a popular poem, introduced by the
word “wherefore.”

The first (-27, 28) is an ironical call to the Amorites to rebuild their
city Heshbon, which Israel had destroyed (see verses 25, 26).

The second (verse 29) is a prophecy of Moab’s ruin.

The third (verse 30) is the justification of the woe pronounced in
verse 29.

Verse 30 is obscure, because of the reading of the letter ? in
22? which, according to Massorah, is one of the fifteen cases in
which words, etc., are dotted. The letter (2) ought, therefore, to be
cancelled. In this case 22 (ish), man, is put for 22? (ish), men, and
22222 (vannashsheem), we have laid them waste, would then be
the plural of 22? (isshah): women.

The strophe would then read:-
“We have shot at them,
Heshbon is destroyed even unto Dibon,
The women also even unto Nopha,
And the men even unto Medeba.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s
Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, pp. 326-328.]
1Sa. 10:12.-"Therefore it became a proverb: ‘Is Saul also among the
prophets?’ ”
1Sa. 24:13.-“As saith the proverb of the ancients, ‘Wickedness
proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.’ ”
2Sa. 20:18.-“They were wont to speak in old time, saying, ‘They shall
surely ask counsel at Abel’: and so they ended the matter.”
Jer. 31:29.-“In those days they shall say no more, ‘The fathers have
eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’ ”
This is what they did once say. See Eze. 18:2-3.
Eze. 16:44.-“Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this
proverb against thee, saying: ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’ ”
See 19:2, 3.
Luk. 4:23.-“Ye will surely say unto me this proverb: ‘Physician, heal
thyself ”

This was a well known proverb. It may be found in the Talmud,
“Physician, heal thine own lameness.”* [Note: Beresh. rab. sect. 23,
and in Tanchuma, fol. 4. 2.]

Joh. 1:46 (47).-“Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?”

This appears from 7:41, 42, 52, to have been a proverb already in
use.

Joh. 4:37.-“And herein is that saying true; ‘One soweth, and another
reapeth.’”
2Pe. 2:22.-“But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb
(Pro. 26:11):

“The dog is turned to his own vomit again;

And the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.”
When we contrast this with 1Pe. 2:25, we see how forcible is the
difference between the saved sinner and the “reformed character.”
The saint may go astray, and the ungodly may reform; but they both
turn again, the one to his Shepherd, and the other to his mire! There is
all the difference in the world between a dirty sheep and a washed
sow! It is not that which goeth into the mouth that defileth the man, but
that which cometh out of the heart (Mat. 15:17-20).

The mouth, dish, or sepulchre, may be cleansed or whitened
without, but within it is all uncleanness (Mat. 23:25-28).

“Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on
the heart” (1Sa. 16:7).

Truly “the Lord seeth not as man seeth.”

How many hirelings are there who are engaged in merely washing
sows and amusing goats, instead of seeking out and feeding Christ’s
harassed and scattered and famishing sheep, who are at their wits’
end to know where to find a little green grass, or fresh water, which
has not been trodden down with the feet of the goats, or defiled with
the “vomit” of the dogs?
2. Parcemice which, though not quoted as such, were very
probably already in use as proverbial expressions
“Like to a grain of mustard seed” (Mat. 13:31-32; Mat. 17:20. Luk.
17:6). This was doubtless a proverbial saying among the Hebrews
(not the Greeks), to indicate a very small thing: as we say, of rent, etc.,
“a peppercorn.” See Buxtorf Lex. Talmud, under the word 2222, and
above, under Ellipsis and Synecdoche.

“As the sand of the sea,” or “as the sand.” This was used
proverbially, in order to express a vast multitude that could not be
numbered.

See Gen. 22:17; Gen. 32:12; Gen. 41:49. Jos. 11:4. Jdg. 7:12.
1Sa. 13:5. 2Sa. 17:11. 1Ki. 4:20; 1Ki. 4:29 (5:9). Job. 29:18. Psa.
78:27; Psa. 139:18. Isa. 10:22; Isa. 48:19. Jer. 15:8; Jer. 33:22. Hos.
1:10 (2:1). Hab. 1:9. And in the New Testament- Rom. 9:27. Heb.
11:12; and Rev. 20:8. See under Hyperbole.

“As the dust of the earth,” or “dust,” is used proverbially, by
Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), for an innumerable multitude.

See Gen. 13:16; Gen. 28:14. Num. 23:10.* [Note: Num. 23:10. The
A.V. renders this “Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number
the fourth part of Israel.” The R.V. renders the second line, “Or number
the fourth part of Israel’; and in the margin says, “Heb., Or, by
number.” But Dr. Ginsburg points out in his Introduction to the Hebrew
Bible (p. 168), that the word 190m: (umispahr), rendered “and the
number,” is obscure, because the first two letters ог were originally a
separate word, being the abbreviation of the first word of the first line,
viz.: Ol for ‘1, and who. Thus the two lines (dividing the word into two)
are now seen to be a beautiful parallel:-

“Who can count the dust of Jacob?

And who can number the fourth part of Israel?”] 2Ch. 1:9. Job.
22:24; Job. 27:16. Psa. 78:27. Zep. 1:17. Zec. 9:3. See under
Hyperbole.

“As the stars of heaven,” or “as the stars,” is used proverbially to
indicate a vast number that could not be counted.

See Gen. 15:5; Gen. 22:17; Gen. 26:4. Exo. 32:13. Deu. 1:10;
Deu. 10:22; Deu. 28:62. 1Ch. 27:23. Neh. 9:23. Jer. 33:22. Nah. 3:16.
“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle” (Mat.
19:24. Mar. 10:25. Luk. 18:25). This was a proverbial expression for a
thing very unusual and very difficult. Lightfoot (Ногое Hebraicae)
quotes several examples: from the Talmud,* [Note: Baby1. Berachoth.
fol. 55, 2.] where, concerning dreams, it says “They do not show a
man а palm-tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a
needle.” The gloss is, “A thing which he was not wont to see, nor
concerning which he had ever thought.” Another example is
given,t [Note: Baba Mezia, fol. 38, 2.] where Rabbi Sheshith
answered R. Areram, disputing with him, and asserting something that
was incongruous of him, and said, “Perhaps thou art one of these
Pombeditha, who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a
needle”: i.e., as the Aruch interprets it, “Who speak things that are
impossible.”

“That strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel” (Mat. 23:24). Not
“straining at a gnat.” See Buxtorf in Lex. Talmud, under 222.

“With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again”
(Mat. 7:2). This was a very common proverb among the Jews, See
Bab. Sanhedrim, fol. 100, 1, and the Tract Sotah cap. 1, quoted by
Lightfoot.
“Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye,” etc. (Mat. 7:4).
Lightfoot quotes from the Baba Bathra, fol. 15, 2, a well known
proverb: “It is written in the days when they judged the judges (i.e., in
the generation which judged their judges), When any [judge] said to
another ‘Cast out the mote out of thine eye,’ he answered, ‘Cast you
out the beam out of your own eye,’ ” etc.

“There shall not an hair of your head perish,” etc. (Luk. 21:18. Act.
27:34; and, in the Old Testament, 1Sa. 14:45. 2Sa. 14:11. 1Ki. 1:52.
Compare also Mat. 10:30.

“Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased: and he that shall
humble himself shall be exalted” (Mat. 23:12. Luk. 14:11). Many
similar sayings might be quoted from the Talmud. See Erubim, cap. i.
Indeed, it was very ancient. See Job. 5:11; Job. 22:29. Psa. 18:27
(28); 113:6 (7). Pro. 29:23, and the song of Hannah (1Sa. 2:6-8), and
of Mary (Luk. 1:52:53).

“Shake off the dust of your feet” (Mat. 10:14. Mar. 6:11. Luk. 9:5.
And Act. 13:51). The schools of the Scribes taught that the dust of
heathen lands caused defilement.{ [Note: Tosaph. ad Kelim, cap, 1.
Bah. Sanhedr., fol. 12. 1. Bab. Shabb, fol. 15. 2. Gloss in Sanhedr.,
fol. 5. 2. Tosaph. in Sanhedr., cap. 1, article 30, quoted by Lightfoot.]
The shaking off of the dust of the feet, therefore, was a sign that,
though the place might be in the land of Israel, it was as though it
were a heathen and profane and defiled place.

“It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
servant as his lord,” etc. (Mat. 10:25. Luk. 6:40. Joh. 13:16).* [Note:
See the Talmud. Berachoth, cap. 9 and Chusar, cap. 20. Also Aben
Ezra on Hos. 1:2.]

“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation,” etc.
(Mat. 12:25. Mar. 3:24-25. Luk. 11:17. (See Buxtorf. Lex. Talmud,
under 222).

“To remove mountains” (Mat. 21:21._1Co. 13:2) was a Hebrew
proverb, as may be seen in Buxtorf. Lex. Ta/mud, under 222. It was
common to say of a great teacher that he was “a rooter up of
mountains.” (See Bab. Berachoth, fol. 64. 1; Erubim, fol. 29. 1;
Sanhedrim, fol. 24. 1; Baba Bathra, fol. 3. 2). And thus what they
foolishly said of the learning of their wisest men, Christ said of His
humblest disciple. In 1Co. 13:2, knowledge and faith are combined by
this Parcemia.
“Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them: for this is the Law and the Prophets” (Mat. 7:12. Luk. 6:31. (See
Talmud, Bab. Sabbath, fol. 31.1, and Buxtorf. Lex. Talmud, under
22%),

“To unloose the shoe-latchet” (Mat. 3:11. Mar. 1:7. Luk. 3:16) was
a proverb connected with the buying of a servant: the loosening of the
shoe being a token of purchase. See Rth. 4:7-8; and Bah. Kiddushin,
fol. 22. 2, cap. 1.

“If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the
dry?” (Luk. 23:31), or better (comparing Mat. 3:10 : “Now, also the axe
is laid unto the root of the trees.”)

“If to a green tree, these things they are doing;
To the dry tree, what shall happen?’t [Note: Talmud

Sanhedrim, quoted by Drusius.]

Le., if they deal thus with Me, a green and flourishing Tree, what
shall happen to the nation-a dry and sapless trunk, when the Romans
shall presently lay their axe to it? (See Psa. 1:1-6, and Jer. 17:5-8).

“It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks” (Act. 9:5; Act. 26:14.
This was a proverb common among the Greeks as well as the
Hebrews.

3. Parcemice which appear for the first time in Scripture; but, which,
owing to their fulness of meaning and their wide application, have
since passed into general use as proverbial sayings
Gen. 22:14.-“As it is said to this day, ‘In the mount of the Lord it shall

be seen.’”
Deu. 25:4 is a Scripture which afterward became a proverb, because
it is a brief sententious saying with many applications. “Thou shalt not
muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn (marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] , Heb. thresheth). See 1Co. 9:9 and 1Ti. 5:18.
1Ki. 8:46. 2Ch. 6:36.-“For there is no man that sinneth not.” This
became a proverb on account of its great truth, as may be seen from
Pro. 20:9. Ecc. 7:20. Jam. 3:2. 1Jn. 1:8; 1Jn. 1:10.
1Ki. 20:11.-This also has come down to, and is used by posterity as a
proverb, full of meaning, and with many applications:

“Let not him that girdeth on his harness

Boast himself as he that putteth it off.”
Job. 6:5.-“Doth the wild ass bray when he is at grass? or loweth the
ox over his fodder?” (See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin).

Job. 14:19.-“The waters wear the stones.”

Job. 28:18.-“The price of wisdom is above rubies.”

Psa. 62:9.-“Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high
degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter
than vanity.”

Psa. 111:10.-“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” So
Deu. 4:6. Job. 28:28. Pro. 1:7; Pro. 9:10. Ecc. 12:13. Probably the first
use is in Job. 28:28, but it passed into a common proverb.

Pro. 1:17.-“Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.”
Pro. 1:32.-“The prosperity of fools shall destroy them.”

Pro. 3:12.-“For whom the Lord loveth He correcteth: even as a father
the son in whom he delighteth.” Here we have a Simile as well. It is
referred to in Heb. 12:5-6. See also Job. 5:17. Psa. 94:12, and Rev.
3:19.

Pro. 6:6.-“Go to the ant, thou sluggard: consider her ways and be
wise.” Compare Job. 12:7.
Pro. 6:27.-“Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
burned?” This is doubtless a saying arising from common observation
of daily life.
Pro. 10:5.-“He that gathereth in summer is a wise son.”
Pro. 10:13.-“А rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.”
So Pro. 26:3.

Verse 19: “In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.”
Pro. 11:15.-“He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it.” Heb.
shall be sore broken (so A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin). The common experience of
this fact has made this a common proverb; but they are blessed
indeed who learn and know from a happy experience that when Christ
became Surety for His People, who were “strangers,” He smarted for
it, and was “sore broken” that they might be for ever blessed.
Pro. 22:6.-“Train up a child in the way he should go.”

Few proverbs have passed more into common use than this. Mr.
C. H. Spurgeon once put it, “in the way you wish you had gone
yourself.” See under Pleonasm and Metonymy.
Pro. 26:11.-“As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
folly.”

This is also a simile, which passed into a proverb. See 2Pe. 2:22,
quoted and referred to above.
Pro. 27:6.-‘Faithful are the wounds of a friend.”

Verse 7: “The full soul loatheth the honeycomb.”

Verse 17: “As iron sharpeneth iron,” etc.
Pro. 28:21.-“То have respect of persons is not good.”

See Synecdoche, and Pro. 18:5; Pro. 24:23.
Ecc. 1:15.-“That which is crooked cannot be made straight.” Ecc.
7:13. Job. 12:14. Isa. 14:27.

This perhaps gave rise to another expressive Hebrew proverb:
“You cannot straighten a pig's tail.”
Ecc. 1:18.-“For in much wisdom is much grief.” So Ecc. 12:12.
Ecc. 9:4.-“For a living dog is better than a dead lion.”
Ecc. 10:1.-“Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send
forth a stinking savour.”

See under Ellipsis.
Ecc. 11:6.-“In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
not thine hand.”
Jer. 13:23.-“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
spots?”
Jer. 23:28.-“What is the chaff (Heb., straw) to the wheat?”
Hab. 2:6.-“Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him that increaseth that
which is not his! How long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick
clay’ ” (see R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).
Mal. 2:10.-“Have we not all one father?” The Jews used this proverb
in their controversy with the Lord in Joh. 8:33; Joh. 8:39, etc.
Mat. 5:13.-“If the salt have lost his savour (or taste) wherewith shall it
be salted?”
Mat. 5:14.-“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.”
Mat. 6:3.-“Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.”
Mat. 6:21.-“Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
Greek, “there will your heart also be,” with emphasis on “heart.” (See
Metonymy).
Mat. 6:24.-“No man can serve two masters.” See Hermeneia.

Verse 34: “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
Mat. 7:16.-“Ye shall know them by their fruits.”

These words were first used by the Lord concerning false
teachers. But to-day the saying has passed into general use, and is
spoken (not so correctly) of every one.

Mat. 9:12.-“They that be whole need not a physician.”

Mat. 10:10.-“The workman is worthy of his meat.” So Luk. 10:7. 1Co.
9:7, etc.

Verse 22: “He that endureth to the end shall be saved.” This
Paroemia is further used Dan. 12:12. Mat. 24:13. Mar. 13:13, etc. and
refers to the faithful remnant of Jews enduring to the end of the
coming “great tribulation.” The τέλος (telos), end, should be
distinguished from the συντέλεια (sunteleia), which is also translated
end.
The latter word is used of the time of the end, while the former
(telos) is used of the end or crisis of the sunteleia. The sunteleia refers
to the consummation of all the ages and dispensations; a joining
together of the ages, or ends, as it were, and is used of the whole time
of the “great tribulation”; while the {είος is the point of time at the end
of it. It is of this point that this saying is used: “He that endureth to the
end (fe/os) shall be saved (or delivered).”

The word συντέλεια (sunteleia) occurs only in Mat. 13:39-40; Mat.
13:49; Mat. 24:3; Mat. 28:20, and Heb. 9:26. It will be easy, therefore,
for the student to distinguish it from τέλος (telos), which is used in the
other passages.

Mat. 12:34.-“For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.”

Mat. 13:57.-“A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country
and in his own house.”

Mat. 15:14.-“If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”
Mat. 24:28.-“For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
gathered together.” The word “for” introduces the Paroemia, which is
from Job. 39:30. “Her young ones suck up blood: and where the slain
are, there is she.” Had this Parcemia been understood, and the title
“Son of Man” noticed as referring to Christ’s title as exercising
dominion in the Earth,* [Note: See The Divine Names and Titles, by
the same author and publisher. One shilling.] these words would
never have been interpreted of the church as the “Body” of Christ.
Luk. 17:37 clearly shows that it is a time of judgment (see verses
24-37); and that the taking and the /eaving refer to judgment, and not
to the Rapture of 1Th. 4:17; which was a subsequent revelation, and
ought not to be read into the Gospels, which are perfectly clear
without it.

Mar. 9:50.-See Mat. 5:13.

Luk. 17:37.-See Mat. 24:28 above.

Act. 9:5.-“It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks”: i.e., the goads.
Act. 20:35.-“It is more blessed to give than to receive.” This is one of
the un-recorded Paroemice or Logia of Christ. But it does not follow
that a papyrus which professes, some centuries later, to give other
Parcemice is genuine and authentic.

1Co. 5:6.-“А little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.” Leaven is always
used in a bad sense. Even in the case of one of the two wave-loaves,
leaven was to be used because that loaf represented human nature;
while the other loaf which represented Christ's perfect nature had no
leaven.
See other examples of such Proverbs in Pro. 11:27; Pro. 12:11;
Pro. 12:15; Pro. 15:2; Pro. 15:33; Pro. 17:1; Pro. 17:10; Pro. 17:19;
Pro. 17:28; Pro. 19:2; Pro. 19:24; Pro. 20:4; Pro. 20:11; Pro. 20:14;

Non-Canonical, or, Supposed Scripture, Proverbs
There are many common sayings which are supposed to be in
Scripture, even by those who should know better; and pass current
among those who are ill-informed. For example-

“God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.”
This is not in the Bible; but is taken from Laurence-Sterne’s
Sentimental Journey. And he took it probably from the French of Henri
Etienne, Dieu mesure le froid x la brebis tondue. And both may have
been acquainted with Isa. 27:8 : “He stayeth his rough wind in the day
of his east wind.”

“Spare the rod and spoil the child.”

Many use this, thinking it is Scripture. Even Butler, in his Hudibras,
says: “That may be heard ten times to one quotation of Solomon.” And
yet Solomon said: “He that spareth the rod hateth his son” (Pro.
13:24).

“A word to the wise is sufficient.” (Sometimes “for them” is added,
whereas it is singular, not plural).

This has been quoted as Scripture. But it is from the Latin of
Terence* [Note: Phormio, Act. 3:1-26 sc. 3. 5:8. In Parry's edition of
Terence, he says in a note that the Proverb is found in Plautus Persa
4:7. 18.] ; who himself is misquoted; for he said: “Dictum sapienti sat
est,” not Verbum sat sapienti.

It is said that the celebrated Robert Hall once planned a sermon
on the words
“In the midst of life we are in death,”

But he abandoned it, we are told, when he found that it was not to
be found in the Bible; but only in the Prayer-book.

It appears to have come from a monk of St. Gall, named Notker, in
the tenth century, whose Latin hymn contained the line: “Media vita in
morte sumus.”

Misquoted Proverbial Sayings
Even in quoting common sayings from Scripture and the Prayer Book,
which have passed into Proverbs, there is an habitual misquotation
which has become practically universal. It may not be out of place to
give one or two examples by way of warning.

“Man is prone to sin as the sparks fly upward.” But Job. 5:7 says:
“Man is born unto trouble,” etc.

“A still small voice” is generally quoted as “the still small voice”
(Ki. 19:12)

“A merciful man is merciful to his beast.” But Pro. 12:10 has it: “A
righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.”
“The truth as it is in Jesus” is almost invariably thus quoted. The
Scripture says (Eph. 4:21): “As the truth is in Jesus,” which is a very
different thing. The former implies that there is truth apart from Him.
But the latter implies that the truth is in Jesus, and nowhere else.

“A nation shall be born in a day.” No concordance will give this
passage. Isa. 66:8 asks: “Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one
day? or shall a nation be born at once?”

“So plain that he who runs may read.” On the contrary. So plain
was to be the written vision that he who reads it may run, and flee
from the coming judgments (Hab. 2:2).

“My time is in thy hand.” Thank God, He said “times” (Psa. 31:15
(16)). Yes, “My times are always in thy hand.” All my times: my times
of sorrow and of joy; of trouble and of danger. All are in the hand of my
God.* [Note: Shakespeare is misquoted in the other direction. He said:
“The time is out of joint,” not the times are out of joint. The next line
would set people right, for he says:-

“The time is out of joint;-O cursed spite!

That | was born to set it right.”
(Hamlet, Acti. sc. 4, at the close).

So Cowper: “The cups that cheer,” not cup. (See his Task, 4:39,
