2Ki. 19:7.-“Behold | will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
rumour, and shall return to his own land: aud | will cause him to fall
by the sword in his own land.”

The repetition greatly emphasizes the fact stated.
Isa. 8:12.-“Say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people
shall say a confederacy.”
There is the figure also of Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) in
“say ye” and “shall say.”
Mar. 5:2-3.-“And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there
met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who had his
dwelling among the tombs.”
