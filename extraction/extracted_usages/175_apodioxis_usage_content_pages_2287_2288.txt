Psa. 50:16.-“But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
mouth?”

Isa. 1:12-15 is a solemn expression of Jehovah’s detestation of
religion, per se, such as existed among, and was manifested by, the
Jews at Christ's first coming. This passage describes the most minute
attention to every religious observance, which only heightens the
indignation with which the Lord repudiates it all, because it does not
proceed from the heart.

See this passage also under Ellipsis, Anthropopatheia,
Synathroesmus, and Hypotyposis.

Jer. 9:2 (1).-We have Jeremiah’s detestation of Israel’s idolatry.

Mat. 4:10.-“Get thee hence, Satan:” etc.

Mat. 16:23.-“He ... said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou
art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of
God.”

The fact of this repulsion following so closely upon the other words
addressed to Peter in verses 17, 18, should have for ever precluded
the Romish perversion of them.

Act. 8:20-23.-Peter repels with horror the thought of Simon Magus
that the gift of the Holy Ghost could be purchased with money.
