Mar. 12:30.-"This is the first commandment.” In the Greek this
sentence consists of three words, each ending with the same syllable:
αὕτη πρώτη ἐντολή (hautee ргфее entolee); and thus our attention is
called to this weighty saying.
1Pe. 1:3-4.-“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.”

Here, the Homaeoteleuton emphasizes the wondrous character of
this inheritance:-

ἄφθαρτον,  ἁμίαντον, ἅμαιραντον (aphtharton, amianton,
amaranton), uncorruptible, undefiled, unfading. It is difficult accurately
to reproduce the sound of this in English; except in marking it by the
voice in reading aloud.

We might say, incorruptible, indefilable, indestructible, but this
would be at the expense of exact accuracy in translating.
