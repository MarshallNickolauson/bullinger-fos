|. Of Forms and Voices
1. Intransitive for Transitive
Mat. 5:29.-“If thy right eye offend thee”: (σκανδαλίζω, skandalizq), to
make to stumble: i.e., make thee stumble. So Mat. 18:6. 1Co. 8:13.
Mat. 5:45.-“He maketh his sun to rise” (ἀνατέλλω, anatellq), to rise
up.

1Co. 2:2.-“| determined not to know anything among you”: i.e., to
make known, preach.

1Со. 3:6.-“God gave the increase,” and verse 7: “God that giveth the
increase.” So 2Co. 9:10. In all other places the verb αὐξάνω
(аихапф), to increase, is intransitive.

1Co. 13:12.-“Then shall | know, even as | also am known”: {6., | shall
be made to know or taught.

2Co. 2:14.-“Now, thanks be to the God that always causeth us to
triumph.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] recognises the figure of exchange; as also
in

2Со. 9:8.-“God is able to make all grace abound in you.”

Gal. 4:9.-“But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known
of God”: {6., been made to know, or been instructed by God.

Eph. 1:8.-“According to the riches (or wealth) of His grace which
(grace) he hath made to overflow into us.”

2Ti. 2:19.-“The Lord knoweth them that are his”: i.e., the Lord maketh
known who are His; as in Num. 16:5.

2. Active for Passive
1Pe. 2:6.-“Wherefore also it is contained in the Scriptures,” Jit, it
contains: i.e., there is a passage in the Scripture.

3. Middle for Passive
Luk. 2:5.-“To be taxed with Mary”: /it., to enrol himself.
1Со. 10:2.-“And were all baptized into Moses”: lit, baptized
themselves.

Il. Heterosis of Moods

1. Indicative for Subjunctive

As the Hebrew language has no subjunctive mood, the indicative is
often put instead of that mood; and this is done in the New Testament,
as well as in the Old Testament, inasmuch as, though the language is
Greek, the thoughts and idioms are Hebrew.
1Co. 15:12.-“Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead,
how say some among you,” etc.: i.e., how is it that some among you
say.

Verse 35. “But some men wilt say”: /.e., may say.

Verse 50. “Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption”: i.e., neither
can corruption, etc.

2. Subjunctive for Indicative

Mat. 11:6.-“Blessed is he who may not be made to stumble”: i.e., who
is not made to stumble or seeth nothing to stumble at in me.
Joh. 15:8.-“By this is my Father glorified, that ye may bear much fruit”:
ie., that ye bear or when ye bear, etc.
1Co. 6:4.-“If, then, ye may have matters of judgment” (cases for the
judge): i.e., if ye have.
Jam. 4:13.-“To-day or to-morrow we may go into such a city”: i.e., we
will go.

Verse 15: “If the Lord should will, and we should live”: i.e., if He
willeth, and we live.
Some Christians say, “If the Lord should tarry;” not perceiving that
He may tarry, and yet not will that we should live, or do this or that.
Tarrying and willing are two very different things.
3. Imperative for Indicative
Gen. 20:7.-“For he (Abraham) is a prophet, and let him pray for thee”:
ie., (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] ), he shall pray for thee.
Gen. 42:18.-“This do ye and live”: i.e., and ye shall live.
Gen. 45:18.-‘I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye
the fat of the land”: {6., ye shall eat (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ).
Deu. 32:50.-And be gathered unto thy people”: i.e., thou shalt be
gathered.
Psa. 22:8 (9).-“Roll thyself on, or trust thou in the Lord.”

Whatever part of the verb aé (σφ!) may be, it must be-put for the
indicative, for it is so rendered in the Septuagint (“He trusted in the
Lord”), and is so quoted in the New Testament (Mat. 27:43).

Psa. 37:27.-“Depart from evil and do good: and dwell for evermore”:
ie., thou shalt dwell.
Pro. 3:4.-“So shalt thou find favour.”
Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] recognizes the figure, for the Heb. is imperative,
“find.” But the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] misses it in 4:4. “Keep my commandments
and live”: i.e., and thou shalt live.

Rom. 5:1.-“Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with
God.”

Here the reading, according to the R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] and the Textual critics, should be ἔχωμεν (imperative),
instead of ἔχομεν (indicative), as in the T.R. and A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] Alford,
though he recognizes the reading, and puts it in the text, yet bows to
the overwhelming evidence of the sense, and the context, and
contends for the Indicative. The simple solution is that this is one of
the instances, if the critics are right, in which the Imperative is used for
the Indicative, and though the text may say “let us have,” the meaning
is “we have.”
1Со. 16:22.-‘If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
Anathema Maran-atha”: i.e., he is or will be Anathema (or accursed)
when the Lord shall come.
In prophetic utterances the future indicative is very often declared
by the imperative; for “Whatsoever the Lord willeth, that doeth he.”
Isa. 8:10.-“Take counsel together ... speak the word”: i.e., ye shall
take counsel together, and it will come to naught: and ye shall speak
the word, but it will not stand.” So also 29:9; 37:30; 54:1, etc.
Joh. 2:19.-“Destroy this temple.” This was not a command for the
Jews to destroy Him, but a prophesy that they would do so. When
they perverted His words, they did not do so by taking the figure
literally, but by declaring that He said “I will destroy this temple.”
Gal. 6:2.-“And so fulfil (/.e., so ye will fulfil) the law of Christ.”
Jam. 5:1.-“Weep and howl:” i.e., ye shall weep and howl.

4. Imperative for Subjunctive

Num. 24:21.-“Strong be thy dwelling place, and build in the flint-rock
thy nest. Nevertheless”: i.e., thou mayest put, but,” etc. A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] :
“Thou puttest” (Ind. [Note: The Indicative Mood.] ), but the sense is
subjunctive.
Psa. 4:4 (5).-“Stand in awe, and sin not”: i.e., if ye stand in awe ye will
not sin.

Nah. 3:14.-Here, all the imperative commands are conditional
declarations, as is shown by verse 15: i.e., the people might do all
these things, nevertheless, it would be all in vain.

Luk. 10:28.-“This do, and thou shalt live”: /.e., if thou do this. Hence
the Imperative very often implies only permission:-
2Sa. 18:23.-“Run”: i.e., thou mayest run.
1К!. 22:22.-“Со forth, and do 5ο”: i.e., thou mayest go, and do it.
2Ki. 2:17.-“Send”: i.e., ye may send.
Mat. 8:32.-“Со”: i.e., ye may go.
1Co. 7:15.-“Let him depart”: i.e., he may depart.
1Co. 11:6.-“Let her also be shorn”: i.e., she may be shorn.

5. Infinitive for Indicative
Gen. 8:5.-“And the waters were in going and returning”: i.e., as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] , decreased continually.
Exo. 8:15 (11).-“But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, and to
harden his heart, and hearkened not unto them”: i.e., hardening of his
heart followed, or took place.
2Sa. 3:18.-“By the hand of my servant David to save my people
Israel”: i.e., | shall save.
1Ki. 22:30 and 2Ch. 18:29.-“And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat: To disguise myself and to enter into the battle”: | will
disguise myself; or as in margin [when he was] to disguise, etc.

2Ch. 31:10.-“Since the People began to bring the offerings into the
House of the Lord, to eat, to be satisfied, and to have left plenty”: /.е.,
we have eaten, and had enough, and have left plenty.

Psa. 8:1 (2).-“Who to set thy glory above the heavens”: who hast set.
The Targum and the Syriac have the Indicative (Num. 27:20).* [Note:
See the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible.]

Psa. 32:9.-“Not to understand”: {6., having no understanding.

Psa. 77:1 (2).-“Even unto God with my voice, and to hear me”: i.e.,
and He gave ear to me, or He will hear me; or, by Ellipsis, and He [will
condescend] to hear me.

Pro. 12:6.-“The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood”: i.e., lie
in wait.

Isa. 5:5.-Here, the Infinitive is correctly rendered by the Indicative
future: “I will take away, and break down,” etc.

Isa. 38:16.-“So wilt thou recover me, and to make me to live”: i.e., and
vivify me, or preserve my life.

Isa. 49:7.-“To him to despise in soul”: i.e., to him who is despised by
man.

Jer. 7:9.-“Will ye to steal, to murder,” etc. Some interpret the letter а
(He) as interogative, but others as intensive, Will ye steal, etc. (with
emphasis on the verbs).

Jer. 14:5.-“Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and to forsake it”: i.e.,
and forsook it, because there was no grass; or, the sense may be
supplied by Ellipsis, and [was obliged] to forsake it, etc.

Eze. 1:14.-“And the living creatures to run and to return”: i.e., ran and
returned.

Eze. 11:7.-“To bring you forth”: i.e., | will bring you forth. “I shall bring”
is actually the reading according to the Sevir, and indeed it is the
Textual reading in some MSS., as well as the Editio princeps of the
Hebrew Bible (Soncino, 1488), and the marginal reading of the first
edition of the Rabbinic Bible by Felix Pratensis (Venice, 1517), as may
be seen from the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Edition of the Hebrew Bible.
Hab. 2:15.-“To make him drunk”: /е., and makest him drunken also
(as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] ).
6. Infinitive for Imperative
Exo. 20:8.-“To remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy”: ie.,
remember thou. So Deu. 5:12.
Luk. 9:3.-“Neither to have two coats”: {6., neither have ye.

under Homeeoteleuton.

Other examples may be seen in Jos. 1:13. Job. 32:10 (11). Psa.

17:5; Psa. 22:8 (9). Isa. 32:11. Jer. 2:2.

Ill. Heterosis of the Tenses
As the Hebrew verb has only two principal tenses, the past and the
future, these two with the participles supply all the other tenses.
Hence, in the New Testament, where the thought and idiom are
Hebrew, though the tenses are Greek they consequently have all the
variety which these tenses have in Hebrew.

1. The Past for the Present
The Past not only serves to express what is finished or past, but what
is present: regarding it, and also the future, as actually done. The past
tense expresses what is either imperfect or perfect, or what is a gentle
imperative, or a fixed determination, or a continuation of the action or
state. The exact sense can be known only from the context.
Gen. 4:1.-“I have gotten a man from the Lord”: i.e., | have got, or,
possess.

Verse 9: “I have not known”: i.e. (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), | know not, or, |
do not know.

Gen. 23:11; Gen. 23:13.-“I have given thee the field”: {6., | give to
thee the field.
Gen. 32:10 (11).-“I have been unworthy of all the mercies”: i.e., | am
unworthy.

2Sa. 1:5.-“How hast thou known ({6., how dost thou know) that Saul
and Jonathan his son are dead?”

2Ki. 3:11.-“Here is Elisha, son of Shaphat, who hath poured ({6.,
poureth) water on the hands of Elijah.” Elijah’s servant is described by
part of his service (this is by the figure of Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:
Which see_] ).

Psa. 1:1.-“O the happiness of that one who hath not walked (i.e., doth
not (and never did) walk),” etc.

Psa. 14:1.-“The fool hath said ({6., sayeth) in his heart, There is no
God.” If this Psalm refers to Nabal (a foo/), we may render it: “Nabal
said” or “A fool sayeth.”

Psa. 25:2.-“My God, in thee | have trusted:” {6., do | trust. So Psa.
31:1 (2). Pro. 17:5; and in many other places: the sense being, “I have
trusted, and still do trust, in Thee.”

Psa. 31:6.-“Thou hast delivered (i.e., thou deliverest) me, О Jehovah.”
Isa. 9:2 (1).-“The People who walk in darkness have seen (i.e., see) а
great light.”
Joh. 1:4.-“In him was (i.e., is) life, and the life was (i.e., is) the light of
men.”

Verse 15: “This was (i.e., is) he of whom | spake.”
Joh. 3:16.-“God so loved (i.e., loveth) the world, that he gave ({6.,
giveth) his only begotten Son.”
Joh. 9:36.-“Who is he, Lord, that | shall have believed (i.e., may
believe) on him.”
Joh. 20:17.-“Hold me not, for | have not yet ascended”: i.e., | do not
yet ascend, or am not yet ascended.
Act. 12:14.-Rhoda “told Peter to be standing before the porch”: i.e.,
how Peter is standing.
Rom. 5:2.-“This grace wherein ye have stood”: i.e., and continue to
stand.
1Со. 1:10.-“In whom we have hoped (and continue to hope).”
Heb. 10:11.-“And every high priest stood (i.e., standeth) daily” (as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] ).
Jam. 1:24.-“He beheld himself, and has gone away”: ie., he
beholdeth himself, and goeth his way.
1Jn. 3:6.-“Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him”:
ie., seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.

Other examples may be seen in Joh. 5:45; Joh. 11:27; Joh. 16:27.
1Ti. 4:10; 1Ti. 5:5.

2. The Past for the Future

This is put when the speaker views the action as being as good as
done. This is very common in the Divine prophetic utterances: where,
though the sense is literally future, it is regarded and spoken of as
though it were already accomplished in the Divine purpose and
determination: the figure is to show the absolute certainty of the things
spoken of.
Gen. 45:9-10.-“Haste ye and go up to my father, then ye have said
(i.e., will say) to him ... and thou hast dwelt (i.e., wilt dwell) in the land
of Goshen.”

Exo. 17:4.-“They have stoned me”: i.e., they will stone me.

1Sa. 2:31.-“Lo, the days are coming, and | have cut off thine arm”: i.e.,
shall cut off, etc.

1Sa. 10:2.-“Thou hast found”: i.e., wilt find.

1Sa. 6:7-8.-“And ye have bound (i.e., will bind),” etc.

Job. 19:27.-“And mine eyes have beheld?” (i.e., will have seen).

Psa. 23:5.-“Thou hast anointed”: {.6., wilt anoint.

Psa. 107:42.-“And all iniquity hath shut ({6., will have shut) her
mouth.”

Pro. 1:22.-“The scorners have delighted (i.e., will delight) in their
scorning.”

Pro. 11:7; Pro. 11:21.-“The hope of the unjust men hath perished”:
ie., will perish: but just one’s seed hath escaped: {6., will escape.

Pro. 12:21.-“And the wicked have been (i-e., will be) full of evil.”
Jer. 21:9.-“Whosoever goeth forth and hath fallen unto the
Chaldeans”: i.e., shall fall, etc.

As we have said above, nearly all the prophecies are thus written.
See Isa. 11:1-16 : “And a rod hath come out of the stock of Jesse,”
and often through the chapter.

Joh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended up into the heaven”: i.e. ascend
up, or can ascend.

Joh. 4:38.-“Other men laboured, and ye have entered (i.e. shall enter,
or are entered) into their labours.”

Rom. 8:30.-The called are spoken of as already (in the Divine
purpose) in Christ, justified, yea, even glorified.

Eph. 2:6.-Believers are regarded as already raised from the dead and
seated in the heavenly places.

Heb. 2:7.-“Thou hast made (i.e., Thou wilt make) Him for a little while
less than the angels.” For this was a prophecy spoken of Christ long
before, in Psa. 8:1-9

Heb. 3:14.-“We have been made (i.e., we shall become) partakers of
Christ, if we hold,” etc.

Heb. 12:22.-“But ye have come (i.e., shall come) unto Mount Zion,”
etc.
3. The Aorist for the Past

The Aorist, or indefinite past tense, is used to denote an action
definitely past and completed some time ago.
Mat. 14:3.-“Now Herod, having laid hold of John, bound him”: i.e., had
bound him.
Joh. 18:24.-“New Annas sent him (i.e., had sent him) bound unto
Caiaphas.”

4. The Aorist for the Present
The Aorist is sometimes put for a past action or state continued up to
the present time.
Mat. 3:17.-“This is my beloved son, in whom | was (i.e., was and am)
well pleased.” So Mar. 1:11, and Luk. 3:22.
Mat. 23:2.-“The Scribes and Pharisees sat ({6., and continue to sit) in
Moses’ seat.”
Ματ. 16:19.-“Was taken up into heaven, and sat (/е., sat and
continues to sit) on the right hand of God.”
Luk. 1:47.-“My spirit rejoiced”: i.e., hath rejoiced and doth rejoice. A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
16411, “hath rejoiced.”
Luk. 15:16.-“And he was longing to have filled”: i.e., to fill.
Joh. 1:12.-“To them gave he authority to have become (i.e., to
become, or that they might be) sons of God.”
1Jn. 4:8.-“He that loveth not, knew not (i.e., knoweth not, or never
knew) God.”
Joh. 11:56.-“What think ye, that he will not have come (i.e., there is no
hope of his coming) to the feast?”
Joh. 15:6.-“Except anyone abide in me he was cast out (i.e., will be
cast out), and was ({:6., will be) burned.” See under Ellipsis.

5. The Present for the Past
Mat. 2:13.-“And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the
Lord appeareth ({6., appeared).”
Mar. 2:4.-“They are letting down the bed”: i.e., they did let down. See
also chaps, Mar. 3:19-20, Mar. 3:31 and Mar. 16:2.
Joh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended into heaven, but the Son of man
who is (i.e., who was) in heaven.” Note that the perfect of the first verb
is used for the future, as already observed above.
Act. 9:26.-“They were all afraid of him, not believing (or refusing to
believe) that he is ({6., was. So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) a disciple.”
Gal. 2:14.-“But when | saw that they do (i.e., did) not walk uprightly.”
Heb. 2:16.-“For not, indeed, of angels’ nature He taketh ({6., took)
hold, but of Abraham’s seed He taketh ({6., took) hold.”
Heb. 7:3.-“He remaineth (i.e., remained) a priest all his life.”
Heb. 7:8.-“One testified of that he liveth” (i.e., that he lived, viz., a
priest) all his life. See above.

6. The Present for the Future
This is put when the design is to show that some thing will certainly
come to pass, and is spoken of as though it were already present.
Mat. 2:4.-“Demanded of then where Christ should be (i.e., is to be)
born.”
Mat. 3:10.-“Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
down”: i.e., will be hewn down.

Mat. 17:11.-“Elias indeed cometh (i.e., will come) first.”
Mat. 26:29.-“Until the day when | drink ({6., shall be drinking) it with
you new,” etc.
Mar. 9:31.-“The Son of man is delivered ({6., will be delivered) unto
the hands of men.”

1Со. 15:12.-“How say some among you that there is (i.e., will or can
be) no resurrection of the dead?”
2Pe. 3:11.-“Seeing that all these things are (i.e., shall be) dissolved.”
2Pe. 3:12.-“And the elements are (i.e., shall be) melted.”

Other examples may be seen in Mat. 11:3. Joh. 7:27; Joh. 7:33-34;
Joh. 8:58; Joh. 10:17-18; Joh. 12:26; Joh. 12:34; Joh. 13:6; Joh.
13:27; Joh. 16:16. Act. 1:6. 1Co. 15:35; 1Co. 16:5. Rev. 11:5, etc., etc.
7. The Present for the Paulo post futurum*
[Note: This tense differs from the simple or perfect future by denoting
and referring to something which will soon be past.]

Mat. 26:24.-“The Son of man indeed goeth (i.e., will soon be gone, or
given over), as it is written of Him.”

So verse 45. Mar. 14:41. Luk. 22:22; Luk. 22:37. Joh. 13:3; Joh.
14:3; Joh. 14:18-19; Joh. 17:11, ete.
Luk. 22:19.-“Which is given (i.e., which will soon have been given) for
you.”

So also Mat. 26:28. Mar. 14:24. 1Co. 11:24.
Luk. 24:49.-“Behold, | send (i.e., | shall soon have sent) the promise
of my Father,” etc. So also Joh. 20:17.
2Ti. 4:6.-“For | already am being poured (or offered)”: i.e., | shall soon
have been offered up.

8. The Future for the Past

The future is used for the past when it is understood that the thing or
matter was future at the time of writing or speaking.
Exo. 15:5.-“The depths will cover ({.6., have covered and will continue
to cover) them.”

Jdg. 2:1.-“I shall make (i.e., | made) you to go up out of Egypt and
shall bring (i.e., have brought) you into the land which | sware unto
your fathers.” When the angel spake this it was past: when Jehovah
said it, it was future.

Jdg. 5:8.-“He (i.e., Israel) will choose (i.e., he chose) new Gods.” For
Deborah is speaking of the cause of the affliction which had fallen
upon the People: viz., idolatry.

Jdg. 21:25.-‘Each man will do (i.e., did) what was right in his own
eyes.”
2Sa. 3:33.-“And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Will Abner
die as a fool dieth?” (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , Died Abner, etc.).
2Sa. 12:3.-“She will (i.e., did) eat of his own meat, and will drink ({6.,
drank) of his own cup, and will lie (i.e., lay) in his bosom, and so she
became unto him as a daughter.”
Isa. 63:3.-“I shall tread ({6., | have trodden) ...” as in the rest of the
verse.

9. The Future for the Present
This is a case in which what was then future at the time of speaking,
remained, or remains, as a present fact. The present in this case is
often in the subjunctive or reflexive mood.
Gen. 2:10.-“And thence it will part (i.e., gets parted, or parts itself) and
becomes four heads.”
Num. 18:7.-“I shall give (i.e., | do give) your priest’s office unto you as
a service of gift”: {6., the gift at the time of speaking was future; but,
ministry remains an ever present gift.
Job. 3:20.-“Wherefore will light be given to him that is in misery?” (i.e.,
is light given).
Psa. 1:2.-“And in His Law he will (i.e., doth) meditate.” So Psa. 3:5 (6);
22:2 (3); 25:1; 31:5 (6). Hos. 1:2, etc.
Mat. 12:31.-“Every sin and blasphemy will be ({6., may be) forgiven to
men.
Luk. 6:7.-“Whether he will heal (i.e., whether he does heal) on the
sabbath day.” Here the Critical Texts actually read the present tense,
as in the next passage (Luk. 23:46).
Luk. 23:46.-“Father, into thy hands | shall commend (i.e., | commend)
my spirit.”
Rom. 3:30.-“Seeing it is one God which shall (i.e., doth) justify.”
10. The Future for the Imperative

The Future of the Indicative is by Hebrew idiom frequently used for the
Imperative. When this is the case, the Imperative is very forcible and
emphatic; not being so much a mere command as the assertion of a
fact which could hardly be otherwise. All the ten commandments are
in this form.

“Thou wilt not’ not merely “shalt not.”
Jdg. 5:21.-“O my soul, thou wilt tread down strength”: i.e., tread thou
down (not, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ “hast trodden down’); or, Μ.Μ. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] : “march on.”
So Psa. 5:11 (12).
1Со. 5:13.-“Ye will put away (i.e., put away) from among yourselves
that wicked person.
1Ti. 6:8.-“We shall be content”: {6., let us be content.
IV. Heterosis of Person and Number (Verbs)

In order to make what is said more emphatic, Hebrew idiom
sometimes changes the number and person of the verb. In most of
these cases the figure is correctly rendered in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , so
that we need only give a few examples which are there passed over.

1. The First Person for the Third
Ecc. 3:18.-“I said in my heart according to the reasoning of the sons
of men”: i.e., according to the reasoning of man, or human reasoning:
i.e., man says in his heart.

In Rom. 7:1-25, Paul, though speaking in the first person, is saying
what is true of all who share his experience: and not merely speaking
of his own case as being peculiar or different from others.

Rom. 10:18.-“But | say.” Who says it? David! But by the Holy Spirit
what David said is now repeated by Paul in the first person.

2. The Second Person for the Third
Isa. 1:29.-“They shall be ashamed for the oaks which ye (i.e., they)
have desired,” etc.

For they desired them, of course: yet the persons addressed were
equally guilty and are thus by the sudden change of persons charged
with the same sin.
Isa. 42:20.-“Seeing many things, but thou observest not”: (i.e., he
observes not) as in the rest of the verse.
Jer. 29:19.-“But ye (i.e., they) would not hear.”
Gal. 6:1.-“Ye that are spiritual restore such an one, in the spirit of
meekness, considering thyself (instead of yourselves).” This is in order
to emphasize the fact that those who are thus addressed stand each
in the same individual danger.

3. The Third person for the First or Second
Gen. 49:4.-“Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then
defiledst thou it: he went (/.e., thou wentest) up to my couch.”
Isa. 54:1.-Here the third person is rendered correctly in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] by
the second.
Lam. 3:1.-“I am the man, he hath (i.e., | have) seen affliction.”
Mic. 7:18.-Here we have “his” inheritance, after the address “like
thee.”
4. The Plural for the Singular
Gen. 29:27.-“Fulfil her week, and we ({6., I) will give thee this also for
thy service.”
Num. 22:6.-“Peradventure | shall prevail, that we (i.e., |) may smite
them.”
2Sa. 16:20.-“Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among
you What shall we (i.e., 1) do?”
Job. 18:2.-“How long will it be ere ye (i.e., thou) make an end of
words? mark, and afterwards we (i.e., |) will speak.”
Dan. 2:36.-“This is the dream; and we (i.e., |) will tell the interpretation
thereof.”
Mar. 4:30.-“Whereunto shall we (i.e., |) liken the kingdom of God?”
Joh. 3:11.-“We (i.e., |) speak that we (i.e., 1) know, and testify that we
(i.e., 1) have seen; and ye receive not our (/.e., my) witness.”
Joh. 21:24.-“And we (i.e., |) know that his testimony is true.”
Rom. 1:5.-“By whom we (i.e., |, Paul) have received grace and
apostleship.” (See also Hendiadys).
1Ti. 2:15.-“She will be saved through the child-bearing if they (i.e.,
and all her daughters) abide in faith,” etc.
5. The Singular for the Plural
Num. 32:25.-“Spake” is (sing) “he spake”: i.e., the tribe as composed
of the children of Gad,” etc. It is put for the plural, “they spake”; and it
should really be “they spake” (viz., the children of Gad and the
children of Reuben), according to the Sevir. This extra-official reading
is the Textual reading in several MSS.; in the Samaritan Text, in the
Targums of Jonathan and Onkelos, the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the
Vulgate. See the note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible. So 1Sa. 16:4 :
i.e., one particular elder spoke for all. But the sing. [Note: The Singular
Number.] is put for the plural: for here, again, according to the note in
Dr. Ginsburg’s Text, the verb should be in the plural. This is not only
the reading according to the Sevir, but it is in the Text of many MSS.,
the Editio princeps of the Prophets (Soncino, 1485-6), the first edition
of the Hebrew Bible (1488), the Targum, the LXX. [Note: The
Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] Syriac, and the Vulgate.
See also Est. 9:23. Job. 12:7. Psa. 73:7. Pro. 14:1; Pro. 14:9.
V. Heterosis of Degree
The Hebrew has no degrees of comparison in the Adjective: hence
other methods are adopted to express them.

In the New Testament, while the language is Greek, the thoughts
and idioms are Hebrew; so that the Hebrew methods of comparison
are frequently adopted; and thus we have, by the use of Enallage,
several examples of exchange in the expression of Degree. (See
under Idiom).

1. The Positive for the Comparative
Where the positive is used with the comparative particle ἤ (ee), than, it
implies that, though there may be in one sense a comparison, yet, in
another and true sense, there is really no comparison at all; for the
use of the positive declares that the one case is so, rather than the
other, which is not so.
Psa. 118:8-9.-“It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to put
confidence in man”: i.e., the one is good, the other is not; yea, it is
accursed (see Jer. 17:5; Jer. 17:7).
Mat. 12:7.-1 will have mercy, and not sacrifice’: i.e., rather than
sacrifice.
Mat. 18:8.-“It is good for thee”: {6., (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) it is better for
thee, etc. But the meaning is that the one condition is good, and not
the other. Hence it is expressed “rather than the other.”
Mar. 3:4.-“Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-days or to do evil?”:
i.eé., more lawful to do good than to do evil. The evil His enemies did
on the sabbath was in watching Him.
Luk. 18:14.- tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
than the other.”

Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] has translated it not as a comparative, but as
positive; supplying the word “rather,” which is quite correct. The
thought being that, while there must be a comparison between the two
men, the one was justified and the other was not.

The whole parable is concerning justification and not about prayer.
See verse 9.
Joh. 6:27.-“Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat
that endureth to eternal life”: i.e., labour more for the latter than for the
former, or rather than.
Joh. 15:22.-“If | had not come and spoken to them, they had not had
sin”: ᾖΘ., so much sin.
1Co. 3:7.-“So neither is the planter anything, nor the waterer; but God
that maketh grow’: i.e., they were nothing in comparison with God.

2. The Positive for the Superlative

1Sa. 17:14.-“And David was the small one (i.e., the smallest): and the
three great ones (i.e., the greater or greatest three) followed Saul.”
2Ch. 21:17.-“The small one (i.e., the smallest) of his sons.”
Jon. 3:5.-“From their great one (i.e., the greatest one among them) to
their small (i.e., smallest) one.”
Mat. 5:19.-“Whosoever therefore shall break one of these shortest
commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven, but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” See under
Synceceiosis.
Heb. 10:21.-“And having a great (i.e., highest) priest over the house of
God.”So Heb. 13:20.
3. The Comparative for the Positive

1Ti. 3:14.-“Hoping to come unto thee more quickly”: {Θ., soon; or, as
in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 16111], shortly.
2Ti. 1:18.-“And in how many things he ministered to me in Ephesus
thou knowest better’: {6., well; or (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), very well: i.e., to
well to need reminding of.

4. The Comparative for the Superlative
Mat. 13:32.-“Which indeed is less than (or least of) all the seeds
(which men sow in the fields).”

Mat. 18:1.-“Who then is greater in the kingdom of heaven”: or (as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] ), greatest.

Joh. 10:29.-“My Father, which gave them me, is greater than (i.e.,
greatest of) all.”

1Co. 13:13.-“But the greater (i.e., the greatest) of these is charity.”
1Co. 15:19.-"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all
men more ({6., most, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) miserable.”

5. The Superlative for the Comparative
Joh. 1:15.-“For he was first of me”: i.e., prior to me (A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] before
me). So the word first is used in Mar. 6:21; Luk. 19:47; Act. 25:2; Rev.
13:12; and perhaps Rev. 21:1 : “the former heaven and earth”; and
Rev. 20:6 : the former resurrection of the two foretold in the Old
Testament and in the Gospels. Not necessarily the special
resurrection of the Church of God revealed in 1Th. 4:16.
Joh. 15:18.-“If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me first of
you”: i.e., before you. So 1Co. 14:30. 1Ti. 5:12.
2Th. 2:3.-“Except there come the apostacy first”: {6., before it.
1Jn. 4:19.-“We love Him because He first loved us”: i.e., before we
loved Him.

VI. Heterosis of Number
1. The Singular for the Plural
Gen. 3:8.-“Hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God
amongst the tree (i.e., trees) of the garden”; or, perhaps, tree in the
sense of tree-growth or “a wood” as we speak of a collection of trees.
Gen. 49:6.-“In their anger they slew a man (i.e., men) and in their self-
will they houghed an ox (i.e., oxen).”
Exo. 14:17.-Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has taken the singular “chariot” as
though put for the plural. But it is a question whether it be so in this
case, owing to the alternate structure.
а Pharaoh.
b — Нб host.
а Pharaoh's chariot.
Ь — His horsemen.
Exo. 15:1; Exo. 15:21.-“The horse and his rider”: i.e., horses and their
riders.”
Exo. 23:28.-“I shall send the hornet before thee”: {6., hornets (without
the article).
Lev. 11:2.-“This is the beast which ye shall eat”: ᾖ6., these are the
beasts, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.]

2Co. 11:26.-“Dangers in the city (i.e., cities, or city-dangers), dangers
in the wilderness ({.6., wildernesses, or wilderness-dangers).”

1Со. 6:5.-“One who shall be able to judge between his brother”: {6.,
his brethren.

See also Num. 21:7; Num. 21:31. Deu. 20:19. 2Sa. 19:41 (42).
Pro. 17:22; Hos. 5:6. Jon. 2:3 (4), etc. And in New Testament, Rev.
21:21, “street” for streets. Also often “demon” and “wicked ones”
means all the demons and evil spirits. See Joh. 8:44, and Eph. 6:16.

In Pronouns the singular is frequently put for the plural. See Deu.
21:10. Jos. 2:4. 2Ki. 3:3. Psa. 35:8. Php. 3:20.

2. The Plural for the Singular
This is so put when great excellence or magnitude is denoted.

Our attention is thus called to the importance of the thing or matter
concerning which the statement is made.
Gen. 4:10.-“Bloods”: i.e., much blood.
Lev. 19:24.-“It shall be holy to praise the Lord withal.” Heb. (margin), it
shall be “holiness of praises to the Lord”: i.e., the fruit of a young tree
was not to be eaten for three years, but in the fourth year it was to be
counted as holy to the great praise and glory of Jehovah. See under
Prosopopesia.

Gen. 19:11.-“And they smote the men that were at the door of the
house with the blindnesses”: i.e., with intense blindness (as in 2Ki.
6:18, the only occurrences of this word).

2Sa. 3:28.-“Bloods”: /е., much blood.

1Ch. 28:3.-“Bloods”: i.e., much blood.

Psa. 22:3 (4).-“O Thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel”: i.e., the
loud or perfect praise.
Psa. 28:8.-“The Lord is their strength, and he is the strength of
salvations”: {6., great saving strength or strength of great and mighty
salvation. The margin has “his strength,” but 6il stands for 6Nil
written defective for plene, as is shown and preserved in some ancient
versions and noted in R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
margin.* [Note: See Dr. Ginsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible.] The
meaning thus is:-

“Jehovah is the strength of his people,

And He is the strength of great salvation of His anointed.”
Psa. 42:5 (6), 11 (12); 43:5.-“l shall yet praise him for the helps or
healths”: {6., the wonderful help, great deliverance, or great salvation.
Psa. 45:15 (16).-“With gladnesses and rejoicing shall they be
brought”: i.e., with great gladness and rejoicing.
Psa. 47:6 (7).-“Praises”: i.e., great or loudest praise.
Psa. 49:3 (4).-“My mouth shall speak wise things”: {6., great wisdom.
Psa. 51:17 (19).-“The sacrifices of God”: the great sacrifice of God is
a broken spirit.
Psa. 89:1 (2).-“I will sing of the mercies”: i.e., the great and wondrous
mercy. So often in N.T., Rom. 12:1. 2Co. 1:3.

Psa. 90:10.-“And if by reason of strengths (or excellencies)”: i.e., of
great strength.

Psa. 139:14.-‘I will confess thee, because that (with) wonders (i.e.,
with great wonder) | have been distinguished, and wonderful are thy
works.”

Psa. 144:7.-“Send thine hands from above; rid me and deliver me”:
i.e., send thy gracious protection and great delivering power.

The singular is actually the Textual reading, not only in some
Manuscripts, but in the Editio princeps of the Hagiographa (Naples,
1486-7), the Targum, the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.).] , the Syriac, and the Vulgate. See Dr. Ginsburg’s note on this
passage in his edition of the Hebrew Bible.

See under Anthropopatheia.

Ecc. 5:6 (7).-“Vanities”: i.e., great vanity.

Isa. 26:2.-“Which keepeth truths”: i.e., the great and important truth of
God.

Isa. 58:11.-“In droughts”: /.e., in great drought.
Jer. 22:21.-“| spake unto thee in thy prosperities (i.e., in thy great
prosperity), but thou saidst, | will not hear.”

Lam. 1:9.-“Wonders”: i.e., a great wonder.

Lam. 3:22.-‘It is of the Lord’s mercies”: {6., great mercy.

Eze. 22:2.-“The city of the bloods”: i.e., the city where so much blood
has been shed.

Eze. 25:17.-“Vengeances”: i.e., great or terrible vengeance. See A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] margin and Psa. 94:1.

Eze. 28:10.-“Deaths”: i.e., the awful death.

Dan. 2:18.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.

Mat. 26:65.-“Then the High Priest rent his clothes”: i.e., his great robe
of office.

Joh. 1:13.-“Not of bloods”: {6., not of the best or purest blood; or not
of the very best of human parents.

Act. 1:7.-“Times or seasons”: i.e., the great and important time and
season. So 1Th. 5:1. 1Ti. 6:15. Tit. 1:3.

Rom. 12:1.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.
1Со. 15:29.-It has been suggested that in this passage we have the
plural for the singular. “What shall they do which are baptized for the
dead?” (plural) /е., for Christ, who was put to death.

But see this passage under Ellipsis (page 41).
2Co. 1:3.-“Mercies”: i.e., great mercy.
Heb. 9:12.-“Into the holies”: /.e., the most holy place.
Heb. 9:23.-“With better sacrifices than these”: ie., one better and
greater sacrifice; for Christ offered only one sacrifice.
Heb. 10:28.-“Without mercies”: i.e., without the least mercy.
Jam. 1:17.-“Father of lights”: i.e., true light. Hence, the Father who is
the source of all true light (being the genitive of origin).
1Ре. 5:3.-“Not as being lords over God's heritages”: i.e., great
heritage. The word “God” is repeated, by Ellipsis, from verse 2, and
presents the same truth as Act. 20:28.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is a gloss and not a
translation:-“Neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you.” The
great point is that God’s People are His great inheritance; and that no
man has a right to assume lordship or headship over it. It is Peter who
says this by the Holy Spirit. The Greek is τῶν κλήρων (ίφη kleerdbn),
the word from which we have the term “clergy.” So that man’s thought
is just the opposite of God’s. Man’s thought is that the people are not
to lord it over the clergy; but that the clergy are to lord it over them.
This is just the opposite of what is taught us and impressed upon us
by the use of this figure in 1Pe. 5:3, where the truth is that the clergy
are not to lord it over the laity.
2Pe. 3:11.-“In holy conversations and godlinesses”: i.e., holy, weighty,
and solemn conduct and piety.

Certain words are generally plural: e.g., αἰῶνες (aiqones), ages.
This may be to mark the fact that eternity is made up of successive
ages: the singular referring either to one such age; or including all, as
a whole. Hence we have εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα (eis ton афпа), unto the age or
for ever (Mat. 21:19. Joh. 6:51; Joh. 6:58. 1Pe. 1:25 from Isa. 40:8,
etc.). And εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας (eis tous αἰφπας), unto the ages (Luk. 1:33.
Rom. 1:25; Rom. 9:5. Heb. 13:8, etc.).

OUpavoi (ouranoi), heavens, is generally plural; a usage arising
from the Hebrew idiom where the word is dual. It is always plural in
the phrase “kingdom of heaven,” where “heaven” is used by
Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) for God. The Hebrew idiom is
sometimes rendered thus, literally, and sometimes idiomatically,
“kingdom of God.”

See under Idiom.

3. Sometimes the plural is put for an indefinite number, or for one
of many

In this latter case the word “one” is to be supplied by Ellipsis.

Gen. 8:4.-“The mountains”: i.e., one of the mountains, or the great

mountain.

Gen. 19:29.-“The cities in which Lot dwelt”: {.6., in one of which cities.

Jdg. 12:7.-Here the words “one of’ are supplied in italics.

Neh. 3:8.-“Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths”: i.e., of one
of the goldsmiths.
Job. 21:32.-“Yet shall he (the wicked) be brought to the graves”: i.e.,
to one of the graves: i.e., his grave.
Mat. 2:20.-“They are dead who seek,” etc.: only Herod is meant (see
Exo. 4:19).
Mat. 9:8.-“Which gave such power to men (pl. [Note: The Plural
Number,] ).” Only one is meant, viz., Christ.

Transition or Change from the Singular to the Plural.

In these cases, it is not so much that one number or person is
exchanged for another as that there is a sudden change from one to
the other, calling our attention to the truth taught by this change. See
under Anacoluthon.

Exo. 10:2.-“And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son ... that ye
may know how that | am the Lord.”

Psa. 14:1.-“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ They are
corrupt,” etc.

Isa. 2:20.-“In that day shall a man cast his idols ... which they have
made each one for himself to worship.”

Gal. 4:6-8.-“Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of His
Son into your hearts ... Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a
son ... Howbeit, then, when ye knew not God,” etc.
Gal. 6:1.-“Ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of
meekness; considering thyself.”
See also 1Th. 5:1-10. 1Ti. 2:15. Rev. 1:3, etc.
Vil. Heterosis of Gender
As the Hebrew (like French) has no neuter gender, sometimes the
masculine is used, and sometimes the feminine.

And this is seen in the Greek of the New Testament,
notwithstanding that the Greek has the neuter gender. There are,
however, other exchanges of gender besides this.

1. The Masculine for the Feminine
Act. 9:37.-“Whom when they had washed.” Here, though (in the
Greek) the masculine “they” is put, women are meant.
Heb. 9:16-17.-“The testator,” 6 διαθέµενος (ho diatheminos): i.e., the
covenant-maker, is masculine; but the word for sacrifice, to which it
refers, is feminine: yet the masculine is used, because the sacrifice
was Christ Himself; otherwise it would have been feminine to agree
with sacrifice (ἡ θύσια, hee thusia). Thus, though the Greek word is
feminine, the Heb. éag is masculine, and © διαθέµινος agrees with
the Heb. thought, rather than with the Greek word. (See pages 69 and
493).

2. The Masculine for the Neuter
Gen. 2:18.-“He is not good”: i.e., it is not a good thing for him (man) to
be alone. See also Psa. 119:65. Isa. 5:20; Isa. 7:15.
Joh. 16:13.-“When He-the Spirit of truth-is come, He will guide you
into all truth, for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He
shall hear that shall He speak, and He will show you things to come.”
Here, though the word “Spirit” is neuter, the pronouns are masculine,
and this is so put in order to show and impress upon us that the Holy
Spirit is a Person.
3. The Feminine for the Neuter

Gen. 50:20.-“Ye thought evil (fem.) against me, but God meant it unto
good (fem.).” While the masc. mA is generally used for moral evil, its
feminine ma is used for the consequence of that-viz., physical evil.
So here, the feminine denotes mischief, hurt: “Ye meant me harm; but
God meant it (masc.) for good”: i.e., meant to turn it to good. So also
Job. 5:9. Psa. 12:3; Psa. 27:4.

Also for the use of pronouns (see Gen. 15:6; Gen. 43:32. Exo.
10:11. Num. 23:23. Psa. 118:23. Mat. 21:42. Mar. 12:11.
4. The Neuter for the Masculine or Feminine
Mat. 1:20.-“For that (neut.) which is conceived (or begotten) in her.”
So Luk. 1:35 : “that holy thing.”
Mat. 18:11.-“For the Son of Man is come to save that (neut.) which
was lost”: i.e., lost sinners, of both sexes.
Joh. 1:46 (47).-“Can there any good thing (neut.) come out of
Nazareth?” The words were spoken with reference to Christ.
Joh. 3:6.-“That (neut.) which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
(neut.) which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” The neuter is used to agree
with the word “thing,” though person is meant: because that which is
born of the flesh or spirit is rather the fleshly or spiritual nature, than
the man as an individual: but also, because it includes men and
women.
Heb. 7:7.-“And without all contradiction the less (neut.) is blessed of
the better.”

See also Luk. 16:15. Joh. 6:39 (compare verse 40). 1Co. 1:27-28.
1Jn. 1:1.-“That which was from the beginning,” etc.: ᾖΘ., Him who
was. Compare Joh. 1:1; Joh. 1:14.
1Jn. 5:4.-“For whatsoever (neut.) is begotten of God.” That this refers
to persons is clear from verses 1-5: but it is put neuter both on
account of the spiritual or new nature which is referred to (spirit being
neuter), as well as from the fact that both men and women are
included.

1Jn. 5:8.-“There are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit (neut.),
and the water (neut.), and the blood (neut.), and these (masc.) three
are one.” Because persons are meant, the pronoun is masculine,
though the other words are neuter.
