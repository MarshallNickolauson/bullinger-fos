Deu. 22:1.-“Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray,
and hide thyself from them.”

Here, the negative is put with “see” instead of with “hide,” in order
to emphasize the command, which would otherwise tamely read:-“If
thou shalt see ... thou shalt not hide,” etc. See under Metonymy.

Mic. 6:10.-“Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of
the wicked?” In the Hebrew, the verse begins with the adverb: “Still
are there in the house of the wicked man treasures of wickedness?”
Act. 7:48.-In the English, the negative is joined with the verb, with
which it is to be read: but in the Greek, the negative is put at the
beginning of the clause, and the verb at the end, which greatly
intensifies the force of the word “not.”

“But not the Most High in hand-made temples dwelleth.”
