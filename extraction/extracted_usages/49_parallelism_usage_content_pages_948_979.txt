|. Simple
1. Synonymous or Gradational
This is when the lines are parallel in thought, and in the use of
synonymous words.
The oldest example, and the first in the Bible, is in
Gen. 4:23-24.-In these oldest human poetic lines Lamech celebrates
the invention of weapons of war: and it is significant that this should be
the first subject of poetry! Lamech’s son was “an instructor of every
artificer in brass and iron,” and the injury of others was the earliest
application of the art.

Lamech is so elated with that which would give him power among
men that he at once breaks out in eulogy; and boasts that if any one
injures him, he would outdo even Jehovah in His punishment of those
who should injure Cain.

There are three pairs of lines, and the synonymous words will be
at once seen, as we have exhibited them:-

“Adah and Zillah hearken to my voice;
Ye wives of Lamech listen to my speech.
For | can slay a man, if he injures me,
And a young man, if he hurts me.

If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold,
Truly Lamech [shall be avenged]* [Note: See under
Ellipsis.] seventy-seven-fold.”
Luk. 1:46-47.-
“My soul doth magnify the Lord,
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.”
Psa. 1:1.-“Blessed is the man
that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners,
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.”
Here, we have three series of gradation:-
Walketh,
standeth,
sitteth,
Counsel,
way,
seat.
Ungodly,
sinners,
scornful.

These gradations point us to the fact that there is a mine of truth
contained in the verse, on which a volume might be written.

The tenses also have their lessons for us too, for they imply “that
never did walk ... stand ... sit’: and so help to teach us that in this first
Psalm David speaketh “concerning”: i.e., “with an ultimate reference
to” (εἰς, eis), “Christ” (See Act. 2:25). In fact, this first Psalm speaks of
Christ as the one perfect Man; while the second speaks of Him as the
one perfect King: (“the model Shepherd,” He Himself says He is: ©
ποιμὴν © καλός (Πο poimeen ho kalos), not simply © καλὸς ποιµήν (Πο
kalos poimeen): and then twice over at least (see Joh. 10:11; Joh.
14:1-31); and so, too, is He the “model” Man and the “model” King.
2. Antithetic, or Opposite
This is when the words are contrasted in the two or more lines, being
opposed in sense the one to the other.
Pro. 10:1.-
“A wise son maketh a glad father;
But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother”
Pro. 27:6.-
“Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy”
3. Synthetic, or Constructive
This is where the parallelism consists only in the similar form of
construction:-
Psa. 19:7-9.-
“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether”
Here, there is neither gradation nor opposition of words in the
several lines; which are independent, and depend for their parallelism
on their construction.
In all the above cases the lines are simply parallel, and are chiefly
in pairs.
When the parallelism appears in four or more lines, then it may be
called
Il. Complex
1. Alternate
This is when the lines are placed alternately. In this case, the first and
third lines, and the second and fourth lines, may, as a rule, be read
continuously, while the intervening line is thus placed in a parenthesis.
These alternate lines may be either synonymous or antithetic.
Gen. 19:25.-
а “The cities (and He overthrew)
Ь — The plain (and all the plain),
а — The inhabitants of the cities,
Ь — The produce of the plain.”
Deu. 32:21.-
a “They have moved me to jealousy
ЬБ — with that which is not God:
а — They have provoked me to anger
b_ with their vanities:
ο And! will move them to jealousy
@ — with those which are not a people:
ο | will provoke them to anger
а with a foolish nation.”
Deu. 32:42.-Here a and a are continuous, and likewise b and b. They
must be so read, thus dispensing with the italics. The line b we give
from the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
а “I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
b — апа my sword shall devour much flesh;
а with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
Ь from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”
Here a and a relate to the arrows, while b and b refer to the sword.
1Ch. 21:22.-
а — Request. “Grant me the place of this threshingfloor.”
Ь Design. “That I may build an altar therein unto the Lord.”
а Request. “Thou shalt grant it me for the full price.”
Ь Design. “That the plague may be stayed from the people.”
Here a and a are continuous, likewise b and b. We must read on
from Ь to b, placing a in a parenthesis. This shows that the plague was
stayed, not because David paid the full price for the place, but
because of the atoning sacrifice which he offered.
Est. 8:5.
а — The king. “If it please the king.”
Ь Esther’s personal influence. “And if 1 have found favour.”
а — The king. “And the thing seem right before the king.”
b Esther’s personal influence. “And | be pleasing in his
eyes.”
Pro. 18:24, -The parallel here is lost owing to an obscurity in the
Hebrew. The Massorah records that the word ru (osh) (which has
been taken by translators as another spelling of réu (eesh), а man)
is put three times* [Note: The other two passages are 2Sa. 14:19
(where the sense is unaffected, “If there is any that turn” meaning
“none can turn”), and Mic. 6:10, where the reading called Sevir which
is equal in authority to the Keri, is boldly adopted into the Text by both
the A.V. and the R.V. “Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the
house of the wicked,” etc.] for éu (yesh), there is.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] avoids the italics of
the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] which are put in to make some sort of sense owing to
the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] having taken 6A UrIAN trom the wrong root (ha, to
feed), instead of ma, to break). So that instead of meaning to make
friends, it means (as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] )
to be broken in pieces. Hence, to ruin oneself.

The point and the parallel, therefore, lies in the plural “friends”: i.e.,
or many friends in contrast with the faithfulness of the one “friend”:-

а “There are “friends

b — Ю our own detriment:
а But there is a friend
Ь that sticketh closer than a brother.”
See under Paronomasia.
Pro. 24:19-20.
а “Fret not thyself because of evil men,
b neither be thou envious at the wicked;
а For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
Ь The candle of the wicked shall be put out.”
Isa. 1:29-30.-
a “For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have
desired,
Ь — And ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
chosen.
а Forye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth,
Ь And asa garden that hath no water.”
Isa. 9:10.-
а “The bricks are fallen down,
b but we will build with hewn stones:
а — The sycomores are cut down,
Ь — Виё we will change them into cedars.”
Isa. 14:26-27.-
а “This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth:
b And this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the
nations,
а For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
it?
Ь — And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?”
Isa. 17:7-8.-
а “At that day shall a man look to his Maker,
Ь — апа his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel,
а And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
Ь neither shall respect that which his fingers have made:”
Isa. 18:6.-
а Fowls. “They shall be left, etc.”
Ь Beasts. “And to the beasts, etc.”
а Fowls. “And the fowls, etc.”
Ь Beasts. “And all the beasts, etc.”
Isa. 31:3.-
а “The Egyptians are men,
Ь — апа not God:
а And their horses flesh,
Ь — апа not spirit.”
See under Pleonasm.
Isa. 34:6.-Here the first and third lines are continuous, as are also the
second and fourth lines.
а “The sword of the Lord is filled with blood,
Ь — itis made fat with fatness,
а and with the blood of lambs and goats,
Ь — with the fat of the kidneys of rams.”
Isa. 51:20 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).-Here a and a,
and b and b must be read together in order to catch the sense.
а “Thy sons have fainted,
Ь they lie [[6., are cast down]
а at the top of all the streets,
Ь — а5 an antelope in a net.”
Isa. 59:5-6.-
а “They hatch cockatrice’ eggs,
Ь — ап{ weave the spide’s web;
а — Не that eateth of their eggs dieth ..
Ь — Their webs shall not become garments.”
Isa. 61:4.-
а “And they shall build the old wastes,
Ь ἍΤΠΘΥ shall raise up the former desolations,
а and they shall repair the waste cities,
Ь — The desolations of many generations.”
See also under Epanodos, Antimetabole, and Chiasmos.
2. Repeated Alternation
This is not confined to two alternate lines repeated, making four lines
in all, as in the preceding examples; but in the repetition of the two
parallel subjects in several lines.
Isa. 65:21-22.-
а1 “And they shall build houses,
b1 and inhabit them;
а2 And they shall plant vineyards,
b2 and eat the fruit of them.
a3 They shall not build,
b3 and another inhabit;
a4 They shall not plant,
b4 and another eat.”
Or, these may be arranged in four longer alternate lines, thus:-
Positive.
а Houses (they shall build),
Ь Vineyards (they shall plant).
Negative.
а — Houses (they shall not build),
Ь — Vineyards (they shall not plant).
Where the first two lines are positive and the last negative.
1Jn. 2:15-16.-
a1 “If any man love the world,
b1 the love of the Father is not in him,
a2 For all that is in the world.
b2 is not of the Father,
83 but is of the world.”
3. Extended Alternation
The Scriptures abound with other illustrations of the arrangement of
alternate parallel lines.
But these alternate lines may consist not merely of two pairs, or of
four lines; or, of repeated alternations: the alternation may be
extended. That is to say, the alternation may be extended so as to
consist of three or more lines.
Jdg. 10:17.-
а “Then the children of Ammon
Ь — меге gathered together,
с — апа encamped in Gilead.
а And the children of Israel
b assembled themselves together,
ο. and encamped in Mizpeh.”
Mat. 6:19-20.-
а “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
Ь — where moth and rust doth corrupt,
с — апа where thieves break through and steal:
a But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
Ь — where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
с — апа where thieves do not break through nor steal.”
See under Epibole.
4. Introverted Parallelisms
This is when the parallel lines are so placed that if there be six lines,
the first corresponds with the sixth, the second with the fifth, and the
third with the fourth.
When this Introversion consists only of words and of the same
words, it is called Epanodos (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
When Propositions are introverted, it is called Antimetabole (q.v.
[Note: Which 5εε.]).
When Subjects are introverted, it is called Chiasmus (see under
Correspondence).
Gen. 3:19.-
а End. “Till thou return unto the ground.”
b Origin. “For out of it was thou taken.”
Ь Origin. “For dust thou art.”
а End. “And unto dust shalt thou return.”
Exo. 9:31.-
а “And the flax
b — апа the barley was smitten:
Ь — For the barley was in the ear,
а and the flax was bolled.”
Num. 15:35-36.-
а “And the Lord said unto Moses,
Ь The man shall be surely put to death:
ο they shall stone him with stones,
4 — а! the congregation without the camp.
а And they brought him forth, all the congregation
without the camp,
с — апа stoned him with stones,
Ь — апа he died;
а — as the Lord commanded Moses.”
Deu. 32:16.-
а “They provoked Him to jealousy
Ь — with strange gods:
Ь — with abominations
а provoked they Him to anger.”
This shows that when “abominations” are spoken of, idols are
meant.
188. 1:2.-
а “The name of the one was Hannah,
b — апа the name of the other was Peninnah:
Ь And Peninnah had children,
а but Hannah had no children.”
2Sa. 3:1.-
а — “Now there was long war between the house of Saul
b — апа the house of David:
Ь but [the house ой David waxed stronger and stronger,
а — And the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.”
1ΚΙ. 16:22.-
а “But the people that followed Omri prevailed
b against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath:
Ь — So Tibni died,
а and Omri reigned.”
2Ch. 32:7-8.-
a Our resource. “There be more with us.”
Ь — Нб resource. “Than with him.”
Ь His resource. “With him is an arm of flesh.”
a Our resource. “But with us is the Lord our God.”
Psa. 76:1.-
а “In Judah
Ь — & God known:
Ь — His name is great
а In Israel.”
This shows how “the Name” of God stands, and is put for God
Himself. See under Metonomy.
Psa. 115:4-8.-
а 4-. The idols.
Ь — -4. Their fabrication.
ο 5-. Mouth without speech (singular in Heb.).
@ -5. Eyes without sight (plural).
е — 6-. Ears without hearing (pl. [Note: |. The Plural
Number.] )
# — -6. Nose without smell (sing. [Note: ing. The
Singular Number.] )
e 7-. Hands without handling (pl. [Note: |. The
Plural Number.] )
а -7. Feet without walking (pl. [Note: |. The Plural
Number.] )
с -7. Throat without voice (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular
Number] )
Ь — 8-. The fabricators.
а -8. The idolators.
Psa. 135:15-18.-
а — The idols of the heathen.
Ь — Their fabrication.
с Mouths without speech.
@ Eyes without sight.
а Ears without hearing.
с Mouths without breath.
Ь — The fabricators.
а The idolatrous heathen.
Pro. 1:26-27.-
а — “lL also will laugh at your destruction,
b | will mock when your fear cometh;
Ь When your fear cometh as desolation,
а and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind.”
Pro. 3:16.-
а — Blessings. “Length of days.”
Ь Hand. “Is in her right hand.”
Ь Hand. “And in her left hand.”
а Blessings. “Riches and honour.”
Isa. 5:7.-
а “For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts
Ь — is the house of Israel,
Ь — апа the men of Judah
а His pleasant plant.”
Isa. 6:10.-
а “Make the heart of this people fat,
Ь — апа make their ears heavy,
ο — апа shut their eyes;
ο. lest they see with their eyes,
Ь — апа hear with their ears,
а and understand with their heart.”
See under Polyptoton, page 299.
Isa. 11:4.-
а — “Не shall smite the oppressor,
Ь with the rod of his mouth,
Ь — апа with the breath of his lips
а Shall He slay the wicked.”
The current Hebrew Text reads Πό (eretz), the earth, but this is
manifestly a scribal error for ἤἴό (aritz), the oppressor. The Aleph (ὢ
being similar in sound with Ayin (A) was easily exchanged by
transcribers. And the Parallelism shows beyond doubt that this is the
case here.* [Note: This is from the ms. notes for the second edition of
Dr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible.]

Isa. 50:1.-
а “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, whom | have
put away?
bor which of my creditors is it to whom | have sold you?
Ь Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves,

а — And for your transgressions is your mother put away.”

Isa. 51:8-9.-

а “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
Ь Neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord,
Ь — For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so aremy

ways higher than your ways,

а and my thoughts than your thoughts.”

Here the whole paragraph is introverted. In a and a we have
“thoughts,” in b and b we have “ways.” But the pronouns in a and a
are alternate as to the “thoughts”:-

ο ΜΥ thoughts.

4 Your thoughts.
ο ΜΥ thoughts.
а Your thoughts.
While they are introverted in b and b as to the “ways”:-
е Your ways.
f My ways.
# Myways.
е Your ways.
Further we may note that a and b are negative; and b and a are
positive.
Isa. 60:1-3.-
а “Arise,
Ь Shine; for thy light is come,
с — апа the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
@ — For behold darkness shall cover the earth,
@ and gross darkness the people:
ο but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall
be seen upon thee.
Ь And the Gentiles shall come to thy light,
а and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”
All these structures may be described, as well as set forth in full.
Thus:-
а The rising of Israel. (“Rising up.”)
Ь The Light received.
ο The glory of the Lord.
@ The darkness of the earth.
а The darkness of the peoples.
с The glory of the Lord.
Ь — The Light reflected.
а -The rising of Israel. (Dawning: “Thy sunrise.”)
Dan. 5:19.-
а Severity (“Whom he would he slew’).
Ь Favour (“and whom he would he kept alive”).
Ь — Favour (“and whom he would he set up”).
а Severity (“and whom he would he put down’).
Mat. 6:24.-
а “ΝΟ man can serve two masters:
Ь — Еог either he will hate the one
ο and love the other:
ο. ο/ else he will hold to the one
Ь — ап{ despise the other.
а Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”
Mat. 7:6.-
а “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,

Ь neither cast ye your pearls before swine,
Ь lest they trample them under their feet,

а and turn again and rend you.”

Here, the introversion shows that it is the swine who tread the
pearls under foot, and the dogs which rend.

Rom. 11:21-23.-
а “If God spared not the natural branches,
b take heed lest He also spare not thee.
с Behold therefore the goodness
@ — ап{ severity of God:
@ onthem which fell, severity;
с but toward thee, goodness, ...
Ь — otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

a_ And they also (the natural branches), if they abide not still in

unbelief, shall be graffed in.”

This passage occurs in the Dispensational part of the Epistle to the
Romans (9-11). See under Correspondence. Hence, it relates to Jew
and Gentile as such; and consequently it is not to be interpreted of the
Church, the standing of which is so clearly set forth in chapter 8. So
that the statement in line Ь can have no reference to those who are in
Christ, for whom there is no condemnation and no separation.
1Co. 1:24-25.-
а Power. “Christ the power of God.”
Ь Wisdom. “And the wisdom of God.”
Ь Wisdom. “Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
men.”
а Power. “And the weakness of God is stronger than men.”
2Co. 1:3.-
а Deity. “Blessed be God.”
Ь Paternity. “Even the Father.”
Ь — Paternity. “The Father of mercies.”
а Deity. “And the God of all comfort.”
2Co. 8:14.-
а — Equality. “By an equality.”
Ь Liberality. “That now ... at this time your abundance may
be a supply for their want.”
b Liberality. “That their abundance also may be a supply for
your want.
а Equality. “That there may be ... equality.”
Gal. 2:7-8.-
a Paul's commission. “When they saw that the Gospel of the
uncircumcision was committed unto me.”
b__Peter’s. “As the Gospel of circumcision was unto Peter.”
b Peter’s. “For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision.”
а Paul’s commission. “The same was mighty in me toward the
Gentiles.”
