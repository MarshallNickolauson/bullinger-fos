2Sa. 16:9.-“Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why
should this dead dog curse thy lord, the king? let me go over, | pray
thee, and take off his head.”

A dog does not curse; still less does a “dead dog”: but the vivid
figure is eloquent, and stands for a whole paragraph which would be
required to express literally all that the figure implies.
