Num. 24:5.-“How goodly thy tents, О Jacob.”
Mat. 8:10.-“When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
followed, Verily | say unto you, | have not found so great faith, no, not
in Israel.”

Rom. 11:33.-“O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out!”

This is a proper Ecphonesis, except that it expresses wonder and
astonishment, so that it is combined with Thaumasmos.

Gal. 1:6.-“I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Christ unto another (ἕτερον (heteron), different)
Gospel.”

A simple statement would have expressed the fact, “Ye are soon
removed,” etc., but thus solemnly is our attention called to the whole
subject-matter of the epistle.

Epistles).
