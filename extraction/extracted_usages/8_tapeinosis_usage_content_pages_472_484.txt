1. Positively
ONE (231) in the plural (in Heb.) is used for a few or some:-
Gen. 27:44.-“Tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn
away.”

We learn from 29:20 that the love which he bore to Rachel is
emphasized by speaking of the seven years in which he served for her
as “a few days.”

SOME (tic) in plural (in Greek) is used for the greater number:-
Rom. 3:3.-“For what if some did not believe?” Our attention is by this
at once pointed to the fact that it was in reality the very opposite. It
was only “some” who believed, while the nation as a whole did not
believe.
1Ti. 4:1.-“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits
(πνεύµασιν πλάνοις, wandering or deceiving spirits or angels), and
teachings of demons:” i.e., a vast number of people will be deceived
by evil angels and demons in these last days.

Act. 5:36.-“Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody” (τινα) i.e.,
some great person; as is explained in Act. 8:9.

Gal. 2:6.-“But of these who seemed to be somewhat (1!).” They
seemed to be something, really they were nothing (6:3).
SICK, for those who were dead in sins:
Rom. 5:6.-“For when we were yet without strength” (ἀσθενῶν,
asthen?n, sick). We were really “dead in sin,” but are spoken of as
infirm, because called “ungodly,” “sinners” (verses 6-8), “enemies”
(verse 10).

REBUKE, for the great punishment of excommunication.
20ο. 2:6.-“Sufficient to such a man is this punishment” (ἐπιτιμία,
epitimia), rebuke. See further under /diom

2. Negatively
When the emphasis is made by the use of the negative in order to
express the positive in a very high degree, this is the figure of
Antenantiosis (see above).

When we say of a man that “he is no fool,” we mean that he is very
wise; or when we say of a thing, “it is not a hundred miles from here,”
we mean that it is quite close at hand. We thus emphasize that which
we seem to lessen: e.g., when it is written, “I praise you not,” it means
| greatly blame you!

Exo. 20:7.-“The Lord will not hold him guiltless:” i.e., He will hold him
guilty of breaking the whole law.

Lev. 10:1.-They “offered strange fire before the Lord, which he had
commanded them not.” Here, the figure is translated. The Heb. is
literally, “which the Lord had not commanded them,” j.e., He had very
solemnly prohibited it; see Exo. 30:9.

Num. 21:23.-“And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his
border.” Heb.: “would not give permission,” i.e., he did more, he
prohibited them, as the verse goes on to explain, and opposed them
even to the extent of using force.

Psa. 43:1.-“Plead my cause against an ungodly (margin, Heb.,
‘unmerciful’) nation.” Heb. Ма 3cnr (12 chahseed), not merciful, i.e.,
cruel and malignant.

Psa. 51:17.-“A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise: {6., Thou wilt graciously accept and welcome and bless.
Psa. 78:50.-“He spared not their soul from death,” i.e., He gave their
life over to the pestilence.

Psa. 83:1 (2).-“Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and
be not still, О God:” i.e., Arise, О God; and speak; vindicate and
deliver me from mine enemies.

Psa. 84:11.-“No good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly:” {.8., he will give them every good thing, and preserve them
from all evil.

Psa. 107:38.-“And suffereth not their cattle to decrease:” {6., will
abundantly multiply their cattle.

Pro. 12:3.-“A man shall not be established by wickedness:” i.e., he
shall be overthrown.

Pro. 17:21.-“The father of a fool hath no joy:” i.e., he hath plenty of
sorrow.

Pro. 18:5.-“It is not good to accept the person of the wicked,” i.e., it is
a very hateful thing in God’s sight to do so.
Pro. 30:25.-“The ants are a people not strong,” {Θ., very weak.

Isa. 14:6.-“And none hindereth,” {6., all help.

Isa. 42:3.-“A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax
shall he not quench:” i.e., He will strengthen the bruised reed and
kindle to a flame the smouldering wick.

Jer. 2:8.-“The prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things
that do not profit:” i.e., that led to their ruin. So verse 11.

Zec. 8:17.-“Love no false oath,” i.e., hate every such oath.

Mat. 2:6.-And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
among the princes of Juda:” {6., thou art the greatest!

Mat. 12:32.-“It shall not be forgiven him:” {6., he shall have the
gravest punishment in this life and in the life to come (Mar. 3:29). Just
as those, on the other hand, whose sins are forgiven are “blessed”
(Rom. 4:7).

Joh. 6:37.-“Him that cometh to me, | will in no wise cast out.”

Here, there is very much more implied than is expressed in the
literal words. Not only will | not cast him out, but | will by all means
receive him and preserve him, and defend him: he shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck him out of My hand. Compare 10:28, and
see further under Ellipsis (page 106) and Repeated Negation and
Synonymia below.

Joh. 14:18.-‘I will not leave you comfortless,” i.e., | will certainly come
to you by My Holy Spirit and be your ever present help and defence.
Moreover, | will come again and receive you to Mine own self.
Act. 20:12.-“And they brought the young man alive, and were not a
little comforted:” i.e., they were very greatly comforted.
Act. 21:39.-“A citizen of no mean city:” i.e., a very important city.

Tarsus was celebrated as a distinguished seat of Greek
Philosophy and Literature. According to Strabo it ranked with Athens
and Alexandria in the number of its schools and learned men.

Act. 22:18.-“Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for
they will not receive thy testimony concerning me:” i.e., they will not
only reject it, oppose it to the uttermost, but will seek to kill thee.

Act. 26:19.-“I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision”: {6., | was
immediately and altogether obedient. He thus makes his own
obedience more emphatic; while by stating it negatively he denies
what his enemies implied. They implied that he ought to have been
disobedient; but he meets this by asserting that he was “not
disobedient,” /.e., most obedient.

Rom. 1:13.-“I would not have you ignorant, brethren.”

This means very much more than a mere negative wish. It is a
strong positive and earnest desire that they might assuredly know and
be well instructed.

Ignorance is man’s special human infirmity. Animals know more
than man (Isa. 1:3). No animal is so helpless as man in the years of
infancy.

It is remarkable, therefore, that in connection with the Church of
God, and the epistles addressed to churches as such, containing the
special instruction neccssary in consequence of man’s ignorance
concerning the church as the mystery of God, there are six different
occasions on which it is written: “I would not have you ignorant,
brethren.”

“SIX” is the number specially significant of man. Man was created
on the sixth day; and, wherever in Scripture we have this number or
any multiple of it, it always stamps the subject as having to do with
Man.* [Note: Many illustrations of this will be found in Number in
Scripture, by the same author and publisher.]

The significance of these six occurrences of this weighty
expression will be seen by those who have patience to work them out
in the order in which they are given to us by the Holy Spirit.

Rom. 1:13. Of Paul’s purpose to prosecute his great mission and

ministry to the saints in Rome. So chap. 15:23.

Rom. 11:25. That blindness in part is happened to Israel.

10ο. 10:1-11. That the camp in the wilderness was the type of the

baptized assembly under the preaching of the kingdom.

1Со. 12:1. Concerning spiritual things connected with the Church

as the Body of Christ by the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

2Co. 1:8. Of the trouble at Ephesus, at the close of his ministry

there (Act. 19:1-41), when his preaching the kingdom ends and
the revelation of the Mystery begins.
1Th. 4:13. Concerning those that are asleep. Their resurrection
and translation with the saints that are alive at the coming of
the Lord, to be for ever with Him, when the Mystery is
completed.
Rom. 1:16.-“I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:” {6., | count it
my highest honour and glory to proclaim it, and to suffer for it, while |
have full confidence in its power to accomplish all God’s purposes of
grace.
Rom. 4:19.-“And being not weak in faith”: /е., Abraham being very
strong in faith.
Rom. 5:5.-“Hope maketh not ashamed”: {6., it enables us to “rejoice
in hope of the glory of God” (verse 2), and to “joy in God through our
Lord Jesus Christ.” This hope, therefore, is no false hope, but will
prove a great and eternal reality.
Rom. 10:2.-“They have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge.”
By lessening the terms of the expression, the truth is more strongly
stated; and the emphasis is thrown on their blindness and ignorance,
which is enlarged upon in the next verse, while zeal and ignorance are
combined in verse 19. Hence the expression, “not according to
knowledge,” by the figure of Tapeinosis means really with great
blindness.

Rom. 13:10.-“Love worketh no ill to his neighbour’: i.e., it refuses to
work ill, and not only so, but it works good for his neighbour.

1Со. 2:14.-“The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God”: i.e., he does more than this, he rejects them, he will not have
them: why? “For they are foolishness unto him.” This on the one hand
constitutes the guilt of man in the invariable result of the exercise of
his “free-will”: while on the other hand it is equally true as to God’s
sovereignty; “neither can he know them (lit., get to know them),
because they are spiritually discerned.”

1Со. 11:22.-“I praise you not”: i.e., | condemn you in this thing.

2Co. 2:11.-"We are not ignorant of his devices,” i.e., we are very well
aware of them.

Gal. 5:21.-“They which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of
God”: i.e., they shall not only not inherit the kingdom, but shall be cast
out into outer darkness and destroyed without remedy.
Heb. 11:16.-“Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God”:
i.e., God is well-pleased to be their God, and to own them as His
chosen people.

Heb. 13:2.-“Be not forgetful to entertain strangers”: /.e., make it your
business to remember to show hospitality.

Rev. 12:11.-“They loved not their lives unto the death.” The fact
implied is that they disregarded their life to the point of death, and that
because there was One whom they loved more than life and for
whose sake they willingly gave it up.

Rev. 18:7.-“l am no widow’: i.e., | am well-husbanded and prosperous.
