Examples may be classified, in which things are thus vividly
presented to the eye, and so described as to seem very real.

(1) The blessings on the obedience of Israel (Deu. 28:1-14).

(2) The curses and the judgments (Deu. 28:15-45. Isa. 1:6-9; Isa.
34:1-17. Jer. 4:19-31). The greater part of Lamentations (esp., 4:4-8).
(3) The captivity and scattering of Israel (Deu. 28:49-68).

(4) The executioners of Godâ€™s judgments (Isa. 5:26-30).

(5) The hollowness of mere religion, such as existed when Christ
was on earth (Isa. 1:11-15).

(6) The folly of idolators and idols and idolatry (Isa. 44:9-17; Isa.
46:6-7).

(7) The sufferings of Christ (Psa. 22:1-31; lix. Isa. 53:1-12).

(8) The glory and triumph of Christ (Col. 2:14-15, etc.).

(9) Certain similitudes: as when the blessings of Christ's coming
are compared to the rising sun (Mal. 4:2), or a warrior (Rev. 19:11-16);
or when God is compared to a wine-refreshed giant when He arises to
avenge His people (Psa. 78:65-66); or when the godly remnant of
Israel is compared to a Bride (Psa. 45:1-17); or when the prosperity of
the wicked is likened to a green bay-tree (Psa. 37:35); and that of the
righteous to the palm and the cedar (Psa. 92:12-14).
