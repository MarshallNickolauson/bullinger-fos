Enthymema; or, Omission of Premiss

En’-thy-mee-ma. Greek ἐνθύμημα, a thought or a consideration.

This is the opposite of Syllogismus.

In Syllogismus, the premisses are stated, but the conclusion is
omitted; while, in Enthymema, the conclusion is stated and one or
both of the premisses omitted.

Both are alike, therefore, in being an abbreviated Syllogism.

It is also related to Hypocatastasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), in
that it is an implication. But in Hypocatastasis it is an ordinary
statement or word which is to be implied; while, in Enthymema it is the
premiss of an argument which is left to be supplied.

The Latins call it COMMENTUM, a thought or a contrivance, and

CONCEPTIO, the wording or drawing up of a statement.

It may be illustrated thus:-“We are dependent; we should,
therefore, be humble.” Here the major premiss is omitted-“dependent
persons should be humble.”
