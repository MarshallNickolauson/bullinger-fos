Repetitio; or, Repetition

Repetition of the same Word or Words irregularly in the same
Passage

This name is generally given as an alternative to the figure of
Geminatio or Epizeuxis. But as that figure already has several names,
and there is another form of repetition which seems to be without a
name, we have appropriated Repetitio (i.e., Repetition), to that form
which comes under none of the figures already enumerated.

A word or words are repeated, not in immediate succession, as in
Epizeuxis; not at the beginning, middle, or end of sentences (as in
those just treated); not at definite intervals; but frequently in the same
passage and irregularly for the sake of emphasizing and calling
attention to it.

The name clearly defines the nature of the figure, which may
frequently be met with.
