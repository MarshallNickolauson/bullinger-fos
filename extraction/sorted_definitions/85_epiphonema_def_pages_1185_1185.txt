Epiphonema; or, Exclamation

Addition of Conclusion by way of Exclamation

Ep?-i-pho?-nee?-ma (ἐπιφώνημα), from ἐτή (ερῆ, upon, and @wveiv
(pho?nein), to speak. Hence, something uttered besides; an
exclamation at the conclusion of a sentence.

When the exclamation occurs as an independent separate
passage, then it is called Ecphonesis or Exclamatio (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ), and does not come under this division as a mere addition of
words; but rather under their application as an expression of feeling.
See Ecphonesis.

And note, further, that, when the exclamation is thrown in
parenthetically, it is called Interjectio (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

Epiphonema is called also DEINOSIS when it is very brief and
emphatic, from δείνωσις, an enhancing, exaggerating.
