Epicrisis; or, Judgment

Addition of Conclusion by way of Deduction
Ep’-i-cri’-sis, from the Greek ἐπὶ (epi), upon, and κρίσις (krisis), a
judgment sentence. Hence Epicrisis is used as an adjudication.

It is a short sentence added at the end by way of an additional
conclusion, other and more than has been already stated: not
necessary to the sense of it, but as showing that there is something
more and something deeper than what lies on the surface.

It notes a cause or a consequence arising from the place,
occasion, end, or effect, of things, actions, or speeches.
