Apocope; or, End-Cut

A-péc’-o-pe is the Greek word ἁποκοπή, a cutting off, from
atrokotrTelv (apokoptein), to cut off, and this from ἁπό (apo), away
from, and кбптем (koptein), to cut. № is a figure of etymology which
relates to the spelling of words, and is used of cutting off a letter or
syllable from the end of a word. We may give it the name of END-
CUT. We have examples in such words as yon for yonder, after for
afterward.

In the Scripture we have an example in the name of Jude for
Judas.

There is no Apocope in the Greek; and therefore there is no
teaching in the use of the figure; which exists only in the translation.
