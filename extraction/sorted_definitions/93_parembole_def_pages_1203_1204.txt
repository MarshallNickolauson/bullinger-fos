Parembole; or, Insertion

Parenthetic Independent Addition

Par-em -bol-ee’ (παρεμβολή), from παρά (para), beside, év (en), in,
and βολή (bolee), a throwing or casting (from βάλλω, ball?, to throw).

Hence, a Parembole is an insertion beside, between, or among
others; and the name is used when the sentence interposed is
independent and complete in itself; and would make complete sense if
it were separated from the sentence which it divides.

It is called also EPEMBOLE (Ep-em’-bol-ee, ἑπεμβολή), from ἐτί
(epi), upon, ἓν (en), in, and βολή (bolee), a casting. A casting in upon.

And PAREMPTOSIS (Par-emp-to -sis, παρέµττωσις), from παρά
(para), beside, év (en), in, and πτῶσις (pt?sis), a falling (from τήπτω,
to fall), a falling in beside.
