Euche; or, Prayer

An Expression of Feeling by way of Prayer, Curse, or Imprecation

Eu’-chee. Greek, εὐχή, а prayer, wish, or vow. Latin VOTUM.

This includes a prayer, or wish; also a prayer for evil; hence curse,
imprecation.

This figure is a change by which a statement is expressed as a
prayer, instead of as a matter of fact. And where the prayer comes in
by way of parenthesis caused by the sudden change.

Its use arises from and betokens an excited Condition of feeling.

The Scriptures abound with examples of all kinds, which may be
sought out and studied for instruction and example.
