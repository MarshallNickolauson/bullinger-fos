Type

A figure or ensample of something future and more or less prophetic,
called the “Antitype”

Type. Greek, τύπος (typos). The verb τύπτειν (tuptein), to strike, make
an impress. Hence Type means primarily a blow; then, the impress or
mark left by a blow; then, a mark, print, or impress of any kind.

In the New Testament the word occurs in several of these senses.

It is rendered:-
1. Α print or mark (Joh. 20:25).* [Note: The second occurrence
in this verse is read OU, the place, by Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Tregelles (margin).]

2. Figure (Act. 7:43. Rom. 5:14).

3. Form (Rom. 6:17).

4. Fashion (Act. 7:44).

5. Manner (Act. 23:25).

6. Pattern (Tit. 2:7. Heb. 8:5).

7. Ensample (10ο. 10:11. Php. 3:17. 1Th. 1:7).¢ [Note:
According to the best texts, this is singular, as in R.V., not
plural.] 2Th. 3:9. 1Pe. 5:3

8. Example (1Co. 10:6. 1Ti. 4:12).

The Greeks used it of the symptoms of a disease. Galen wrote a
medical work entitled περὶ τῶν τύπων, concerning symptoms. In a
Legal sense it was used of what we technically cite as a “case.”

It will thus be seen that the special and technical sense which has
been given to it by Theologians is not exactly equivalent to any of
these usages: the nearest being Rom. 5:14, where Adam is spoken of
as a type of the Coming One.

The theological use of the word agrees more with what in the New
Testament is called σκιά (skia), a shadow (Heb. 10:1-39 i. Col. 2:17).

There is, therefore, not much profit in following out what have been
called types by men. Many are merely illustrations; and it would be
better so to call them; inasmuch as they did not and do not of
themselves teach the truths, but only illustrate those truths which are
elsewhere clearly revealed. We should never have called them types
but for such subsequent revelation; and therefore they are only
illustrations so far as their teaching agrees with clear revelation
afterward made.
