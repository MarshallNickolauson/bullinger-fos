Synathroesmos; or, Enumeration

The Enumeration of the Parts of a Whole which has not been
mentioned

Syn’-ath-roes’-mos. Greek, συναθροίσµος (syn-ath-rois-mos),
gathering together, assembling. It is used of an assemblage of terms
or species brought together without being first mentioned as a whole,
and not being necessarily the distribution of the parts of any one thing.

The figure is also called APARITHMESIS (ap-a-rith -mee-sis), from
ἀπό (apo), from or off, and ἀριθμεῖν (arithmein), to count. Hence, to
count off, enumerate. The Latins, from this, called it ENUMERATIO,
which has the same meaning. The Latin term for Synathroesmus is
CONGERIES (con-ge’-ri-ees), from con, together, and gerere, to bear,
carry or bring; and denotes a heap, or combination.

From the fact that such enumeration or combination sometimes
made the argument or statement drag, the figure was called
SYRMOS, which is the Greek συρµός (syrmos), a trailing, from σύρειν
(surein), to drag, trail along. And, because a number of different words
were thus united, it was also called EIRMOS (eir’-mos), from eipw
(eir?), to string together.

It differs from Merismus in that the things enumerated are not first
briefly mentioned under one head: and it differs from Synonymia, in
that they are not synonymous, but may be of many kinds and
descriptions.

It also differs from Symperasma, in that they do not occur at the
conclusion, but in the course of what is said.

The use of the figure is to enrich a discourse, or part of it, by
enumerating particulars, or by multiplying epithets.

All the figures which we are grouping under this head are figures
of Amplification, otherwise this is called by some Amplificatio. But we
have used this as a general term for the whole group and have not
restricted it to any one particular figure.
