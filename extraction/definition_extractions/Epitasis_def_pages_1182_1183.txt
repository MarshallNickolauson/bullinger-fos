Epitasis; or, Amplification

Addition of Conclusion by way of Emphasis

E-pit’-a-sis (ἑπίτασις), a stretching, from ἑτή (epi), upon, and Teivelv
(teinein), to stretch or extend.

The Figure is used when a concluding sentence is added by way
of increasing the emphasis. It is not independent of what has gone
before, but it is some emphatic increase added to it by way of
conclusion.

The Latins called it INTENTIO, which means the same thing, a
straining, or tension; increase, or augmentation

The difference between this figure and the figure of Amplification is
that it comes by way of Conclusion.
