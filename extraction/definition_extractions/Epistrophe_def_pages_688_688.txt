Epistrophe; or, Like Sentence-Endings

The Repetition of the same Word or Words at the end of successive
Sentences
E-pis’-tro-phee. Greek ἐπιστροφή, a turning upon or wheeling about,
from ἐπί (epi), upon, and στρέφω (strepho), to turn.

It is a figure in which the same word or words are repeated at the
end of successive sentences or clauses, instead of (as in Anaphora)
at the beginning.

It is sometimes called ANTISTROPHE (an-tis’-tro-phee), a turning
against; also EPIPHORA (e-piph -o-ra), a bringing to or upon.

The Latin name is CONVERSIO (con-ver’-si-o), a turning round.

All these titles express the character of the figure, which is thus the
opposite of Anaphora.
