Anastrophe; or, Arraignment

The position of One word changed so as to be set over against the
Other

A-nas’-tro-phee. Greek, > (/!)!\=, from ©' = (ana), back again, and Г›
5'' (strephein), to turn, a turning back.

The figure is so-called because one word is turned, or turned back
out of its proper or usual position in a sentence.

Hence it is a kind of Hyperbaton; but affecting only one word,
instead of several words, in a sentence.

It is called also PARALLAGE, Par-al’-la-gee. Greek, ©0\\°>, from
ους ΤΠ] (parallasso), to make things alternate. Hence Parallage
means a deviation, a turning aside, variation. And
SYNCATEGOREMA, syn-cat’-ee-gor-ee-ma, from '” (syn), together
with, and (| ©) an arraignment. Hence the figure is so called
because one word is set over against or arraigned against another.
Reversal would be a good English name for this figure.

The Latins called it TRAJECTIO: i.e., a crossing over, a
transposition or trajection of words. And INVERSIO, a turning about,
an inversion of words.

The word thus put out of its usual place receives great emphasis.
