See also Jer. 48:3-46; and Luk. 18:9-14, where the Pharisee and
the Publican are described by their manner, gesture, etc.

In 1Ре. 3:3, where women are exhorted to show the disposition of
mind by avoiding the outward costume which is described.

When the description or expression is confined to the feelings it is
called

Pathopeeia; or, Description of Feelings
Path’-o-poe-i-a. Greek, παθοποῄα, from πάθος, feeling, and ποιεῖν.
(poiein), to make. Hence, the figure is so named, when the feelings
and affections are described or expressed.

For examples, see Isa. 22:4; Isa. 49:15. Jer. 9:1-2; Jer. 23:9; Jer.
31:20. Hos. 11:7-9. Mar. 3:5; Mar. 6:32; Mar. 7:34; Mar. 10:14; Mar.
10:21. Luk. 19:41. 2Co. 2:4. Gal. 4:19-20.

We have included this figure here, and also under those involving
change, because sometimes this description is given by way of
additional information, and sometimes it is given instead of naming or
otherwise indicating the person or thing spoken of.
The reader must distinguish these examples himself.
When the description is confined to sayings, it is called
Mimesis; or, Description of Sayings
Mi-mee-sis, from the Greek µίµησις (mi-mee-sis), imitation, from
μιµεῖσθαι (mimeisthai), to imitate.

The name is used when the sayings (and sometimes motions and
thoughts) of another are described or imitated by way of emphasis.

Hence called by the Latins IMITATIO, imitation.

See Exo. 15:9 (see Asyndeton). Psa. 137:7; Psa. 144:12-15 (see
Ellipsis). Ι58. 14:13-14; Isa. 28:15. Hos. 14:2-3. Eze. 36:2. Mic. 2:11;
Mic. 3:11.

So also 1Co. 15:35, and Php. 3:4-5.

Sometimes there is a use of a word which another is wont to use,
and which is repeated so as delicately, but yet acutely, to direct him
aright. As in 2Co. 10:1; 2Co. 10:10; and Gal. 6:2.
