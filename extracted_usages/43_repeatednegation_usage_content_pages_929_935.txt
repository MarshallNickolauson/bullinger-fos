This difference may be seen in such passages as 1Co. 2:14 (οὐ).
Joh. 3:18, where we have οὐ in the first sentence, and µή (both times)
in the second.

Mat. 22:29.-“Ye do err not (µή, mee), knowing the Scriptures.” Here
the µή (mee) denies subjectively, not absolutely, implying that though
they did actually know the letter, they did not wish to know their truth.

When however they and their compounds, οὐδὲ µή (oude mee),
and οὖδε οὐ µή (oude ou mee), are used together, this difference is
sunk, and the combination produces a most solemn and emphatic
asseveration.

Indeed, so strong is it, that whenever man used it the result always
belied it. See:-

Mat. 16:22 : where Peter says “This shall not be unto thee.” But it
was.
Joh. 13:8 : Peter says again, “Thou shalt never wash my feet.” But
Christ did.
Mat. 26:35 : where Peter affirms “I will not deny thee.” But he did.
Joh. 20:25 : Thomas says, “Except | shall see, etc., | will not believe.”
But he did.

On the other hand, our Lord often used this figure: and, whenever
He did so, He always made it good:-
Mat. 5:18.-“Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle* [Note: This
is a little ornament something like a fleur-de-lis over certain letters.
The Hebrew name for this is Taag, or little crown (plural Taagim). The
Greek is ё:5\ (keraia), a little horn, which is exactly what the Taag is.
See The Massorah, by the same author and publisher, One Shilling.
The jot or yod is the smallest letter of the alphabet. For full information
on this subject see Dr. Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Hebrew Bible,
published by the Trinitarian Bible Society.] shall in no wise pass from
the law, etc.” Here we have the certainty of Divine Truth.

Mat. 5:20.-“Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
kingdom of heaven.” Here we have the absolute necessity of Divine
righteousness.

Mat. 5:26.-“Thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast
paid the uttermost farthing.” Here we have the inflexibility of Divine
justice.

Mat. 13:14.-As in Act. 28:26, we have here the solemn announcement
concerning Israel's judicial blindness, emphasising and strengthening
its certainty.

Mat. 16:28.-The certainty of His promise as to the manifestation of His
coming glory (see 17:1-5, and 2Pe. 1:16-18).
Mat. 18:3.-The absolute necessity of conversion.
Mat. 23:39.-The certainty of His words concerning the conditions as to
His return.
Mat. 24:2.-Completeness of the overthrow and dismemberment of the
Temple.
Mat. 24:21.-The greatness of the tribulation.
Mat. 24:34.-The fact that when once these things begin to come to
pass (γέηται, not πληρόω, compare Luk. 21:24; Luk. 21:32), that
generation which sees the abomination of desolation set up (verse 15)
shall see “all these things” come to pass.
Mat. 24:35.-The inviolability of Christ’s words.

Mat. 26:29.-The certitude of Christ's pledge (Mar. 14:25. Luk.
22:18).

Luk. 6:37.-The certainty of divers promises. So Luk. 10:19.

Luk. 18:7.-The speediness of the Divine avenging.

Luk. 18:30.-The certainty of the future recompense.

Luk. 21:18.-The perfectness of Divine protection.
Luk. 22:67-68.-The accuracy of the Lord’s foreknowledge.

Joh. 4:14.-The satisfying power of the Divine gifts.

Joh. 4:48.-The obstinacy of unbelief.

Joh. 6:35.-The satisfying power of “the bread of life.”

Joh. 8:12.-The perfection of the Divine light.

Joh. 8:51-52.-Eternal security for the keepers of Christ's sayings.

Joh. 10:5.-The miraculous power of His sheep’s spiritual instinct.

Joh. 10:28.-The Divine preservation of Christ's sheep.

Joh. 11:26.-The certainty of being “changed in a moment” for those
who are “alive and remain’ till His coming.

Once this repeated negation was used by an angel-Gabriel, in Luk.
1:15, of John the Baptist, that “he shall neither drink wine nor strong
drink.” And this was perfectly fulfilled (Mat. 11:18).

But there is one more use of the figure by Christ, so blessed and
so important that we have reserved it to the last:-
Joh. 6:37.-“All (πᾶν 6, pan ho, everything) that the Father giveth
me shall come to (ἤξει, heexei, will reach) me; and him that cometh
(τόν ἐρχόμενον, ton erchomenon, he who is on his way to) to me | will
in no wise cast out.”

The repeated “not” in the Greek is thus beautifully rendered, and
George Keith effectively sums it up in his hymn on Heb. 13:5 : “I will
never leave thee nor forsake thee,” where we have the οὐ µή in both
clauses:-

“The soul that on Jesus has fled for repose,

He cannot, He will not desert to his foes;

That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,
He'll never, no never, no never forsake.”
