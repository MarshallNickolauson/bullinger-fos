Negatio; or, Negation
Spontaneous Negation

Negation is used in a similar way as a Figure, when it is a denying of
that which has not been affirmed: i.e., when, instead of merely making
a statement, it is put in the form of a denial.

Paul uses it in Gal. 2:5, “To whom we gave place by subjection,
no, not for an hour.” (See Synecdoche).

When the negation is very important, the negative is repeated, or
combined with another negative to increase its emphasis. See
Repeated Negation.
Accismus; or, Apparent Refusal
Ac-cis’-mus, a cutting all but through, from the Latin, accido. This
Figure is so named because it is an apparent or assumed refusal.

Mat. 15:22-26.-When the woman of Canaan cried “Have mercy on
me, O Lord, thou Son of David,” the Lord did not intend to reject her:
but, having no claim (as a Gentile) on Christ as the “Son of David,” He
uses the figure Accismus, and apparently refuses her request by
saying, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

“Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord help me.” But
again, there was no confession as to the “me.” It was not like the
Publican, “God be merciful to me-a sinner.” It might have been a self-
righteous “me.”

So the Lord again uses the Figure Accismus, but He now
combines it with Hypocatastasis; and says:

“It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to

dogs.”

Now came the confession-she saw the point. She admitted the fact
as to her condition as “a dog of the Gentiles,” and said, “Truth, Lord:”
and received the blessing which had been determined for her.
