Epidiegesis; or, Re-Statement
A Repetition in order to restate in full
Ep -i-di’-e-ge’-sis, a repetition of the statement of a case or narration
of facts: from ἑτή (epi), upon, and διήγησις (dieegeesis), the statement
of a case (from διηγέοµαι, dieegeomai, to describe or narrate in
detail).

This is a kind of Prosapodosis: and it is so called when the
repetition is for the purpose not of explanation, but of kindling emotion,
provoking indignation, or evoking comparison.

Epexegesis; or, Fuller Explaining
