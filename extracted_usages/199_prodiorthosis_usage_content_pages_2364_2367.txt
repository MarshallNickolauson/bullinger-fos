Whereas the one and only true religion is expressed in the words,
“NOTHING in my hand | bring.”
So that a man may be “very religious,” and yet be unsaved, and
“far off’ from God (Eph. 2:13).
Act. 26:2-3 is another beautiful example of true Protherapeia. See
also 22:3-6, etc.
Prodiorthosis; or, Warning
Something said to prepare for a shock
Pro’-di-or-tho’-sis. Greek, προδιόρθωσις, a preparatory apology, from
πρό (pro), before, and διόρθωσις (diorthosis), a making straight,
putting right; from διορθόω (diorthosd), to make straight, set straight.
This is the previous Figure of Protherapeia used to prepare the
hearers or readers for what might otherwise shock or offend them.
Palinodia; or, Retracting
Approval of one Thing after reproving for another Thing

Pal’-i-noédd’-i-a. Greek, TraAivwoia, a song repeated a second time;
hence a retracting of a former one.

The Figure is used when, having spoken against or reproved any
person or thing, we speak well of him or it.

Examples may be found in some of the Epistles to the Seven
Churches.

Ephesus: Rev. 2:6, after the reproof of verses 4 and 5.

Sardis: Rev. 3:4; Rev. 5:1-14, after the reproof of verse 1.

In the Old Testament, examples may be seen in 2Ch. 15:17; 2Ch.
19:3. Psa. 89:33; Psa. 106:8; Psa. 106:44.
