Ι. Apostrophe to God

of his enemies to address God (by Apostrophe) in prayer: “Hear, O
our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their
own head,” etc.

weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now, therefore, O God,
strengthen my hands.”

good, deliver thou me,” etc.

verses 1-6 he turns away, and apostrophizes the rich oppressors,

2. To one’s own self

This is done by the common Hebrew idiom, by which one’s “soul” is
put (by Synecdoche) for one’s self.
Psa. 42:5; Psa. 42:11 (6, 12).-“Why art thou cast down, O my soul.”
See also under Cycloides, Heterosis, and Synecdoche.

So Psa. 104:1; Psa. 146:1, etc.

Synecdoche, for anyone)

addresses anyone who is in like circumstances, and exhorts him.

“О man’). See under Antimetathesis and Metonymy. Gal. 4:7 (“thou”).

(instead of indirectly or obliquely).

(See under Polyptoton, and compare Mat. 13:14. Act. 28:26-27,
etc.)

IV. Apostrophe to Inanimate Things
Deu. 32:1.-“Give ear, О ye heavens, and | will speak: and hear, О
earth, the words of my mouth.”

Thus solemnly and emphatically opens this “Song of Moses”
(which describes the whole history of Israel from the beginning to the
end) and call us to give our attention to it and to consider it.

As every Israelite was expected to learn and study it (566 verses
44-47) its importance to the interpreter of prophecy must be very great
indeed. It is the key to Israel's history-past, present, and future.

Its structure may be seen under Correspondence (page 375).
2Sa. 1:21.-“Ye mountains of Gilboa.”
1К!. 13:2.-“And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and
said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord, etc.”

Psa. 114:5.-“What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou
Jordan, that thou wast driven back? Ye mountains that ye skipped like
rams? and ye little hills, like lambs? Tremble, thou earth, at the
presence of the Lord (Adon), at the presence of the God (Eloah) of
Jacob.”

Psa. 148:3-5.-“Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars
of light. Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be
above the heavens,” etc.

spoken.”

Parecbasis; or, Digression
A temporary Turning Aside from one Subject to another

Par-ek’-ba-sis. Greek, παρέκβασις, a digression, from παρα (para),
beside, ἐκ (ek), out of, or from, and βάσις (basis), a stepping (from
βαΐνειν (bainein), to step).

A figure by which the speaker or writer steps from beside his
subject, and makes a digression, changing his subject-matter, and
adding something beyond the scope of his subject, though necessary
to it. Sometimes this digression is mentioned, and a promise given to
return to it again.
