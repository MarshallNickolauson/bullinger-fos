4. Repetition of Sentences and phrases
Cycloides; or, Circular Repetition
The Repetition of the same Phrase at regular Intervals
Cy-clo-id’-es means having the form of a circle; from κύκλος (kuklos).
a circle, and εἶδος (eidos), form.

The figure is so called because the sentence or phrase is repeated
at intervals, as though in regular circles.

When this repetition occurs at the end of successive passages, as
in poetry, in the form of a Refrain or Burden, it is called AMCEBZON
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ). But when it occurs at the beginning or
middle or any other part of the passage it is called Cycloides.
2Sa. 1:19; 2Sa. 1:25; 2Sa. 1:27.-Where we have the burden of the
lamentation three times, “How are the mighty fallen.”

Psa. 42:5; Psa. 42:11 (6, 12) and 43:5.-We have the three-fold
emphasis on the great question: “Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
and the blessed answer, “Hope thou in God!”

Psa. 46:7; Psa. 46:11.-Here, the phrase occurs twice, “The Lord of
hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.”

Psa. 56:4; Psa. 56:10 (5, 11).-Where we have the sentence repeated,
to emphasize the fact that when our enemies seem mightiest, we can
say, “In God will | praise His word.”

Psa. 80:3; Psa. 80:7; Psa. 80:19 (4, 8, 20).-Three times we have the
prayer: “Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine, and we
shall be saved.”

Jer. 3:12; Jer. 3:22.-Where we have the twice repeated command to
the backsliding People to “return.”

Eze. 32:20-26; Eze. 32:28-32, -Twelve times we have the expression
repeated “Slain with the sword,” at intervals, irregularly, but twelve
times to denote the judgment as being executed by Divine
government.* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author and
publisher.]
AmecebZon; or, Refrain
The Repetition of the same Phrase at the End of successive
Paragraphs

Am-ce-bf-on. № is from the Greek ἁμοιβή (amoibee), change,
alteration (from ἁμείβειν (ameibein), to change. It is used of the
repetition of the same phrase or sentence, where it occurs in poetry at
the end of successive periods.

Cycloides may occur at the beginning, or middle, or any part of the
circle, but AmoebZon only at the end.

This burden, therefore, thus emphasized is the main point for us to
notice in what is being said.
Psa. 118:1-4.-Where, we have the refrain “For His mercy endureth for
ever.” (See under Symploce).
Psa. 136:1-26 -Where at the end of every verse, we have the refrain,
“For His mercy endureth for ever.”
Isa. 9:12; Isa. 9:17; Isa. 9:21; Isa. 10:4.-Where we have the four-fold
burden, to emphasize the solemn warning, “For all this his anger is not
turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”
