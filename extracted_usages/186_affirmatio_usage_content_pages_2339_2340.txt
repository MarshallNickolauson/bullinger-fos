The Latins called it SUBJECTIO, a substituting, RESPONSIO, a
responding.

It is a form of Dialogismos (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).

Affirmatio; or, Affirmation
Spontaneous Affirmation

Affirmation becomes a Figure when it is used otherwise than in
answer to a question; or, instead of a bare statement of the fact.

It emphasizes the words thus to affirm what no one has disputed.

The Apostle uses it in Php. 1:18, “What then? notwithstanding,
every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and |
therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”
Negatio; or, Negation
Spontaneous Negation

Negation is used in a similar way as a Figure, when it is a denying of
that which has not been affirmed: i.e., when, instead of merely making
a statement, it is put in the form of a denial.

Paul uses it in Gal. 2:5, “To whom we gave place by subjection,
no, not for an hour.” (See Synecdoche).

When the negation is very important, the negative is repeated, or
combined with another negative to increase its emphasis. See
Repeated Negation.
