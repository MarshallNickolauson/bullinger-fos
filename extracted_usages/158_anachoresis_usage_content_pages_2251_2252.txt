ἀνά (ana), back, and χώρησις (choreesis), a withdrawing or retiring
(from χωρέω, chore, to retire, withdraw).

This figure is a return from a digression which has been made.
Hence called by the Latins, REGRESSIO, a regression, and
RECESSIO, a receding or recession.

The Greeks had another name for it, calling it EPANACLESIS, Ep-
an-a-clee-sis, from ἐτή (epi), upon, ava (ana), back, κλῆσις (kleesis), a
calling (from καλέω (Ка/еб), to call), a calling back upon, or recalling,
in the sense of returning from a digression.

See Eph. 3:14, where the subject commenced in verse 1 is
resumed.

Rom. 1:7, where the subject (the salutation) commenced in verse
1 is resumed.

Further examples will easily be found by the observant reader.
Prolepsis (Ampliatio); or, Anticipation
An Anticipation of some future Time which cannot yet be enjoyed: but
has to be deferred
Pro-leep-sis. Greek, πρόληψις, a taking beforehand, anticipation.

The Figure is so called when we anticipate what is going to be
done, and speak of future things as present.

The name is also given to the Figure when we anticipate what is
going to be said, and meet an opponent’s objection. But that Prolepsis
is distinguished by the further description “Occupatio”; because, in that
case, the opponent’s objection is not only anticipated, but seized and
taken possession of (as the word means).

Whereas Prolepsis-when it anticipates time which it cannot hold or
keep possession of, but has to defer it, after having anticipated itis
distinguished from the other by the word “Ampliatio,” which means an
adjourning.

God Himself used the figure in Gen. 1:28, when he spoke to both
our first parents as then already present, though the building of Eve
did not take place till the time spoken of in chap. 2:20-23.
