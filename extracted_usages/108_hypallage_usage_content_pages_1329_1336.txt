Gen. 10:9.-“A strong man of hunting”: {.Θ., a mighty hunter, as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

Here, according to the ordinary usage, the word “hunting” would
be (by Enallage) the qualifying word: a hunting man of strength; but,
by Hypallage, there is an Interchange, by which the noun becomes the
adjective: a mighty hunter.

Gen. 29:14.-“And he abode with him a month of days”: {6., the days

waters”: i.e., taken or cut off the waters of the city. 2Sa. 12:28 shows

When, therefore, in verse 26, it is said he “took the royal city,” it
must mean the royal part of the city, where the king resided.
1Ki. 17:14.-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The barrel of meal (i.e.,

the saints be delivered from their conflict between the old and the new
natures. It cannot be accomplished by vows or resolutions, or by
discipline, which is the fond idea and aim of all who are ignorant of this
teaching, from Rome to Keswick.

Gal. 6:1.-“The spirit of meekness”: i.e., meekness of spirit.

Eph. 1:9.-“The mystery of His will.”

The word µυστήριον (musteerion) rendered mystery always means
a secret. And here it is the Secret pertaining to God’s purpose: i.e., the
Secret which He hath purposed; or, by the figure Hypallage, His
Secret purpose, because the noun in regimen is the word qualified
instead of the word which qualifies.

In Jdt. 2:2 we have the remarkable expression: Nebuchadnezzar
“called together all his servants, and all his great men, and
communicated with them his secret counsel”: i.e., the secret of his will.
The word µυστήριον is the same in each case, but in the case of
Nebuchadnezzar it was the secret of his βουλή (boulee): i.e., his will,
because he had determined it: while in Eph. 1:9, it is the secret of
God’s θέληµα (theleema): i.e., His will, because He desired it. Hence
the meaning is “God’s secret purpose or counsel.”

Heb. 9:15.-“That ... they which are called might receive the promise of
