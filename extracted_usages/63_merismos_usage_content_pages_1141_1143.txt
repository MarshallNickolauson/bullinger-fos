thing has been named and mentioned, it is divided up, and the various
parts are added together to enhance the effect, increase the
emphasis, and amplify the sense.

Lord God (Adonai Jehovah),” the word is spoken, not only to the

And all this to show how complete shall be the blessing for the
land of Israel.

Synathroesmos; or, Enumeration
The Enumeration of the Parts of a Whole which has not been
mentioned

Syn’-ath-roes’-mos. Greek, συναθροίσµος (syn-ath-rois-mos),
gathering together, assembling. It is used of an assemblage of terms
or species brought together without being first mentioned as a whole,
and not being necessarily the distribution of the parts of any one thing.

The figure is also called APARITHMESIS (ap-a-rith -mee-sis), from
ἀπό (apo), from or off, and ἀριθμεῖν (arithmein), to count. Hence, to
count off, enumerate. The Latins, from this, called it ENUMERATIO,
which has the same meaning. The Latin term for Synathroesmus is
CONGERIES (con-ge’-ri-ees), from con, together, and gerere, to bear,
carry or bring; and denotes a heap, or combination.
