Mat. 21:29 is sometimes given as an example; but this was a real
refusal, altered by after repentance.
tiologia; or, Cause Shown
The rendering a Reason for what is said or done
Ae -ti-o-log‘-ia (Aetiology). Greek Αἰτιολογία, rendering a reason, from
aitia (aitia), a cause, and λόγος (logos), a description.

The figure is used when, either directly or indirectly, the speaker or
writer renders a reason for what he thinks, says, or does.

The figure was also called APODEIXIS (Ap-o-deix’-is). Greek,
ἀπόδειξις, full demonstration, from ἀποδεικνύναι (apodeiknunai), to
point out, demonstrate.

The Latins called it CAUS. REDDITIO: rendering a reason, or
showing the cause.
Rom. 1:13.-Νονν | would not have you ignorant, brethren, that
oftentimes | purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that |
might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
Gentiles.”

Verses 15, 16: “l am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at
Rome also. For | am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the
power of God unto salvation.”

So Rom. 3:20; Rom. 4:14-15, and all other passages where the
word “For” points out the reason, or “Therefore” shows the cause.

These are too numerous to be quoted; but their significance
should always be noted.

Anteisagoge; or, Counter-Question
The Answering of one Question by asking another
