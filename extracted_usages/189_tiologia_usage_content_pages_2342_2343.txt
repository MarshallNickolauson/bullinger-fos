Rom. 1:13.-Νονν | would not have you ignorant, brethren, that
oftentimes | purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that |
might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
Gentiles.”

Verses 15, 16: “l am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at
Rome also. For | am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the
power of God unto salvation.”

So Rom. 3:20; Rom. 4:14-15, and all other passages where the
word “For” points out the reason, or “Therefore” shows the cause.

These are too numerous to be quoted; but their significance
should always be noted.
