Mat. 3:9.-“God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham.”

Here, there is no Paronomasia either in the Greek or the English,
but there is in the Hebrew thought. Hence, these would be this
Parechesis:-
fadéi (abanim), stones.
ἀᾷ6{ (banim), children.

“God is able of these abanim to raise up banim unto Abraham.”
Mat. 10:30.-“The very hairs of your head are all numbered.” idf,
mene, and idél, manyan.
Mat. 11:17.-“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced
(ὠρξήσασθε, dprcheesasthe): we have mourned unto you, and ye
have not lamented (ἐκόψασθε, ekopsasthe).

There is a Homeeoteleuton in these two Greek words but no
Paronomasia. The Parachesis is seen by the Syriac, referring to which
the Lord doubtless used. There we see a beautiful example of
Paronomasia, for the word “danced” would be r-auld, rakedton,
and the word “lamented” would be ff-auld, arkedton.

In the English it would be:-“We have piped unto you and ye did not
leap: we have mourned unto you, and ye do not weep.”

Mat. 11:29.-“l am meek, and ye shall find rest.”

In the Peshito we have dé¢ (nich), and décf (n’yacha), and
better still in the Lewis-Codex IFG@¢Eld’ (v’enichkon), ie., / shall
give you rest,” i.e., | ат neech and v’eneechk¢pn.

Mar. 8:32.-The words of Peter to Jesus are rendered in the Lewis-
Codex:-“As if he pitied him: be it far from thee.” This is arn, haes;
cn, chas.
Luk. 7:41-42.-See Rom. 13:8.
Joh. 1:5.-“The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not.”

In Syriac the word “darkness” would be -aé, keval, and
“comprehend” would be -ἀδ, kabbel.

Joh. 10:1.-“He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold” would
be id urn écéif, min tara letora.
Rom. 13:8.-“Owe no man anything but to оуе one another.”

In the Greek (as in the English) these words are very different: but,
to a Hebrew, the two words would immediately be, in the mind, ρά
(Ό, acheb and cla, chab. “Спфу, be debtor to no man, but achBb
one another.” The same is seen in Luk. 7:41-42.

Rom. 15:4.-“That we through patience ... might have hope.” This
would be naf, sabbar and nlay, subar (from the same root).

“That we through sabbar might have saubar.”
1Co. 1:23-24.-“We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-
block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are
called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the
wisdom of God.”

Here, there is a beautiful combination of words. By a simple
change of letters, the words signify cross, stumbling-block,
foolishness, power, and wisdom:-

iiéé (maskal) is cross.

JEUIE (michshepl) is stumbling-block.

néé (sechel) is foolishness.

Δὐδόδ (haschil) is power: ᾖθ., prosperity or success
resulting from power in doing anything.

uéé (sechel) is wisdom (1Ch. 22:12; 1Ch. 26:14. Pro. 12:8).

So that the whole passage would sound, in reading, thus:-“We
preach Christ, maskal, to the Jews michshgpl, and to the Greeks
sekel, but to them that are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
haschil of God and the sechel of God.”
2Co. 11:17.-“But as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.”
Here, foolishness and boasting are (from the same root)-
AUAEE (hithaltel) and
AUAIEES (nitheplel).
(d) With a different sound (but similar sense)
