|. Alternate Correspondence of Subjects

This is when the subjects of the alternate members correspond with
each other, either by way of similiarity or contrast.

We now give a few examples selected from all parts of Scripture.

1. Simple Alternation

We so call it when it consists of only four members: i.e., two series
with two members each. In this case the first member of the first
series corresponds with the first member of the second, while the
second member of the first series corresponds with the second
member of the second series.

In other words, it is alternate when, of the four members, the first
corresponds with the third, and the second with the fourth.
Jos. 9:22-25.-
А 22. The question of Joshua. “And Joshua called.”
В 23. The sentence of Joshua. “Now therefore” (Aa),
veattah).
Α 24. The reply of the Gibeonites. “And they answered.”
B 25. Submission to Joshua’s sentence. “Now, behold”
(Awa, veattah),
Psa. 19:1-14 -
А 1-4-. The heavens.
В -4-θ. The sun in them (AA, bahem, in them).
Α 7-10. The Scriptures.
В 11-14. Thy servant in them (Aa, bahem, in them).
Pro. 1:8-19.-
Α 8. Two-fold exhortation. “My son, hear ... forsake not.”
Β 9. Reason. “For they shall be,” etc.
А 10-15. Two-fold exhortation. “My son, if ... my son walk not.”
В 16-19. Reason. “For their feet,” etc.
Isa. 32:5-7.-
А The vile person shall be no more called liberal,
В Nor the churl said to be bountiful.

А For the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work
iniquity to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the
Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause
the drink of the thirsty to fail.

В The instruments of the churl are evil; he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when
the needy speaketh right.”

Here, in A, and A, we have the vile person; while in B and B we

have the churl. A and B are negative; and A and B are positive.
Jer. 17:5-8.-

A 5. Cursed is the man (aafr, gever)* [Note: Gever is vir, a
strong man.] that trusteth in man (fai, adam)t [Note: Adam is
homo, a created man, and is thus put in contrast with Jehovah
in A. and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth
from the Lord.

В 6. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched
places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

А 7. Blessed is the man (aafr, gever) that trusteth in the Lord,
and whose hope the Lord is.

В 8. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when
heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be
careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from
yielding fruit.

Eze. 36:26-27.-

А “Anew heart also will | give you,

В And anew spirit will | put within you:

А And | will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and |

will give you an heart of flesh.

В And Iwill put my Spirit within you.

Here, in this prophecy concerning Israel in the day of their coming
glory, there are four members and two subjects. In the first and third it
is the “heart,” while in the second and fourth it is the “spirit.”

These words cannot be applied to the Christian now, inasmuch as
the old nature is not taken away, but a new nature is imparted. This is
the teaching of Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom.
4:1-25; Rom. 5:1-21; Rom. 6:1-23; Rom. 7:1-25; Rom. 8:1-39, where
in 1:16-5:11, sins are first dealt with, as the fruit of the old nature, and
then, from 5:12-8:39, sin is dealt with, as the tree which produces the
fruit: and we are taught that, though the evil fruits are still produced,
God reckons the tree itself as dead. So, though sin itself no longer
reigns, yet sins are still committed by the old nature; but the saved
sinner is to reckon that old nature, {6., himself, as having died with
Christ, and he has now a new nature.

The old nature is not taken away, as it will be in the case of Israel
in that day: so the believer has in himself one nature that cannot but
sin, and another that cannot sin (19η. 3:9; 1Jn. 5:18).

The old nature can never be improved, and the new nature needs
no improvement.
Until the believer recognises this truth he can never know peace

with God.
Heb. 1:1-14; Heb. 2:1-18 -

Α 1:1, 2-. God speaking.

В -2-14. The Son of God: “better than the angels.”

А 2:1-4. God speaking.

В 5-18. The Son of Man: “lower than the angels.”

Here the two subjects are arranged alternately. And note that B is
in a parenthesis with respect to A and A; while A is in a parenthesis
with respect to B and B. In other words, A and A read on continuously,
without reference to B, while B and B likewise read on without
reference to A, which is thus practically in a parenthesis.

Hence the word “therefore,” 2:1, is not consequent on 1:14, but on
1:2-. And the “for” in 2:5 is consequent, not on 2:4, but on 1:14. The
respective members therefore read on

Thus: (1:1) “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last
days spoken unto us by his Son ... (ii. i.) therefore we ought to give
the more earnest heed to the the things which we have heard, etc.”
And: (1:14) “Are they not all ministering (worshipping) spirits, sent
forth to minister for (to serve) them who shall be heirs of salvation?...
(2:5) for unto the angels hath he not put into subjection the world to
come, etc.”

2. Extended Alternation
This is when there are still only two series, but each series consists of
more than two members.

And these are so arranged that the first of the one series
corresponds with the first of the other; and likewise the second of the
former corresponds with the second in the latter.

This has been called by some Direct Chiasmus, reserving the term
“Indirect Chiasmus” for what we have called  Introverted
Correspondence, or Chiasmus proper.

Bengel calls this “Direct Chiasmus”: but this is contrary to the very
name of the figure: viz., the letter Chi (X.), which he says, is, as it
were, the type or mould according to which the sentence or words is
or are arranged.

We prefer to consider it merely as Alternate Correspondence in an
extended form, reserving the term Chiasmus for Introverted
Correspondence.

Correspondence.* [Note: See The Key to the Psalms. Edited by the
same author, and published by Eyre & Spottiswood.]
Psa. 132:1-18 -This Psalm affords a beautiful example of an extended
Alternation of subjects. We cannot, here, print the whole Psalm in full,
but give the following key to it:-

©С — апа knowest His will,
D and approvest the things that are more excellent
Е being instructed out of the law;
Α and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
В a light of them which are in darkness,
Can instructor of the foolish,
D_ateacher of babes,
Е which hast the form of knowledge and of the
truth of the law.”
In the first series, we have what the Jew considers as to himself. In
the second series, how he uses it in relation to others.
1Th. 1:2-10; 1Th. 2:13-16.-
А 1:2-4. The thanksgiving of Paul and his brethren.
В 5. Reason: Reception of the Gospel in the power of God.
6 6-9. The effect of the Gospel thus received.
р 10-. Believing. Thessalonians “wait” for God’s Son.
Е _ -10. Deliverance from the wrath to come.
А 2:13-. The thanksgiving of Paul and his brethren.
В -13. Reason: Reception of the Gospel in the power of God.
C 14. The effect of the Gospel thus received.
D 15, 16-. Unbelieving Jews “killed” God’s Son.
Е -Ί6. Delivered to the wrath to come.
1Th. 4:13-18; 1Th. 5:1-11.-

А 4:13. Instruction necessary as to “them which are asleep”
(κεκοιµηµένων." [Note: κοιµάομαι, to fall asleep, involuntarily:
hence used (in nearly every place) of death, but only of saints.
Mat. 27:52; Mat. 28:13. Luk. 22:45. Joh. 11:11-12. Act. 7:60;
Act. 12:6; Act. 13:36. 1Co. 7:39; 1Co. 11:30; 1Co. 15:6; 1Co.
15:18; 1Co. 15:20; 1Co. 15:51. 1Th. 4:13-15. 2Pe. 3:4.] The
Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads κοιµωµενων,
are falling asleep).

В — 14. First reason (γάρ): For, those who have fallen asleep
(κοιµηθέντας) God (by Jesus) will bring again from the

dead.

6 15. Second reason (γάρ): For, those who “are alive and
remain” (οἱ ζῶντες οἱ περιλειτόμενοι) shall not precede
them.

р 16, 17. Third reason (ὅτι): Because both will be
caught up together (ἅμα) at the Descent of the Lord
into the air.

Е 18. Encouragement: “Wherefore comfort one
another with these words.”

A 5:1. Instruction not necessary as to “the times and the
seasons” of this Resurrection and Ascension, which will take
place before the Day of the Lord.

В 2-6. First reason (yap): For they already knew that the
destruction of the wicked will mark the coming of the Day of
the Lord. Contrast (verses 4, 5) and Exhortation (verse 6):
“Therefore let us not sleep (καθεύδωµεν)Τ [Note:
éaéauaul, to go to sleep, voluntarily: hence not used of
death, but either of taking rest in sleep, or of the opposite
of watchfulness. Mat. 8:24; Mat. 9:24; Mat. 13:25; Mat.
25:5; Mat. 26:40; Mat. 26:43; Mat. 26:45. Mar. 4:27; Mar.
4:38; Mar. 5:39; Mar. 13:36; Mar. 14:37; Mar. 14:37; Mar.
14:40-41. Luk. 8:52; Luk. 22:46. Eph. 5:14. 1Th. 5:6-7;
1Th. 5:7; 1Th. 5:10.] but “let us watch” (ypnyopWpev).£
[Note: a¢eisu is translated “wake” only in verse 10, above.
Elsewhere it is always “watch,” “be watchful,” or “be
vigilant.”

Thus the marked use of zlégUlgjé in the first series, and of
éJéeyu in the second series teaches us that the hope of
Resurrection and Ascension before the Day of the Lord is
for all who are Christ's, whether they are dead or alive;
whether they are watchful or unwatchful.] (See note on
page 372).

σ 7, 8. Second reason (γάρ): “For they that sleep
(καθεύδοντες) sleep (καθεύδουσι) т the night.”
Contrast and Exhortation (verse 8).
Ю 9, 10. Third reason (ὅτι: Because God hath not
appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation (viz.,
that of the body in Resurrection) through our Lord
Jesus Christ, that whether ме watch
(venyop@pev)$ [Note: сга is translated “wake”
only in verse 10, above. Elsewhere it is always
“watch,” “be watchful,” or “be vigilant.”

Thus the marked use of éié-ibé in the first series, and
of éJéo in the second series teaches us that the
hope of Resurrection and Ascension before the Day
of the Lord is for all who are Christ's, whether they
are dead or alive; whether they are watchful or
unwatchful.] or sleep (καθεύδωµεν), we should
together (ἄμα) live with Him (as in D, above).

Ε 11. Encouragement: “Wherefore comfort
yourselves together,” etc.
2Ti. 3:16; 2Ti. 4:2.-There is a beautiful extended alternation between
the subjects of these two verses. See pages 146 and 148.
The Word of God is God-breathed and profitable for
А “doctrine,
В for reproof (or conviction),
©С for correction,
D for instruction.”
Therefore.
А “Preach the word,
В τβρΓονθ (or convict),
6 rebuke,
Р exhort,” etc.
3. Repeated Alternation
Alternate correspondence is repeated when there are more than two
series.
(a) Two members in each series
In this case the first member of the first series corresponds with the
first member of the second, third, fourth series, etc.; while the second
member of the first series corresponds with the second member of the
other series. These we have indicated as А1, Α2, A3 and B1, Β2,
B3 respectively, A corresponding with A2, A3, etc.: and B1 with B2,
B3, etc.
Psa. 26:1-12.-
А1 1-. Prayer.
В1 -1. Profession.

А2 2. Prayer.
B2 3-8. Profession.

A3 9, 10. Prayer.
B3 11-. Profession.

A4 -11. Prayer.
Β4 12. Profession.

Psa. 80:1-19.-

A1 1-3. Prayer (People).
B1 4-6. Representation (People).

Α2 7. Prayer (People).
B2 8-13. Representation (Vine).

A3 14, 15. Prayer (Vine and Vineyard).
B3 16. Representation (Vine and People).

A4 17-19. Prayer (People)

Psa. 145:1-21.-

А1 1, 2. Praise promised; from me (to Jehovah).
B1 3. Praise offered.

A2 4-7. Praise promised; from others and me (to Jehovah for His
works).
B2 8, 9. Praise offered.

A3 10-12. Praise promised; from others and works (to Jehovah for
His kingdom).
B3 13-20. Praise offered.

Α4 21. Praise promised; from me and others.

Here, in “David’s Psalm of Praise” we have seven members, with
two subjects in an extended alternation.

(b) More than two members in each series
This is a combination of Extended with Repeated Correspondence.

In this case, the first members of each series correspond with
each other; while the second member corresponds with the second,
the third with the third, etc.

Psa. 24:1-10.-Here, we have an alternation of three members
repeated in three series:

A1 1, 2. Right to the earth.

B1 3. Questions.
C1 4-6. Answer.
Α2 7. Right to heaven.
B2 8-. Question.
C2 -8. Answer.
A3 9. Right to heaven.
B3 10-. Question.
C3 -10. Answer.
Psa. 147:1-20.-
A1 1-3. Praise, and reason. (Kindness to Israel).
В1 4, 5. General operations. (Kingdom of nature).
C1 6. Contrast. (What the Lord does).
А2 7. Praise.
B2 8, 9. General operations. (Kingdom of nature).
©2 10, 11. Contrast. (What the Lord delights in).
A3 12-14. Praise, and reason. (Kindness to Israel).
B3 15-18. General operations. (Kingdom of nature).
C3 19, 20-. Contrast. (What the Lord has shown).
Α4 -20. Praise.
Il. Introverted Correspondence
This is where there are two series, and the first of the one series of
members corresponds with the /ast of the second; the second of the
first corresponds with the penultimate (or the last but one) of the
second: and the third of the first corresponds with the antepenultimate
of the second. That is to say, if there are six members, the first
corresponds with the sixth, the second with the fifth, and the third with
the fourth. And so on.

The Greeks called it CHIASMOS or CHIASTON from its likeness in
form to the letter Chi (X.). For the same reason the Latins called it
CHIASMUS, as well as DECUSSATA ORATIO from decusso, to divide
cross-wise (i.e., in the shape of an X). The Greeks called it also
ALLELOUCHIA (from ἀλλήλους (alleelous), together and ἔχειν
(echein), to have or hold, a holding or hanging together.

This is by far the most stately and dignified presentation of a
subject; and is always used in the most solemn and important portions
of the Scriptures.

Bengel observes with regard to this form of the Figure, that “its
employment is never without some use: viz., in perceiving the
ornament and in observing the force of the language; in understanding
the true and full sense; in making clear the sound Interpretation; in
demonstrating the true and neat analysis of the sacred text.”* [Note:
See The Structure of the Books of the Bible, by the same author and
publisher.]
Gen. 43:3-5.-
А Judah’s words: “The man did solemnly protest unto us, etc.”
В Jacob's act: “If thou wilt send.”
В Jacob's act: “But if thou wilt not send him.”
А Joseph’s words: “For the man said unto us, etc.”
In A and A, we have Joseph’s words; and in B and B, Jacob’s
action.
Lev. 14:51-52.-
А “And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
scarlet,
Band the living bird,
С — апа dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the
running water,
О and sprinkle the house seven times:
D And he shall cleanse the house
С with the blood of the bird, and with the running
water,
В — апа with the living bird,
А and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the
scarlet.”
Note also the figure of Polysyndeton (q.v. [Note: Which see] )
emphasizing each particular item in this ordinance.
Deu. 32:1-43 (the Song of Moses).-
А 1-6. Call to hear; and the reason. The publishing of Jehovah’s

D 20. Divine reflections on the period while Israel is
“Lo-ammi.”* [Note: Hebrew: not my people.] God’s
hiding from them (Hosea).

Е 21. Jehovah's provocation of Israel. (Period of
Acts and present dispensation).

Е 22-25. Jehovah's threatening of judgment. (The
great tribulation).

р 26-33. Divine reflections оп the period while Israel
is “Lo-ammi.”* [Note: Hebrew: not my people.]
Their scattering from God (Hosea).
©С 394-3δ. Israel’s evil return for Jehovah’s goodness.
Their helpless condition moving Him to pity. He not
forsaking them. Their rock useless. (Period of present
history).
В 99-42. The vengeance of Jehovah. (The period of the
Apocalypse).
A 43. Call to rejoice; and the reason. The publishing of
Jehovah's kingdom. Vengeance оп Israel’s enemies. Mercy on
His land and His people. (Fulfilment of the Prophets).
Psa. 23:1-6 is a simple introversion, which is marked by the use of the
persons.
Α 1-3. First and third persons: “I” and “He.”
В 4. First and second: “I” and “Thou.”
В 5. First and second: “I” and “Thou.”
Α 6. First and third: “I” and His.
Psa. 103:1-22 is a beautiful example of a large introversion of ten
members:-
А 1-5. Exhortation to bless.
В 6, 7. Gracious goodness. (Kingdom of Grace).
6 8. Merciful goodness.
D 9. Sparing goodness.
E 10. Pardoning goodness.

The Visions of Zechariah.-
А 1:1-17. False peace under the kingdom of the Gentiles.
В 1:18-21. Providential workings to break up the empires of
Dan. 2:1-49, and restore Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.
ο 2:1-13. Deliverance of the true Jerusalem out of

В 6:1-8. Providential workings to break up the kingdoms of
Dan. 7:1-28, and restore Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
А 6:9-15. True peace under the kingdom of Messiah.
Mat. 3:10-12.-

А “And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees:
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
down, and cast into the fire.

B_|indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:
©С but he that cometh after me is mightier than I,
С whose shoes | am not worthy to bear:
В He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

‚А Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,

and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the
chaff with unquenchable fire.”
Mar. 5:2-6.-
А “And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there
met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
В who had his dwelling among the tombs;
С — апа πο man could bind him ... no, not with chains:
Ώ because that he had been often bound with fetters
Е апа chains,
Е — апа the chains had been plucked asunder by
him,
Р and the fetters broken in pieces:
С neither could any man tame him.
В And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in
the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones.
А But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him.”
Joh. 5:8-11.-
А “Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
В And immediately the man was made whole,
©С And took his bed and walked;
Ю Andon the same day was the sabbath.
Р The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It
is the sabbath day.
С — И5 not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
В He answered them, He that made me whole,

Α The same said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.”

Here in A and A we have the words of Christ; in B and B the man
made whole; in C and C the bed he carried; and in D and D the
Sabbath.

Joh. 5:21-29.-We have a combined series of introverted and alternate
correspondence in these verses:-

Α 21. Concerning quickening and resurrection.

В 22, 23. Concerning judgment.
В 24. Concerning judgment.

Α 25-29. Concerning quickening and resurrection.

The last member A is alternate, and may be thus extended:-

А ο 25, 26. Concerning life and resurrection.

@а 27. Concerning judgment.
ο. 28, 29-. Concerning resurrection.
а -29. Concerning judgment.
These complex structures are not confined to Psalms or selected
passages, but pervade the whole Bible, affecting the order of the
books themselves, and the separate structure of each.

Gal. 2:16.-
А “Knowing that a man is not justified

В — Бу the works of the law,
©С but by the faith of Jesus Christ,
С even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might

be justified by the faith of Christ,

В — апа not by the works of the law: for by the works of the
law

Α shall no flesh be justified.”

The Epistle to Philemon.-
А 1-3. Epistolary
а 1,2. Names of those with Philemon.
Ь 3. Benediction.
B 4-7. Prayers of St. Paul for Philemon. Philemon’s
hospitality.
6 8. Authority.
р 9, 10-. Supplication.
Е -10. Onesimus, a convert of St. Paul's.

С 21. Authority.
В 22. Philemon’s hospitality. Prayers of Philemon for Paul.
А 23-25. Epistolary.
а 23,24. Names of those with Paul.
Ь 25. Benediction.
It will be observed that the first and last members are alternate.
Ill. Complex Correspondence
This is where the members of a structure are arranged both in
alternation (simple or extended) and in introversion, combined
together in various ways, giving the greatest possible variety and
beauty to the presentation.

Not only is this complex arrangement Of a passage complete in
itself; but very often there is a double arrangement, the one within the
other, and consistent with it, though differing from it.

And further, the longer members of any particular structure
generally contain and have their own special arrangement, and may
be severally expanded.

In some of the following examples, we have given first the general
structure of a whole book or passage and then the expansion of some
of the larger members of which it is composed.

The Ten Commandments as a whole, as well as separately, are
beautiful examples of complex structure. Take the fourth as a
specimen (Exo. 20:8-11):-

Α 8. The Sabbath-day to be kept in remembrance by man.

В а 9. The six days for man’s work.
b 10. The Seventh day for man’s rest.
В а 11-. The six days for Jehovah’s work.
Ь -11-. The seventh day for Jehovah’s rest.

Α -11. The Sabbath-day blessed and hallowed by Jehovah.“

Here, it will be noted that the first half (A and B) is concerning
man’s side and duty, and the latter half (A and B) is concerning God's
side.

Psa. 84:1-12 -
А a_ 1-4. Blessedness of the dwellers.
Ь 5-7. Blessedness of the approachers.
В 8. Prayer.
В 9. Prayer.

A а 10. Blessedness of the dwellers. (“For.”)

Ь 11, 12. Blessedness of the approachers. (“For.”)

This Psalm is a simple introversion of four members, but the first
member, “a,” while it thus forms part of a larger member is itself
constructed as an extended introversion, which helps to the
understanding of verses 1-4.

а ο 1. “Thy tabernacles.”

@ 2. Desire for the courts of the Lord.
е — 3-. As the sparrow.
е — -3-. As the swallow.
@ -3. Desire for the altars of the Lord.
c 4. “Thy house.”
The two members d and d read on connectedly thus: “My soul
longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my
flesh crieth out for the living God ... even thine altars, O Lord of hosts,
my King and my God.”

Thus we are prevented from supposing that birds could build nests

in the altar of burnt offerings, on which fires were always burning, and
which was overlaid with brass; or in the altar of incense, which was
within the Holy Place, and overlaid with gold! (see page 96).
Psa. 49:1-20. is perhaps one of the most striking examples of
Complex Correspondence which the Scriptures afford. The Psalm, as
a whole, is alternate, with a Thema, or general subject. The first and
third members are arranged as an introversion; while in each of the
four members of which it is composed, a couplet is answered by a
quatrain, and a quatrain by a couplet.

The Thema, or Subject, anticipates the double form of the Psalm
itself. It is in two quatrains: (1) All people to hear (2) | will speak. The
first two lines of each quatrain are broken up and arranged alternately,
while the second two lines of each quatrain are introverted:

(1) All People to hear.
$  1-. “Hear this
# — -1-. All ye people,
$ -1-. Give ear,
@{ -1. All ye inhabitants of the world.
и — 2-. Low
м — -2-. and high.
у -2-. rich
и — -2. and poor.”
(2) | will speak.
м — 3-. “My mouth shall speak
x -ᾱ- of wisdom,
w_ -3-. and the meditation of my heart shall be
х -3. of understanding.
у — 4-. | will incline mine ear
# -4-. to a parable;
# -4-. | will open my dark saying
у -4. upon the harp.”
Then comes the Psalm proper:
The Psalm itself.
A а 5. Why fear? (couplet).
b 6-9. No redemption for the worldly (quatrain,
alternate).
ο — 10-. Death (couplet).
4 -10, 11. Worldly wisdom (quatrain, introverted).
В — 12. Man compared to beasts (couplet).
A а — 13. Worldly wisdom (couplet).
ο. 14. Death (quatrain, introverted).
b — 15. Redemption for me (couplet).
а 16-19. Fear not (quatrain, alternate).
В 20. Man compared to beasts (couplet).

Here note that, as in other cases, the corresponding members
(which are marked by the same letters) may be read on, the one being
explanatory of the other: the question in “a” (“Why fear?”) being
answered in a (“Fear not, etc.”)

Psa. 105:1-45. affords another beautiful example, but we can give
only the key to it.

Α 1-7. Exhortation to praise the Lord (second person, plural).

В 8-12. Basis of praise, God’s covenant with Abraham, in
promise.
С а 13. The journeyings of the Patriarchs.
Ь — 14, 15. Their favour and protection.
ο 16. Their affliction.
@ 17-22. Mission of Joseph to deliver.
С a _ 23. The journeyings of the People.
Ь 24. Their favour and protection.
ο. 25. Their affliction.
d 26-41. Mission of Moses to deliver.
В 42-45-. Basis of praise. God’s covenant with Abraham, in
performance.
А -45. Exhortation to praise the Lord (second person, plural).
Here, the Psalm as a whole is an introversion, while the two
central members are placed in strong correspondence by an extended
alternate arrangement; in which we have in the first (C) the history of
the Patriarchs (Genesis), and in the second (C) the history of the
Nation (Exodus).
Note also that while A and A are in the second person plural, all
the rest of the Psalm is in the third person.
Note further that the two longer members B and B are similarly
constructed, and the subjects repeated by extended alternation (as in
С and C), thus:-
В е 8-10. The Covenant remembered.
f 11. The Land promised.
9 — 12. The People described.
В е 42, 43. The Covenant remembered.
f 44. The Land inherited.
9 45. The People described.
In like manner the two longer members d and d may be shown to
have the same wonderful structure.
Я ἩἹ 17. The sending of the deliverer.
i 18, 19. His trial by the word.
κ 20-22. The deliverance.
а ΠΠ 26. The sending of the deliverers.
i 27-36. Egypt's trial by the word (see verse 27, margin).
к 37-41. The deliverance.
Psa. 146:1-10 :.-This Psalm affords another beautiful example of the
combined correspondence. As a whole the Psalm is an Introversion;
while the inner members consist of an extended alternation:-
A 1, 2. Praise. Hallelujah.
В а — 3-. Wrong trust, in man.
Ь -3. Man powerless.
ο — 4. Man perishable.
В а 5. Right trust, in God.
Ь 6-9. God all-powerful,
с — 10-. God eternal.
А -10. Praise. Hallelujah.
Psa. 148:1-14.-
А 1-. Hallelujah.
В а -1. Praise from the heavens (second person).
Ь 2-4. Enumeration of heavenly things.
ο 5-. Injunction to praise (third person).
@ -5, 6. Inducements: (“for”).
В а 7-. Praise from the earth (second person).
Ь — -7-12. Enumeration of earthly things.
с — 13-. Injunction to praise (third person).
а -13, 14-. Inducements: (“for”).
А -14. Hallelujah.
Here, again, while the whole Psalm is introverted, the two centre
members are arranged as an extended alternation.
Mar. 3:21-35.-
A а 21-. His kindred. “His friends” (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]
kinsmen).
Ь — -21-. Their interference. “Went out.”
ο  -21. Their disparagement of Him. “For they said,
etc.”
ва 22-. The Scribes: Their first charge, “He
hath.”
е -22, Their second charge, “He casteth
out.”
B e 23-27. His answer to the second
charge.
d 28-30. His denunciation of the first charge.
A а 31-. His kindred. “There came then his, etc.”
Ь — -31, 32. Their interference. “Sent, calling.”
ο 33-35. His disparagement of them.
From this beautiful complex structure, we learn that, as “d”
corresponds with “d,” the sin against the Holy Ghost is the saying that
Christ was possessed by a devil! And also, from the correspondence
of “b,” with “b” we learn that the interference of the mother and
brethren of Christ was because they said He was “beside Himself.” No
wonder then that their disparagement of Him (in “с”) is answered by
His disparagement of them (in “с”).

We give examples of the Seven Epistles addressed by the Holy
Spirit through St. Paul to the Churches: but for the fuller development
of them we must refer the reader to our larger work on this great and
important subject.* [Note: What is the Spirit saying to the Churches?
See a series of articles commenced in Things to Come, Sept., 1898.]

d 30-33. Prayer, etc. (theirs for him).
с 16:1-24. Salutation.
The whole of this epistle is marvellously constructed, and the
construction is absolutely essential to its correct interpretation.

It is hardly the design of this work to go too deeply into these
structures; but the doctrinal portion (a |1:16-8:39) is too important to
be passed over.

It is divided into two parts. The first deals with the old nature, and
with the fruits of the old tree. The second deals with the tree itself, and
the conflict between the two natures in the believer.

C. Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom. 4:1-25; Rom.

5:1-21; Rom. 6:1-23; Rom. 7:1-25; Rom. 8:1-39.
Doctrine.

It is of the greatest importance to note that the break occurs at the
end of chapter 5:11.

Up to that point the question dealt with is “sins.” From that point it
is “sin.” And, unless this great distinction be made the doctrine cannot
be understood. The two parts, then, stand, as follows:-

а Ὁ 1:16-5:11. SINS. The products of old nature. The fruits of

the old tree.
E 5:12-8:39. SIN. The old nature. The old tree itself
The First Division, D (1:16-5:11). SINS.
The old nature and its fruits.

О а 1:16, 17. The power of God unto salvation to every one
that believeth God’s Gospel revealing a righteousness from
God.

h 1:18. The wrath of God revealed against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness.

h 1:19-3:20. The wrath of God revealed against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness.

9 — 3:21-5:11. The power of God unto salvation to every one
that believeth God’s Gospel revealing a righteousness from
God.

The Second Division, E (5:12-8:39). SIN.

The old nature itself, and its conflict with the new nature.

E i 5:12-21. Condemnation to death through a single sin of
one man (τὸ παράπτωμα): but justification of life through a
single righteous act of one man (τὸ δικαίωμα).

К 6:1-7:6. We are not in sin, having died in Christ.
κ. 7:7-25. Sin is in us, though we are alive in Christ.
i 8:1-39. Condemnation of sin in the flesh, but now “ΝΟ
condemnation” to us who are alive unto God in Christ
Jesus and in whom is Christ.

these are so arranged that the shorter prayer corresponds with the
longer prayer, and the longer thanksgiving with the shorter
thanksgiving, and so with the other members.* [Note: For the structure
of particular portions of these Epistles, and expansions of the various
members, see the series of articles commencing in Things to Come
for Sept., 1898.]

We add the structure of the two Epistles of St. Peter:-

members. While B and B are a simple alternation, and C and C an
extended alternation, with which another inner introversion is
combined.
