Exo. 19:6.-“A kingdom of priests”: i.e., a royal priesthood. In 1Pe. 2:9,
this is put literally, instead of (as here) by Antiptosis.

Psa. 1:1.-“O the blessedness or happinesses of the man”: i.e., the
happy or blessed man.

Mat. 13:5.-“No depth of earth”: /.e., no deep earth.

Luk. 1:48.-“The low estate of his handmaiden”: i.e., his humiliated
bondmaid: referring to the humiliation to which she had to be subject.
If even Joseph could suspect her, however sorrowfully and sadly, what
would others do? What, in fact, in Jewish teaching still!

Luk. 5:9.-“At the haul of the fish”: i.e., the fish of the capture; or, the
captured fishes.

Rom. 2:4.-“The good thing (τὸ χρηστόν, to chreeston) of God”: i.e.,
the goodness of God. See under Antimereia of the adjective.

Rom. 5:17.-“The abundance of the grace”: i.e., the abounding grace.
1Co. 1:17.-“Not with wisdom of speech”: i.e., not with learned or
eloquent language.

1Со. 1:21.-“The folly of preaching”: i.e., foolish (as the wise Gentiles
ironically called it) preaching.

1Со. 14:12.-"So do ye also, since as ye are zealous of spirits.” Here,
the noun “spirits” is used for the adjective spiritual (πνευμάτων,
рпеитайфл for πνευματικῶν, pneumatikebn). Both the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] insert the word “gifts” in
italics. See under Metonymy.

2Co. 8:8.-“The genuineness of your love”: i.e., your genuine love.

Gal. 3:14.-‘The promise of the Spirit’: i.e., the promised Spirit.
Gal. 4:4.-“The fulness of the time”: {6., the full or completed time.
Eph. 1:7.-“The riches of his grace.” By Enallage this would be
gracious riches, but it means more than this. Grace is the subject, and
it is the exceeding wealth of this wondrous grace which has abounded
toward those who are “accepted in the Beloved.”

By Antiptosis the one is put for the other, and the noun “riches” is
put for the adjective: i.e., His exceeding rich grace. So also
Eph. 1:18.-“The riches of his glory’ denotes the exceeding rich glory
of His inheritance in the saints.
Eph. 4:29.-“Building up or edifying of the need.” The A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
renders this-“Use of edifying;” but it is the word “use” (or need) which
is in the genitive case, and not the word “edifying.” The R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “Edifying as the need may be.”

But by the figure of Antiptosis (which neither Version perceived),
the former noun is used for the adjective, instead of the latter in the
genitive case.

The meaning, therefore, is “that which is good for edifying use.”
Php. 4:5.-“The immutability of his counsel”: i.e., his immutable
counsel.
Col. 1:27.-“The riches of the glory”: i.e., His wondrously rich glory, in
the mystery revealed to and through Paul.
1Th. 1:3.-“Work of faith,” “labour of love,” and “patience of hope.”

We have given these under the genitive of origin (see Appendix B):
i.e., work which proceeds from faith, labour which proceeds from love,
and patience that proceeds from hope.

The genitive, however, may be, by Antimereia, faithful service,
loving labour, and hopeful patience.

But, if the figure is Antiptosis, then it means a working faith (i.e., a
faith which is manifested by its works), a laborious love, and patient
hope. Probably all three interpretations are correct!

Heb. 6:17.-“The immutability of his counsel”: i.e., His unchangeable
counsel.”

Heb. 9:15.-“The promise of the eternal inheritance”: {6., the promised
eternal inheritance.

1Pe. 3:20.-“The longsuffering of God”: i.e., the longsuffering God.

There are other exchanges of case beside that of the absolute for
the construct. But these are for the most part peculiar to Greek usage.
Luk. 1:55.-“As he spake to (πρός) our fathers, to Abraham (τῷ
Αβραάμ), and to his seed (τῷ).” Here, the fathers is in the Accusative
because more general; while Abraham, etc, is in the Dative, because
more personal
Heb. 10:5.-“A body hast thou prepared me (Dat. μοί (moi), for me).”

It is a question whether the Dative is used, by Antiptosis, for the

Accusative; to show that, while Christ’s human body was prepared for
Him, yet He was also constituted a servant for ever according to Exo.
21:6 and Deu. 15:17. This is the sense in Psa. 40:6 (7), and σῶμα
(sqma), body, was used of slaves (Rev. 18:13), just as we use
“hands” of labourers.
Rev. 1:5-6.-“And from Jesus Christ (Gen. [Νοίε: en. The Genitive
Case_] ), the faithful witness (Nom. [Note: om. The Nominative Case.]
), and the first begotten (Nom. [Note: om. The Nominative Case.] )
from the dead ... to him (Dat.) that loved us ... and made us (Nom.
[Note: om. The Nominative Case.] ) kings, etc., to him (Dat.).” All this
change of cases seems to overwhelm us with the idea of the
impossibility of expressing the praise and glory which should be
ascribed to Jesus Christ.
