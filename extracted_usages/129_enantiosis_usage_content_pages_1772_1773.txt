E-nan-ti-o??-sis. Greek, 211 from ©' | | (enantios), opposite.
The figure Antithesis is called Enantiosis when the contrast is
expressed by affirmatives and negatives. What is stated affirmatively
is meant negatively, or vice versa. When it is stated both ways, it is a
kind of Pleonasm (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ). The difference being that
Pleonasm refers to any statement, while Enantiosis refers to
affirmation by contraries.

Psa. 1:1.-We have here a beautiful series of affirmation by contraries.

whereby we cry, “Abba, Father.”

Php. 3:9.-“And be found in him (Christ), not having mine own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that [righteousness] which is
through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”
