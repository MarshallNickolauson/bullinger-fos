Gen. 6:17.-“And, behold, I, even, I, do bring a flood of waters upon
the earth.”
Gen. 7:19.-“And the waters prevailed exceedingly.”

Here, as in other passages, the doubled adverb is used for a
superlative. ira ira (тефа, тефа), greatly, greatly. We have the
same words in 17:2, “And | will multiply thee exceedingly (тефа,
тефа). So also verse 6, exceeding; and verse 20, exceedingly;
30:43, “And the man increased exceedingly (тефа, тефа)”; Exo.
1:7, “Waxed exceeding”; Num. 14:7, “It is an exceeding (тефа,
ππεφα)) good land”; 1К!. 7:47, “Because they were exceeding (тефа,
тефа) many”; 2Ki. 10:4, “But they were exceedingly (тефа, тефа)
afraid”; Eze. 9:9, “And Judah is exceeding (тефа, тефа) great”;
16:13, “And thou wast exceeding (med, тефа) beautiful’; 37:10,
“An exceeding (тефа, meqbd) great army.”

Gen. 22:11.-“And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven,
and said, Abraham, Abraham.”

This is the first occurrence of this figure, used of names. There are
ten such in the Scriptures (the number ten completing the cycle of
Divine order).* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author
and publisher.]
Seven of these are used by God to man (four of which are in the
Old Testament, and three in the New), the other three being used
under other circumstances. When thus used, the figure calls special
attention to the occasion or to the person, and to some solemn
moment of importance in the action, or of significance in the words.

Used by God to men. (7)
Old Test. (4)

1. Abraham, Abraham (Gen. 22:11).

2. Jacob, Jacob (Gen. 46:2).

3. Moses, Moses (Exo. 3:4).

4. Samuel, Samuel (1Sa. 3:10).

New Test. (3)
5. Martha, Martha (Luk. 10:41).
6. Simon, Simont [Note: “Satan hath desired to have you (Usd,
plural) that he may sift you (Usd, plural) as wheat: but | have
prayed for thee (10 singular) that thy faith fail not.”
Satan “sifts” to get rid of the wheat! Christ “fans” to get rid of the
chaff (Mat. 3:12).] (Luk. 22:31).
7. Saul, Saul (Act. 9:4).
Used under other circumstances.} [Note: Each of these three
examples is unique. In No. 8 it is the name of the Lord used by
man. In No. 9 it is used of God's city and people by Christ. In
No. 10 it is used of God by Christ.] (3)
8. Lord, Lord (Mat. 7:21-22. Luk. 6:46; Luk. 13:25).
9. Jerusalem, Jerusalem (Mat. 23:37. Luk. 13:34).
10. Eloi, Eloi (Mar. 15:34. Mat. 27:46. Psa. 22:1).
It is to be noted that in raising the dead the Lord Jesus never used
this figure! As much as to say it needed no emphasis whatever to
make the dead hear His voice (see Mar. 5:41).

The disciples may cry, “Master, Master, we perish!” (Luk. 8:24),
but He calmly rebukes the winds and the waves.

Gen. 25:30.-“And Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me, | pray thee, with that
same red pottage.”

The Hebrew having no superlative, doubles the adjective (see
under /diom), afai arai (hah-ahdom, hah-ahdom), red, red, ie.,
this very red [food]; or, this deliciously red food.

Exo. 2:12.-“And he looked this way and that way.”

Here the Hebrew GA [65 (ΚΦΗ ναΗΚΦΗ), this and this, is well
translated, The repetition emphasizes the fact that he looked in every
direction. See also Jos. 8:20, i.e., in any direction. 2Ki. 2:8. Also Jos.
8:33, 1Са ПСа (mizzeh oomizzeh), i-e., on all sides. 1Ki. 2:36, “Go
not forth thence any-whither” fda lfda (ahneh vah-ah-nah), this
and this. 2Ki. 4:35, see margin.
Exo. 4:16.-“And he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a
mouth:” i.e., he shall surely be, etc.
Exo. 15:16.-“Till thy people pass over, О Lord, till the people pass
over, which thou hast purchased:” i.e., till thy people have completely
passed over and are safe on the other side.
Exo. 23:30.-“By little and little | will drive them out from before thee,”
IAS IAS (me-at, me-at), “little, little, | will drive, etc.:” ie., | will drive
them out by very slow degrees. There s no “by” or “and” in the Hebrew
of this passage. These words should be in italics. The figure is
beautifully rendered in English idiom, where two adverbs are used to
express the superlative.
Exo. 28:34.-“A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
pomegranate upon the hem of the robe round about:” /.е., alternately.
Exo. 34:6.-“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed,
JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH.”

Here, if we were to translate the figure idiomatically, it means that
He proclaimed the wonderful name, Jehovah! (which He did in the
sixth and seventh verses).
Lev. 6:12 (5).-“And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning.”
aa-f aa-t (babbopker, babbabker), morning, morning: i.e., every
morning, regularly, and without intermission.

Lev. 24:8.-“Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord
continually.”

Hebrew aéli Δὐάή aéli auau (Веуфт hashabbath beyom

hashabbath), on-the-day-of the-Sabbath, on-the-day-of the-
Sabbath: i.e., every Sabbath, with emphasis on the word “every,” i.e.,
every Sabbath without fail.
Num. 17:12-13 (27, 28).-After Aaron’s rod had been brought forth, the
people were frightened and cried to Moses, “Behold, we die, we
perish, we all perish. Whosoever cometh near, cometh near unto
the tabernacle of the Lord shall die: shall we be consumed with
dying?”

Here the figure is a-Fa a-fa (hakkahrev hakkahrev), cometh
near, cometh near. It is idiomatically translated by the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , but
literally by the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

There is also the repetition of the word faadl ‘(ahvadnoo), “we
perish, we all perish.”

Deu. 28:43.-Here the figure is really translated idiomatically, and not
literally. “The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
high,” ie. INGA TAGA (mahalah, mahalah), high, high; “and thou
shalt come down very low” ({6., 168 iéa (mattah, mattah), low,
low).
Thus the figure emphasizes the depth of the misery into which
Israel should be brought if they would not hearken to the voice of
Jehovah (verse 15).

Jdg. 5:22.-

“Then did the horsehoofs stamp:

By reason of the pransings, the pransings of his mighty

ones.”

таайи AaarlU (middaharoth daharoth), ie. the violent
pransings, if translated idiomatically. See under /diom.
1Sa. 2:3.-‘Talk no more exceeding proudly.”

aaaa aaaa (gevohah, gevohah), proudly, proudly, ie.,
arrogantly or haughtily.

Here the repeated adjective is idiomatically translated as a
superlative.
2Sa. 7:5.-“Go and tell my servant David (Heb., to my servant, to
David), Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build, me a house for me to
dwell in?”
Here there is great emphasis to be placed on the repeated
pronoun, “me,” in order to rebuke the popular and universal thought of
the natural heart, which ever says, “See now, | dwell in a house of
cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.”
2Sa. 18:33.-“O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would
God | had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!”

Here the figure emphasizes the vehemence of David's grief.
2Ki. 4:19.-"And he said unto his father, My head, my head.” (//UG
rrué, roshee, roshee.)

How eloquent: and what a volume is contained in this simple
figure, so naturally used by the child; as an English child would say,
“My poor head.”
2Ch. 4:3.-“Compassing the sea round about.” naéa naéa
(sahveev, sahveev), around, around: i.e., completely round, all
around. The same repetition is used, to express complete
surrounding, in Eze. 37:2; Eze. 40:5; Eze. 40:14; Eze. 40:16 (twice),
17, 25, 29, 30, 33, 36, 43; 41:5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16 (the second
“round about”), 17, 19; 42:15, 20; 43:12. In all these descriptions of
the new and future Temple, the repetition of naéa naéa (sahveev,
sahveev) emphasizes the completeness of the measurements.

Psa. 22:1.-"My God, my God (/G6 [66, Elee, Elee), why hast thou
forsaken me?”

Who can tell the depth of meaning and of feeling, which this figure
here reveals? It is thus impressed upon us, because it cannot be
expressed by words. See Mar. 15:34.

Psa. 67:6-7 (7, 8).-

“God shall bless us,

God shall bless us:”
i.e., God shall really and truly bless us in very deed.
Psa. 77:16 (17).-

“The waters saw thee, O God,

The waters saw thee.”

(See under Prosopopoeia.) Thus emphatically describing Exo.
14:1-31
Psa. 96:13.-
“For He cometh, for He cometh:”

i.e., for He shall surely come.
Psa. 118:11.-Twice “They compassed me about’; and in verses 15
and 16, we have three times “The right hand of the Lord.”
Psa. 137:7.-“Remember, О Lord, the children of Edom in the day of
Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof,”
ie, nrl-nrl ‘(ahroo, ahroo), “Down-with-it, down-with-it,” or we might
render the figure, utterly overthrow it.
Pro. 20:14.-“It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
gone his way, then he boasteth.”

Heb. is m im (ra, ra), i.e., “very bad,” or “worth nothing.” What a
picture of Eastern bargaining!
Ecc. 3:18.-Lit., | said in my heart respecting the estate of the sons of
men that ... they, even they are like beasts.”

Here the figure of Pleonasm (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) first
emphasizes the word “men,” and then the Epizeuxis again increases
that emphasis.
Ecc. 7:24.-“That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it
out?”

hi- hi- (ahmok, ahmok), deep, deep: i.e., as it is translated,
“exceeding deep.”
Isa. 6:3.-The holiness of Jehovah is emphasized beyond measure,
and the three persons in one God are indicated by the thrice repeated
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.” Here the highest degree of
holiness is ascribed to Jehovah.

Isa. 21:9.-“Babylon is fallen, is fallen’: to emphasize the certainty
and the greatness of the fall of that great city, and the completeness of
its final overthrow. See also Rev. 18:2.

Isa. 26:3.-“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace.”

Here the figure is idiomatically translated. The Hebrew reads (see
margin) uéli uéli (shalom, shalom), peace, peace, thus
emphasizing the word and denoting much peace, great peace; or, as
in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “perfect peace.” In 57:19 and Jer. 6:14 it is not thus
translated.

Professor Driver mentions this duplication of words as being a
post-Isaian feature of literary style (/ntroduction to the Literature of the
Old Testament, pp. 233, 234). He says, “The literary style of chapters
40-56 is very different from that of Isaiah”: one of the “literary features”
being the repetition of words. It is remarkable, as being characteristic
of the wisdom and acumen assumed by the higher critics, that though
Professor Driver mentions the repetition of uéli Uéli, peace, peace,
in Isa. 57:19, he does not mention the very same repetition in 26:3:
which is an evidence of the very unity of the two parts of Isaiah which
he is seeking to disprove.* [Note: The same applies to other
arguments: e.g., Dr. Driver says (p.227) that certain words “occurring
in chapters 40-66. point to a later period of language than Isaiah’s age
... A remarkable instance is afforded by 65:25 ... where écal, the
common Hebrew word for together, is replaced by éf¢a, an
expression modelled upon the Aramaic écar, and occurring besides
only in the latest books of the Old Testament.” But Professor Driver
does not mention the fact that the word occurs in the earlier books of
the Bible: so early indeed as Gen. 3:22; Gen. 49:16. 1Sa. 17:36, and
elsewhere. True, in these passages it is in the construct state: but that
makes no difference so far as the argument is concerned. Moreover,
as this very word écal occurs in chap. 1:28, 31, and 11:6, 7, as well
as in 66:17, it is an argument against Dr. Driver's division of Isaiah into
two halves.]

Isa. 28:10.-This is probably the ironical language of the “scornful men”
(verse 14), introduced by the Ellipsis of verse 9: “Whom [say they]
shall he teach knowledge’?... for [it is] precept upon precept; precept
upon precept; line upon line; line upon line; here a little, and there
a little.” And, then, the Prophet retorts: “For (or Yea, verily) with
stammering lips (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , stammerings of lips) and
another tongue will he speak (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , he hath
spoken) to this people.”

In the English the Epizeuxis is not perfect, because the word
“upon” comes between, but in the Hebrew the words follow each other
closely.

6! 66] δἱ 6] -| ὅ-| -ἰ 6-1

cneér bi cher of
Le., “For it is tzav latzav; tzav latzav; kav lakav, kav lakav; z3hr shehm,
zshr shehm.”

See also verse 13.

Isa. 40:1.-“Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.” Here
the Epizeuxis consists of one word in the Hebrew, dcil- dcil-
(nachmoo, nachmoo): and calls our attention to the passage; while it
emphasizes the plenitude of that comfort wherewith Jehovah has
determined to comfort His People Israel at no distant date.
Isa. 51:1-23.-In this Scripture we have three calls emphasized by this
figure.
А1 51:9-11. A call to the arm of Jehovah:-“Awake, awake, put on
strength, O arm of the Lord.”
B1 12-16. Followed by comfort.
A2 17-20. A call to Jerusalem:-“Awake, awake, stand up, O
Jerusalem.”
B2 21-23. Followed by comfort.
A3 52:1, 2. A call to Zion:-“Awake, awake, put on strength, O
Zion.”
B3 3-12. Followed by comfort.
Isa. 57:19.-“I create the fruit of the lips:-Peace, peace to him that is
far off and to him that is near,” etc.: {6., great peace, perfect peace as
in 26:3 (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]).
Jer. 4:19.-“My bowels, my bowels!” to emphasize the great distress
experienced.
Jer. 6:14.-“They have healed also the hurt of the daughter* [Note:
These words are supplied, apparently from chap. 8:11, 21.] of my
people slightly, saying Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” Here
the figure contrasts with the fact that there was no peace for
Jerusalem the fact that her false prophets continually promised plenty
of peace, much peace.
Jer. 22:29.-“O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.”
Eze. 21:9-13 (Hebrews 14-18).-“A sword, a sword is sharpened, and
also furbished.”

This is to call our attention to “the sword of the Lord,” viz., Babylon,
and to show that His sword is a sword for war, and not a sword worn
for honour. This is the key to this difficult passage. That there are
difficulties is seen the moment we observe the italics, note the
marginal alternatives, and consult the commentators!

Jehovah’s sword was not like the sword of His son Judah, not like
his “rod” or “sceptre” (verse 10), which was merely for honour, and
was no use against a tree. But this sword (verse 10) “contemneth the
rod (or sceptre) of my son, as [it despiseth] every tree (or wood).”
Verse 12 should be, “Cry and howl, son of man: for it sha// be upon my
people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: my people shall be
delivered to the sword: smite therefore upon thy thigh” (which was the
symbol of fear in man, as beating the breast was in woman). Verse 13.
“Because it was proved, and what? (i.e., what will happen? what will
be the result?) if the sword shall not despise the wood, saith the Lord!
It will not be, saith Adonai Jehovah!” (i.e., it will not despise it! it will
destroy it!)

Thus we have the sword of Jehovah emphasized: and the
structure of these verses explains their meaning.
А 8-10. The sword of Jehovah (Babylon). Its sharpness and
brightness.
В — -10. Its contempt for the rod or sceptre of His son Judah.

А 11, 12. The sword of Jehovah. Its destroying power.

В 19. Its contempt for the wooden rod or sceptre of Judah.

The point is that the sword of the Lord is a sword of war, not of
honour; and its power is so great that the sceptre of Judah (which was
of wood) will not withstand it.

Eze. 21:27.-‘I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no
more until he come whose right it is; and | will give it him”: {98., | will
completely and thoroughly overturn it.

The threefold Epizeuxis emphasizes the completeness of the
overthrow of the throne of David; hence, by implication, the certainty
of the promised fulfilment of the prophecy that He who is David’s Son
and David’s Lord, shall surely reign upon that same throne according
to Luk. 1:32-33, and many other Scriptures.

Eze. 22:2.-“Wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge?”: i.e., Wilt thou really
and truly judge? See under Heterosis.

Eze. 33:11.-“Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways.”

Eze. 34:11.-“Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep and seek
them out.”
And verse 20: “Behold I, even, I, will judge between the fat cattle
and between the lean cattle.”
Thus does Adonai Jehovah emphasize what He will do in
consequence of the unfaithfulness of the shepherds, who fed not His
flock, but fed themselves. (See under Ellipsis, page 114).

Eze. 34:17.-‘I judge between cattle and cattle.” (da 6a)

For the emphasis in this passage, see the notes on it under the
figure of Ellipsis (page 40).

Dan. 5:11.-“Whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, /
say, thy father, made master of the magicians”: i.e., thy father the
great and mighty king Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan. 10:19.-“Be strong, yea, be strong:” i.e., be very strong.

Zep. 1:14.-“The great day of the Lord is near, is near, and hasteth
greatly”: /.e., is very near.

Mat. 5:37.-“But let your communication (R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , speech) be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.”

Here the figure emphasizes the fact, not that we are forbidden to
say, “Yea” or “nay” twice; but that we are merely to say, “Yes” or “no,”
and not to indulge in vehement asseverations and oaths; “for
whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.”

Mat. 23:37.-“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,”
etc.: emphasizing the pathetic appeal by the exceeding guilt of the city
in killing the prophets of Jehovah.

Luk. 23:21.-“Crucify him, crucify him,” emphasizing the vehemence
of the cry, and the determination of the priest-led people.

Joh. 1:51.-“Verily, verily, | say unto you.” ἁμὴν, ἁμήν (ameen
ameen). Twenty-five solemn sayings of the Lord Jesus are thus
emphatically marked in John’s Gospel: viz., 1:51; 3:3, 5, 11; 5:19, 24,
25; 6:26, 32, 47, 53; 8:34, 51, 58; 10:1, 7; 12:24; 13:16, 20, 21, 38;
14:12; 16:20, 23; 21:18. It might prove a useful study to trace the
sequence of truth in these successive statements.

Apart from the Repetition, which occurs only in the fourth Gospel,
there is something to be learnt from the number of times the word
occurs.* [Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author and
publisher.]

Heb. 10:37.-“Yet a little while,” Lit., how little, how little.” Greek: ἔτι
yap μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον (eti gar mikron hoson hoson).

Eph. 3:9.-Lit. “And to enlighten all [as to] what [is] the dispensation of
the Mystery which has been hidden away, away, from the ages in [or
by] God.” Showing the completeness with which the secret was hidden
in former times. Compare Rom. 16:25, and Col. 1:26.
