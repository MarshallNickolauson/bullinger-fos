Euche; or, Prayer
An Expression of Feeling by way of Prayer, Curse, or Imprecation
Eu’-chee. Greek, εὐχή, а prayer, wish, or vow. Latin VOTUM.

This includes a prayer, or wish; also a prayer for evil; hence curse,
imprecation.

This figure is a change by which a statement is expressed as a
prayer, instead of as a matter of fact. And where the prayer comes in
by way of parenthesis caused by the sudden change.

Its use arises from and betokens an excited Condition of feeling.

The Scriptures abound with examples of all kinds, which may be
sought out and studied for instruction and example.

See Deu. 28:67. Isa. 64:1-2 (63:19; 64:1). Act. 26:29. Rom. 9:3.

The subject to which this figure introduces us may be treated of
quite separately: as the prayer may be introduced as an ejaculation,
as a parenthesis, or as an addition or conclusion, etc.
Psa. 118:25.-“Save now, | beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, | beseech
thee, send now prosperity.”
Partneticon; or, Exhortation
An Expression of Feeling by way of Exhortation

Par’-ce-net’-i-con. Greek, παραινετικός, hortatory, from παραινέω
(рагатеб), to recommend, advise, exhort.

This figure is employed when a direct statement is changed, and
put into the form of exhortation.

The Scriptures abound with examples, which the reader may
easily find and note for himself.
