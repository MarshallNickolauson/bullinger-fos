It is called PARRHESIA (Par-rhee’-si-a). Greek, παρρησία, free
spokenness, openness, boldness, frankness.

The Latins called it LICENTIA, licence.

The words of Elihu (Job. 32:1-22 -xxxvii.) are a beautiful example
of this figure.
Luk. 13:32.-“Go ye, and tell that fox,” was a very frank and fearless
message to Herod.
Joh. 8:44.-“Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in
the truth, because there is no truth in him.” etc.

See under /diom and Metonymy.
1Jn. 3:10.-“In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
the devil.”

This is free-speaking indeed; too free for the false toleration and
charity-mongering of the present day; but these are the words of the
God of love, through John the apostle of love.
The following places where the word Parrhesia is used in the New
Testament will furnish many interesting examples.
