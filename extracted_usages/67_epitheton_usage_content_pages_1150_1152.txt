Gen. 21:16.-“And she (Hagar) went, and sat her down over against
him, a good way off, as it were a bowshot”: the bowshot being an
Epithet for a certain distance.
Exo. 25:25; Exo. 37:12. 1Ki. 7:26. 2Ch. 4:5. Psa. 39:5. Eze. 40:5.-An
hand-breadth is used as an Epithet for a certain thickness.
Num. 24:20.-“And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable,
and said,

Amalek was the first of the nations,

But his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.”
The last phrase “he perish” is an epithet, the result of the war
which Jehovah would wage with him. The marginal reading shows the
difficulty felt by the translators. Literally it is

“The first of the nations is Amalek,

And his end-for ever he perisheth”: i.e.
“The first of the nations is Amalek,

And his end is destruction.”

For Amalek was the first who fought against Israel (Exo. 17:8), and
Jehovah will fight against Amalek to the end (Exo. 17:16).

We may compare Amo. 6:1.

Jdg. 20:16.-A “hair-breadth” is used as an epithet of a minute width.
See Hyperbole.

Joh. 17:3.-“That they might know thee, the only true God.” Here “true”
is not a mere adjective qualifying God, but is an epithet: “That they
might know Thee-God, the only God, the true (or very) God.” So 1Jn.
5:20. 1Th. 1:9.

Such epithets are used of God, not to qualify but to distinguish Him
from them who are no gods. See Gal. 4:8. 1Co. 8:5-6.

Luk. 22:41.-A “stone’s-throw’ is used as an epithet of a certain
distance.
1Pe. 4:3.-“Abominable idolatries’-abominable things: i.e., the worship
of idols.
