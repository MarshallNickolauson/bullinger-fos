complete without it, but not as to clearness and sense.

A true Parenthesis is not complete without the context. When it is,
it is called Parembole. (See below.)

Parentheses are for the most part indicated; but there are others
which are not marked.

Heb. 2:9.-“But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the
angels

(for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour);
that He, by the grace of God, should taste death for every* [Note: l.e.,
without distinction, not without exception.] man.”

This shows that the Lord was made a little lower than the angels in
order that He might die. And that he was crowned with glory and
honour on account of His sufferings.t [Note: See Christ's Prophetic
Teaching, by the same author and publisher.]
2Pe. 1:19.-“We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed (as unto a light that shineth in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise) in your hearts.”
Here, it is clear that there must be a parenthesis, for it is prophecy
that is the light that shines, and Christ and His appearing are the Day-
star and the Day-dawn. Surely, the meaning cannot be that we are
exhorted to take heed to the prophetic word until Christ is revealed in
our hearts! No; but we are to take heed in our hearts to this prophetic
word, until the fulfilment comes in the appearing of Christ-the rising of
Him who is called “the Morning Star.” See under Ellipsis, page 92.

When the interposed sentence is thrown in by way of remark, it is
called

Epitrechon; or, Running Along
Parenthetic Addition by way of Statement thrown in, not complete in
itself
Ep’-i-tre-chon, from ἑτή (epi), upon, and τρέχειν (trechein), to run: to
run over or along, to overrun.

The figure is so-called because the sentence, more or less short,

is rapidly thrown in as an explanatory remark.
