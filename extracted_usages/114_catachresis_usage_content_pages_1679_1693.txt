iii. Of one word, where the Greek receives its real meaning by
permutation from the Hebrew, or some other language, or
foreign usage.

i. Of two words, where the meanings are remotely akin
Lev. 26:30.-‘I will cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols.”

Here the word “carcase” is changed from its strictly correct
application to flesh and blood, and its use applied to the fragments of
wood or stone of an idol.

Num. 9:18.-“At the mouth of Jehovah.”

Here it is translated “commandment”: but the figure arrests us; and
points us to the Divine Source of the command as opposed to any
human injunction. See Epistrophe.

Deu. 16:7.-“And thou shalt cook and eat it in the place which the Lord
thy God shall choose.”

Both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

render it “roast.” The latter however puts seethe in the margin.
“Seethe” is sometimes used for cook: and thus there is a remote
connection with roast, as commanded, in Exo. 12:8-9. So 1Sa. 2:15.
Compare Joe. 3:13 (4:13).

Deu. 32:14.-“Thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.”

Here “blood” is used by Catachresis. For, as “blood” is that which
comes from man, so the juice is that which comes from the grape.
There is an incongruity, because the two are only remotely akin. But
our attention is attracted to what is being said.
2Sa. 23:17.-“Is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
their lives?”
The water which the three mighty men brought to David is called
their blood: and thus, in one incongruous word, is eloquently
expressed the shedding of their own blood, which the men had risked
for David's sake.

Job. 4:12.-“Now a word was brought by stealth to me.”

This is a most unusual way of describing an angelic
communication.

Psa. 74:1.-“Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy
pasture?”

Psa. 80:4 (5).-“How long wilt thou smoke against the prayer of thy
people?” (margin).

Used by Catachresis for the heat of anger.

Psa. 88:5.-“Free among the dead”: {6., set at liberty is put by
Catachresis for cast off, deserted.

Isa. 62:5.-“For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons
marry thee.”

To speak of sons marrying their mother is incongruous, and yet
what else could be said? How else could it be expressed? But ané.
(baal) means not only {ο marry, but to possess; or as we express it “to
have and to hold’ in possession. This is the primitive and proper
meaning of the word, and to marry is only a secondary usage. It
means to have, own, possess. See 1Ch. 4:22, “who had the dominion
in Moab”; Isa. 26:13, “other lords beside thee have had dominion over
us.”

It is from not seeing the beautiful figure Catachresis here, by
which, through what looks like an incongruity, that Bishop Lowth and
others suggest an emendation of the Hebrew Text, by reading adée
(bonahyik), thy builders, for adée (bahnayik), thy sons. The change
is plausible; but it is destitute of any MS. or other ancient authority;
and such arbitrary alterations of the Text are to be deprecated, being
purely conjectural. Moreover, it is unnecessary, for the builder is not
necessarily the possessor or the owner. The apparent incongruity of
the figure arrests our attention; and, when we give the attention which
is thus demanded, we find the passage means that as a young man
marries a virgin, so shall Zion’s sons hold her in sure and happy
possession.

Hos. 14:2 (3).-“So will we render the calves of our lips”: /.e., our lips
as sacrifices. See under Metonymy; and compare Heb. 13:15.
Mat. 12:5.-“On the sabbath days the Priests in the temple profane the
sabbath, and are blameless.” It sounds incongruous to state this as a
fact: but it expresses what was true according to the mistaken notions
of the Pharisees as to manual works performed on the sabbath.
Rom. 7:23.-1 see another law in my members.” He means that he
sees sin: which, through the authority with which it rules his members,
he calls, by Catachresis, “law.” See under Antanaclasis.
1Co. 1:25.-“The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men.” It is incongruous to speak of
“foolishness” or “weakness” with respect to God. So we are arrested
by the use of this figure Catachresis.
Col. 3:5.-“Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.”
The members which commit the sins are put by a forcible Catachresis
for the sins themselves. For the sins are immediately enumerated, not
the members. See chap. 2:11.
ii. Of two words, where the meanings are different

Exo. 5:21.-“Ye have made our savour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh.”

Here “stink” and “eyes” are incongruously conjoined to call our
attention to the highest degree of abhorrence.
Exo. 20:18 (15).-“And all the people saw the thunderings.”

Here seeing is joined to what was only heard. But see under
Zeugma, by which one verb is made to go with two different nouns.
(See Rev. 1:12 below).

Mar. 7:21-22.-“Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts ... an evil eye.”
Here the Catachresis is only in appearance, as “an evil eye” is put
by Metonymy for envy, which does proceed out of the heart.

Compare Mat. 20:15, and see further under Asyndeton.
1Ti. 6:19.-“Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”

Here the “laying up treasure” is joined with “foundation,” and
“laying hold” is joined with the house which is from heaven. 2Co. 5:2.
Rev. 1:12.-“And | turned to see the voice that spake with me.”

Here “voice” is put by Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ), for the
person speaking. Apart from this, there is a Catachresis; seeing being
joined with that which is invisible and only heard. (See Exo. 20:18.)

iii. Of one word, where the Greek receives its real meaning by

permutation from another language, or foreign usage
Mat. 8:6. Act. 4:27.-Where traic (pais), a child, is used of a servant,
from the Hebrew αἴζ (nahar), which has both meanings. The A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] renders it “servant” in Matt., and “child” in Acts; while the R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “servant” in both places,
spelling it in Acts “Servant.”

Mat. 11:25; Luk. 10:21; Rom. 14:11; Heb. 13:15.- ὁμολογεῖν
(homologein), to confess, is used of to praise or celebrate, like the
Hebrew alaa (hqdah) which has both meanings. See Gen. 49:8.
2598. 22:50.

Mat. 24:29.-“And the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.” Here,
δυνάμεις (dunameis), powers, means really armies, from the Hebrew
aéé (chayeel) which has both meanings.

Mat. 28:1.-μία (mia), one, is the Greek cardinal numeral, but it is used
here for the ordinal, first, like the Hebrew fca (echad), which has
both meanings. See Gen. 1:5, etc. (See Mar. 16:9.)

Luk. 1:37.-“For with God nothing shall be impossible.” Here, ῥῆμα
(rheema), word or saying, is used for thing, the Hebrew aar (davar)
having both meanings. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
renders ῥῆμα literally; αἱ the expense of forcing the word ἀδυναρήσει
(adunateesei), shall be impossible; which it renders “shall be void of
power.”

Luk. 16:17.-“It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of
the law to fail.” Here, ρίρτειν (piptein), to fall or fail, is used for not to
be fulfilled, or to be of no effect (Rom. 9:6. 1Sa. 3:19). The Hebrew
66 (naphal) has both meanings. See Jos. 23:14. Est. 6:10.

The reference to the ‘tittle’ is interesting, and very beautifully
includes both the meanings.

The σῖα (cheren), horn, is called in the Greek κεραία (keraia), little
horn (Mat. 5:18 and Luk. 16:17). Another, and commoner Hebrew
name is ufari (taageem), little crowns.* [Note: The plural of )6
(cheren), horn, is !¥/UOZ> | (ch’rahnoth), horns.]

The Massorah explains that the /ittle horn or crown is an ornament
or little flourish (something like a tiny fleur-de-lis, of various forms, or a
mere hair-line flourish) placed above certain letters and coming out
from their top, according to certain definite and prescribed rules. Thus
the common fancy, which is as old as Jerome, is exploded: which
explained the “tittle” as being the difference between two similar
letters: e.g., Daleth (A) and Resh (1); Beth (A) and Kaph (6), etc.

The meaning of the passage is that it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one of these Taagim, or little crowns to
fall, or for the minutest word of God not to be fulfilled.
Act. 10:22. Luk. 1:6; Luk. 2:25.-δίκαιος (dikaios), which is an
adjective, and means strictly righteous, is used generally for a good
man, like the Heb., 6aé- (tzaddeek), which has both meanings.

Act. 13:34.-“The sure mercies of David.”

Here the words τὰ ὅσια (ta hosia), holy or just things, are used for
promises made, and mercies vouchsafed, in pure grace; the Heb.
cnaéi (chasadeem) having both meanings. The quotation is from
Isa. 15:3; and the reference is to Jehovah’s unconditional covenant
made with David in 2Sa. 7:1-29 The passage means “I will give to you
the faithful promises made to David.”

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] gives an unusually long marginal note; and the
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “I will give you the
holy and sure blessings of David’; which is very laboured and
obscure, compared with the simplicity of meaning conveyed and
brought out by the figure Catachresis, which shows that 2Sa. 7:1-29
was in question, and the holy things, i.e., the promises, there made in
grace to David.
1Со. 2:6.-“Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.”
Here the word τέλειος (teleios) receives its true meaning, initiated,
from the Greek mysteries, where it was used of one who had been
initiated into them.
1Co. 15:54.-“Death is swallowed up in victory”: i.e., for ever, as the
Heb. ἄδς (netzach) means, as well as victory, when it has the
Lamed (ὅ) prefixed. See Isa. 25:8 (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] ). Amo. 1:11 (both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ). Also Psa. 13:1 (2). Pro. 21:28.
2Co. 6:12; 2Co. 7:15. Luk. 1:78. Col. 3:12. Php. 1:8.- σπλάγχνα
(splangna), bowels, is used for mercy, like the Heb., rciéi
(rachameem), which has both meanings.

See Gen. 43:30. Psa. 51:1 (3). Pro. 12:10. When used with the
word “mercies” itself, it denotes tender mercies.

Gal. 2:21.-“I do not frustrate (or esteem at a small price) the grace of
God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead (i.e.,
died) in vain.” Here, δωρεάν (dqrean), a free gift, is put for µάτην
(mateen), in vain; and the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] so translates it. The R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it “for nought.” But, like
the Heb. cdi (chinnam), µάτην means in vain, while δωρεάν means
without a cause. See Psa. 109:3.

1Th. 4:4, and 1Pe. 3:7, where σκεῦος (skeuos), a vase or utensil, is
used for the Heb. 666 (klee), which has a wider meaning,
instrument or weapon. See Hos. 13:15, and 1Sa. 21:3-6.

Heb. 11:31; Jam. 2:25.-“The harlot Rahab”: where πόρνη (pornee), a
harlot, receives its true meaning from the Heb. élda (zqbnah) which
means a female hostess, or landlady, as well as harlot.

1Pe. 3:14.-δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee), righteousness, is used of
ordinary piety, kindness, etc. So 2Co. 9:9. Mat. 6:1 according to one
reading (see Metonymy and Synecdoche).

Rev. 2:7; Rev. 22:2; Rev. 22:14.-‘The tree of life.” In the Greek €UAov
(xylon) means wood; but receives its meaning of “tree” from the Heb.
ᾖό (eytz), tree, which is frequently rendered €UAov (xylon) in the LXX.
[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]
Rev. 14:8; Rev. 18:3.-“She hath made all nations drink of the wine of
the wrath of her fornication.” Here, θυμός (thumos), wrath, means
heat, as well as anger; like the Heb. cia (cheymah), heat, venom, or
poison. See Job. 6:4, where the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint
Version (325 b.c.).] renders it θυµός (thumos), evil or affliction, as
Mat. 6:34. So that the meaning is “the heating or poisonous wine of
her fornication.”
Metallage; or, a Changing Over

A different subject of thought substituted for the original subject
Me-tal’-la-gee. Greek µεταλλαγή, from µετά (meta), beyond, or across;
and ἀλλαγή (allagee), a change, exchange (from ἀλλάσσω, allasso).
Hence, Metallage means a taking over in exchange.

In this figure the word taken over is exchanged for a separate
object of thought.
