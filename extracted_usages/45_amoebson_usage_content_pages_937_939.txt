AmecebZon; or, Refrain
The Repetition of the same Phrase at the End of successive
Paragraphs

Am-ce-bf-on. № is from the Greek ἁμοιβή (amoibee), change,
alteration (from ἁμείβειν (ameibein), to change. It is used of the
repetition of the same phrase or sentence, where it occurs in poetry at
the end of successive periods.

Cycloides may occur at the beginning, or middle, or any part of the
circle, but AmoebZon only at the end.

This burden, therefore, thus emphasized is the main point for us to
notice in what is being said.
Psa. 118:1-4.-Where, we have the refrain “For His mercy endureth for
ever.” (See under Symploce).

“For His mercy endureth for ever.”
Isa. 9:12; Isa. 9:17; Isa. 9:21; Isa. 10:4.-Where we have the four-fold
burden, to emphasize the solemn warning, “For all this his anger is not
turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”
Amo. 4:6; Amo. 4:8-11.-Here we have the solemn refrain five times

repeated “Yet have ye not returned unto me saith the Lord.”

lesson, “Verily ... they have their reward.” See under /diom.

tell you, Nay; but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.”

fact repeated for our assurance, | will raise him up at the last day.”
This, of course, is the Resurrection which was the subject of Old

Test ment prophecy, and the one referred to in Rev. 20:1-15 (the first

or former of the two there named). But not the one which was the

subject of a special revelation to the Church of God in 1Th. 4:16.
Rev. 2:7; Rev. 2:11; Rev. 2:17; Rev. 2:29; Rev. 3:6; Rev. 3:13; Rev.
3:22.-Seven times, at the end of each of these Epistles is the solemn
burden repeated “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
saith unto the Churches.”

These words are in the figure called Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ,) but this seven-fold repetition, is the figure of Amoebfon. See
under Polyptoton for the significance of this phrase, as here used.*
[Note: Also the series of articles in Things to Come, commencing
September, 1898.]

Rev. 18:21-23.-Here, the figure Epistrophe in the repetition of the
words “no more at all” becomes the figure AmoebZon in that the words
