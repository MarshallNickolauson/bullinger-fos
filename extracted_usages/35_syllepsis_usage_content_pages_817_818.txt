which involves change rather than addition. It will be found therefore
under those figures in our third division.
2Ch. 31:8.-“They blessed the Lord and his people Israel.”

Here there is a duplex statement. They blessed the Lord, that is
they gave Him thanks and celebrated His praises; and they blessed
His People Israel; but in a different way; they prayed for all spiritual
and temporal blessings for them in the name of the Lord.

Two meanings are thus given to the word, which is used only
once. The sense is repeated, but not the word, and the sense is not
the same in each case.

Joe. 2:13.-“Rend your heart, and not your garments.”

Here the word “rend” is used only once, but with two significations:
in the former sentence it is used figuratively; in the latter literally-the
heart not being rent in the same sense in which garments are rent.

3. Of Different Words
(a) In a similar order (and in the same sense)
Symploce; or, Intertwining
The Repetition of different Words in successive Sentences in the
same Order and the same Sense

Sym -plo-kee’, from σύν (sun), together with, and πλοκή (plokee), a
folding. An intertwining of two different words in a similar order: one at
the beginning and the other at the end of successive sentences.

It is a combination of Anaphora (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) and
Epistrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

The Latins called it COMPLEXIO, combination, and
COMPLICATIO, a folding together.

When phrases or sentences are thus repeated, instead of single
words, it is called Coenotes (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
