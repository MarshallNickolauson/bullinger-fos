Mar. 15:12-14.-Where Pilate’s words (verses 12, 14) are interrupted
by the shouts of the People (verse 13). The events took place literally
in this order: but, instead of describing the two events separately,
Pilate’s words and the People’s are described at one and the same
time.

Rev. 16:13-16.-Here the description (14, 16) of the work of the three
unclean spirits in gathering together the kings of the earth to
Armageddon is interrupted by verse 15; which is an injunction
specially referring to that same time, and is therefore introduced there,
by Simultaneum, for the sake of emphasis.
