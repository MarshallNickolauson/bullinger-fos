no, not by a mighty hand.”

Mar. 10:43-44.-In verse 43, “Whosoever will be great among you,
shall be your minister (or servant).”

And in the next verse the meaning is the same, but the Epitasis is
added, “of all”:-“Whosoever will be the chiefest, shall be the servant of
all.”

Joh. 13:34.-“A new commandment | give unto you, That ye love one
another-(then the Epitasis is added)-as | have loved you, that ye
also love one another.”

Act. 7:5.-“And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much
as to set his foot on.”

Rom. 13:1.-“The powers that be are ordained of God.” This is an
Epitasis to explain and augment the force of the previous enunciation.
2Co. 3:1-18 : where verse 6 is an Epitasis to verse 5, explaining and
emphasizing what has been before said.
