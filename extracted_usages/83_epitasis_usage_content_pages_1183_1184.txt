The Figure is used when a concluding sentence is added by way
of increasing the emphasis. It is not independent of what has gone
before, but it is some emphatic increase added to it by way of
conclusion.

The Latins called it INTENTIO, which means the same thing, a
straining, or tension; increase, or augmentation

The difference between this figure and the figure of Amplification is
that it comes by way of Conclusion.

Exo. 3:19.-“And | am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go,
no, not by a mighty hand.”

Mar. 10:43-44.-In verse 43, “Whosoever will be great among you,
shall be your minister (or servant).”

And in the next verse the meaning is the same, but the Epitasis is
added, “of all”:-“Whosoever will be the chiefest, shall be the servant of
all.”

Joh. 13:34.-“A new commandment | give unto you, That ye love one
another-(then the Epitasis is added)-as | have loved you, that ye
also love one another.”

Act. 7:5.-“And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much
as to set his foot on.”

Rom. 13:1.-“The powers that be are ordained of God.” This is an
Epitasis to explain and augment the force of the previous enunciation.
2Co. 3:1-18 : where verse 6 is an Epitasis to verse 5, explaining and
emphasizing what has been before said.
Anesis; or, Abating

Addition of Conclusion by way of lessening the Effect
An’‘-e-sis (ἄνεσις), a loosening, relaxing, abating. This is the opposite
of Epitasis; the addition of a concluding sentence which diminishes the
effect of what has been said.
2Ki. 5:1.-“Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord
had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valour,
but he was a leper”: and therefore all his grandeur and importance
counted for nothing.
