wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy
presence.” See also under Euche.

There are many examples, which the Bible student will call to mind
or search out for himself.
Gal. 5:12.-“I would that they were even cut off which trouble you.”

Thaumasmos; or, Wondering
An Expression of Feeling by way of Wonder

Thau-mas‘-mos. Greek, θαυμασμός, а marvelling. The figure is used
when, instead of describing or stating a thing as a matter of fact, it is
expressed in the form of marvelling at it, either directly or by
implication.

When the wonder is expressed as an exclamation, it combines
with it the character of Ecphonesis (see below).
Num. 24:5.-“How goodly thy tents, О Jacob.”
Mat. 8:10.-“When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
followed, Verily | say unto you, | have not found so great faith, no, not
in Israel.”

Rom. 11:33.-“O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out!”

This is a proper Ecphonesis, except that it expresses wonder and
astonishment, so that it is combined with Thaumasmos.

Gal. 1:6.-“I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Christ unto another (ἕτερον (heteron), different)
Gospel.”

A simple statement would have expressed the fact, “Ye are soon
removed,” etc., but thus solemnly is our attention called to the whole
subject-matter of the epistle.

See under Correspondence (the order of the seven Pauline
Epistles).
Pranismos; or, Exultation
An Expression of Feeling by calling on Others to Rejoice
