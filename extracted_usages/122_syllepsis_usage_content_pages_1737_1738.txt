Joh. 16:13-14.-“When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
unto all truth,” etc.

Here, though the word ~ =" ‘ (pneuma), Spirit, is neuter, the word ©
== |! (ekeinos), He, is masculine; agreeing with the Divine Person
rather than with the actual word “Spirit.”

Joh. 21:12.-“And none (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.] ) of
the disciples durst ask him Who art thou? knowing (pl. [Note: The
Plural Number.] ) that it was the Lord.”

The figure points out that not one asked; for all knew.
2Co. 5:19.-“God was in Christ, reconciling the world (sing. [Note: ing.
The Singular Number.] ,) unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them (pl. [Note: The Plural Number-.] ).”

Here, the figure Metonymy, by which the “world” is put for its
inhabitants, is interpreted by the use of the plural, “them.”
