It is a kind of Zeugma, in that one adjective or verb belonging to
two or more nouns of different genders, persons, or numbers, agrees
with one rather than with another.

Syllepsis therefore depends on a change or disturbance in the
concord of parts of speech; in making a /ogica/ rather than a
grammatical concord.

Joh. 16:13-14.-“When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
unto all truth,” etc.

Here, though the word ~ =" ‘ (pneuma), Spirit, is neuter, the word ©
== |! (ekeinos), He, is masculine; agreeing with the Divine Person
rather than with the actual word “Spirit.”

Joh. 21:12.-“And none (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.] ) of
the disciples durst ask him Who art thou? knowing (pl. [Note: The
Plural Number.] ) that it was the Lord.”

The figure points out that not one asked; for all knew.
2Co. 5:19.-“God was in Christ, reconciling the world (sing. [Note: ing.
The Singular Number.] ,) unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them (pl. [Note: The Plural Number-.] ).”

Here, the figure Metonymy, by which the “world” is put for its
inhabitants, is interpreted by the use of the plural, “them.”
Tmesis; or, Mid-cut
A Change by which one Word is cut in two, and another Wordput in
between
Tm??-sis. Greek, | 2 a cutting, from |" (temnein), to cut.

It is a figure by which a compound word or connected phrase is
separated, and the position of its syllables changed, by the
intervention of one or more words.

Each of the syllables thus cut off is a separate and complete word.
Thus in “to us ward,” the word “toward” is, by the figure Tmesis, cut in
two: and the word “us” is put in between the two separated words, “to
us ward.” So also we say “to heaven ward,” or “what condition soever.”

The figure is also called DIACOPE, Di-ac’-o-pee. Greek, μα а
cutting in two.

DIRESIS, D?-??-re-sis. Greek, "(= Г! (diairesis), a dividing
through.

DIASTOLE, Di-as-to-lee. Greek, "'(Г!!=, a separating through.

ECTASIS, Ec’-ta-sis. Greek, 9 |<"), a stretching out.

DIALYSIS, Di-al’-y-sis. Greek, “=. "!, a dissolving or parting
