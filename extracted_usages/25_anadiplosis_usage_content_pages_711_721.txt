Both were created “in the beginning.” But the earth, at some time,
and by some means, and from some cause (not stated) became a
ruin:-empty, waste, and desolate; or, as it is expressed by another
Figure (Paronomasia, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), tohoo and bohoo.
Now, whatever may be the meaning of tohoo (Wal), it is expressly
stated, in Isa. 45:18, by Him who created the earth that “He created it
not tohoo (Ualy.” Therefore it must at, and after some subsequent
period of unknown duration, have fallen into the ruin which the second
verse declares and describes.

The repetition of the word “earth” here, directs our attention to this
fact; and proceeds to describe the process by which the earth was
restored and peopled.

The whole chapter exhibits a parallel between this work, and that
“new creation” [Note: Compare 2Co. 4:6; 20ο. 5:17, etc.; and see a
pamphlet on “The New Creation and the Old,” by the same author and
publisher.] which takes place in the case of every one who is born
again of the Holy Ghost, and has the new man created within him.
*Gen. 7:18-19.-“And the ark went upon the face of the waters: and
the waters prevailed exceedingly.” (See under Epizeuxis).
*Gen. 31:6-7.-“Ye know that with all my power | have served your
father: and your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages
ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.” (See under
Hysterologia and Idiom.

*Gen. 31:33-34.-“Then went he out of Leah’s tent and entered into the
tent of Rachel. Now Rachel had taken the images,” etc. Here, by
rendering it “Rachel's tent” the figure is hidden, and the emphasis on
Rachel is lost.

*Exo. 7:16-17.-Here the figure is entirely hidden in the English. The
words 6a, ёа being translated hitherto and this. To preserve the
figure we must render it, “And, behold, thou wouldest not hear until
now. Now saith Jehovah.”

*Ехо. 12:4-5.-“Every man, according to his eating shall make your
count for the lamb. The lamb shall be without blemish.”

*Exo. 32:16.-“And the tables were the work of God, and the writing,
the writing of God, graven upon the tables.” Here we have not only
the figure of Anadiplosis in the repetition of the word writing (éua,
miktav), in the middle of the verse, but we have Epanadiplosis in the
repetition of the words, the tables (aéeu, halluchoth). See also
under Anthopopatheia.
*Num. 33:3-4.-“Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the
Egyptians. For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, etc.”
*Deu. 31:3-4.-“And Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as hath said
Jehovah, and Jehovah shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and Og,
etc.”
*2Sa. 9:12-13.-“All that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
Mephibosheth. So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem.”
*2Sa. 19:10-11.--“Now, therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing
back the King? And the King David sent to Zadok,” etc. This
emphasis on the word king is lost in the English.
*Est. 6:5-6.-“And the king said, Let him come in. Then came in
Haman.”
*Est. 7:7-8.-“Не saw that there was evil determined against him by
the king. Then the king returned out of the palace garden.”

Thus tbe fourth acrostic containing the name of Jehovah is
emphasised.* [Note: See under Acrostichion (page 186), also a
pamphlet on these four acrostics by the same author and publisher.]
Psa. 98:4-5.-The Hebrew figure is lost in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , but is
preserved in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] In the
Hebrew, verse 4 ends with the word CiFl-(zammeroo), and verse 5
begins with the same word.

“Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth:

Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.

Sing praises unto the Lord with the harp.”
Psa. 113:8.-

“He lifteth the needy out of the dunghill,

That He may set him with princes;

The princes of His People.”
Psa. 115:12.-

“The Lord hath been mindful of us, and He will bless:

He will bless the house of Israel.
He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless them that fear the Lord,” etc.
Here, the figure of Anadiplosis passes on into Anaphora.
σα. 121:1-2.-
“| will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
my help.
My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and
earth.”
*Psa. 122:2-3.-
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compacted together.”
The difference between this figure and that of Epizeuxis will be
seen by comparing Mat. 23:37; when the same word is repeated, but
in quite a different manner; for another purpose and with another
emphasis.
Psa. 126:2-3.-
“Then said they among the heathen,
The Lord hath done great things for them,
The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.”
Psa. 127:1-2.-
“Except the Lord keep the city,
The watchman waketh in vain.
In vain ye rise up early,” etc.
Psa. 145:18.-
“The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him;
To all that call upon him in truth”
*Pro. 13:21-22.-
“To the righteous shall be repayed good.
A good man leaveth an inheritance,” etc.
*Isa. 24:4-5.-“Languish do the haughty people of the land.
The land also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof.”
These four lines form an Epanodos (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
*Hos. 2:21-22 (Hebrews 23, 24).-“And they shall hear the land: and
the land shall hear the corn,” etc.

See also under Anaphora, Polysyndeton, Climax and
Prosopoposia: so richly emphasized is the wondrous prophecy.

Mat. 7:22.-“Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in
thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
wonderful works? Here the Anadiplosis develops into Anaphora by the
repetition of the words at the beginning of the last sentence. See
under Erotesis.

Hab. 3:2.-“Revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of
the years make known.” See also under Pleonasm.

Mat. 10:40.-“He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that
receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.” The figure is Clearer in the
Greek than in the English.

Joh. 14:11.-“Believe me that | am in the Father, and the Father in
me.”

Joh. 18:37.- is difficult to express the figure in this verse in English.
The “I” is repeated thus:
“Thou sayest that a King am I. I to this end was born.”
Rom. 8:17.-“If children, then heirs: heirs of God, etc.”
Rom. 9:30.-“What shall we say then? That the Gentiles which
followed not after righteousness have attained to righteoushess;
righteousness which is of faith.”
Rom. 10:17.-“So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
word of God.”
2Co. 5:17-18.-To see the figure, which is in the Greek, we must
translate “Behold, become new are all things, and all things are of
God.”
2Co. 9:6.-“Не that soweth sparingly, sparingly shall reap also: he
that soweth bountifully, bountifully shall reap also.”
Here is combined also the figure of Symploce (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ) in the repetition of the words “sow” and “reap.” There is also a
double Epanodos in the arrangement of the lines.

Gal. 4:31; Gal. 5:1.-So then, brethren, we are not children of a
bondwoman, but of the free (ἐλευθέρας, eleutheras). In the freedom
(ἐλευθερία, eleutheria) wherewith Christ hath made us free, stand
fast.”
Php. 2:8.-“And being found in fashion as a man, he became obedient
unto death, the death of the cross.”
Jam. 1:3.-“The trying of your faith worketh patience, but patience-let
it have its perfect work, etc.” See below, under Climax.

Climax; or, Gradation

Repeated Anadiplosis

When Anadiplosis is repeated in successive sentences, it is called
Climax, from κλῖμαξ (klimax), a ladder, a gradual ascent, a going up by
steps.
