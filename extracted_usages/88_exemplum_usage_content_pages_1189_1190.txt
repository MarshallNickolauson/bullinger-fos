willing, but the flesh is weak.”
Php. 4:10.-‘I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now, at the last, your
care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were careful also, but ye
lacked opportunity.”

When what has been said concludes with an example, it is called

Exemplum; or, Example
Addition of Conclusion by way of Example

This is not the same as using examples in the course of argument. We
do this latter when in any reasoning we adduce one known object or
thing as a sample of another in respect to some particular point.

Exemplum, on the other hand, is when we conclude a sentence by
employing an example as a precedent to be followed or avoided:-
Luk. 17:31-32.-“In that day, he which shall be upon the house top, and
his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he
that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot’s
wife.”
Symperasma; or, Concluding Summary
Addition of Conclusion by way of a brief Summary
Sym’-per-as’-ma (συμπέρασμα), a finishing or end. In logic it is the
conclusion of a syllogism. It is from σύν (sun), together with, and
περαιόω (peraio?), to carry over or across-

Hence, Symperasma means to conclude along with, to end
together, and is used when what has been said is briefly summed up,
and when certain foregoing enumerations are given in a brief epitome.

It is called also ATHRCESMOS (a-throes’-mos), from ἀθροίξω
(athroiz?), to collect or gather together.

It differs from Synathroesmus (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ) in that it is
used at the end and as the conclusion of what has been before said,
and not in the course, and as part of the statement.

Mat. 1:17.-Here, in this one verse, is given a brief summary of the
preceding sixteen verses.
