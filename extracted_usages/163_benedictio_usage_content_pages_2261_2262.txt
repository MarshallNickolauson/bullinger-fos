blessing, and the blessing itself.

The latter is called a beatitude or blessing.

A large field of study is here opened out before us. It is
unnecessary for us to exhaust it. The student will find much spoil in
searching out and classifying the various blessings and beatitudes
which come under this figure.

See, for example, Deu. 28:3-6. Ecc. 10:17. Isa. 30:18. Eph. 1:3.

Then they may be considered collectively.

The three blessings at the creation. Gen. 1:22; Gen. 1:28; Gen.
2:3.

The blessings in the book of Psalms (1:1; 2:12; 32:1, 2; 33:12;
34:8 (9); 40:4 (5); 44:1 (2); 65:4 (5); 84:4, 5, 12 (5, 6, 13); 89:15 (16):
94:12; 106:3; 112:1; 119:1, 2; 127:5; 128:1 (2); 137:8, 9; 144:14, 15;
146:5).

The seven blessings in the Apocalypse. Rev. 1:3; Rev. 14:13; Rev.
16:15; Rev. 19:9; Rev. 20:6; Rev. 22:7; Rev. 22:14.
Euche; or, Prayer
An Expression of Feeling by way of Prayer, Curse, or Imprecation
Eu’-chee. Greek, εὐχή, а prayer, wish, or vow. Latin VOTUM.

This includes a prayer, or wish; also a prayer for evil; hence curse,
imprecation.

This figure is a change by which a statement is expressed as a
prayer, instead of as a matter of fact. And where the prayer comes in
by way of parenthesis caused by the sudden change.

Its use arises from and betokens an excited Condition of feeling.

The Scriptures abound with examples of all kinds, which may be
sought out and studied for instruction and example.

See Deu. 28:67. Isa. 64:1-2 (63:19; 64:1). Act. 26:29. Rom. 9:3.

The subject to which this figure introduces us may be treated of
quite separately: as the prayer may be introduced as an ejaculation,
as a parenthesis, or as an addition or conclusion, etc.
