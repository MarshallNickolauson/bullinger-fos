Gen. 13:5.-“And the land was not able to bear them that they might
dwell together: for their substance was so great that they could not
dwell together.”
Deu. 27:15-26, where each clause ends with the word “Amen.”
Deu. 32:10.-* [Note: The Errata section of the print edition marks this
example for deletion.] It is beautifully expressed in the Hebrew by the
repetition of the pronoun al (Лы), him, at the end of each sentence. It
in hidden in the translation, both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] ‚ on account of not being in accordance
with the English idiom. It reads:-

“In a desert land He found him

And in the waste howling wilderness, about, he led him.

He instructed him.

As the apple of His eye He kept him.”

So also in verse 12:-
“So the Lord alone did lead him,
And there was no strange god with him.”
Psa. 24:10.-
“Who is this King of glory?
The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.”
Psa. 115:9-11.-
“O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah,
he is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron trust in Jehovah,
he is their help and their shield.
Ye that fear the Lord, trust in Jehovah,
he is their help and their shield.”
Thus is emphasized by Epistrophe the strength and security of
Jehovah's people.
Psa. 118:18-19.-Twice we have the Epistrophe:-
“Than to put any confidence in man.”
And three times (verses 10-11):-
“But in the name of the Lord | will destroy them.”
We have also Anaphora in verses 8, 9, and 10-12.
See also in the Psalms called the “Songs of degrees”:
120:2, 3, “false or deceitful tongue”;
121:3, 4, “not slumber’;
123:4, 5, “contempt”;

125:1, 2, “for ever’;

131:2, “a weaned child’;

132:2, 5, “the mighty God of Jacob.”
Psa. 136:1-26 is a notable example of this figure, for every clause
ends with the well-known words, “for his mercy endureth for ever.”
Eze. 33:25-26.-The words are twice repeated to emphasize their
solemnity. “And shall ye possess the land.”
Joe. 2:26-27.-Twice are the Words repeated and thus solemnly
emphasized. “And my people shall never be ashamed.”
Rom. 8:31.-

“If God be for us

Who can be against us?”
Rev. 7:5-8, which have the repetition of the sealing and the number,
as we have Anaphora at the beginning in the words “of the tribe.”
Rev. 22:11.-We have here the word “still” repeated at the end of four
successive sentences. The figure of Polysyndeton is also seen in the
repetition of the word “and” at the beginning of these sentences (verse
17).

The repetition of the verb “come.”

This figure may not only exist in the originals, and be hidden in the
translation, but there may apparently be a repetition in the English
when there may be none in the original. For example, Act. 19:15,
“Jesus | know, and Paul | know.” But, in the Greek, the two words for
“know” are quite different. Jesus | know (γινώσκω (gingbskq), to
perceive, or know, and to be influenced by the knowledge), and Paul |
know (ἑτήσταμαι (epistamai), to have knowledge of).
