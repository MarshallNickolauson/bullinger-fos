return (i.e., the returning of Christ). Ἀναλύω (апа/иф), to loosen back

verb:- Luk. 12:36. Tob. 2:1. Jdt. 13:1. 1Es. 3:3. Wisd. 2:1; 5:12. Sir.

other two, viz., the return of Christ, which was “far better” than either.

time, but to position or grade.

The verbs to become and to be, with an adverb or adverbial
phrase often change the signification of the adverb into that of a noun.
See 2Sa. 11:23. Joh. 6:25. Mar. 4:10. Act. 5:34; Act. 13:5. Rom. 7:3;

IV. Antimereia of the Noun
1. A Noun for a Verb
This is called “Antimereia of the Noun.”
Jdg. 16:23.-“Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together
for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their God, and to rejoice.” Lit,
for a great rejoicing.
Isa. 7:1.-“Rezin ... and Pekah ... went up toward Jerusalem to war
against it.”
Lit., for the war. Fig., to make war.
Mar. 12:38.-“And he said unto them in his doctrine.” Here, the noun
“doctrine” is put instead of the verb, “during his teaching” or, “while he
taught.”
2. A Noun for an Adverb
Isa. 21:7.-“And he hearkened diligently with much heed”: i.e., most
attentively.
Psa. 75:2 (3).-“I will judge upright [judgments]”: i.e., righteously. So
Pro. 31:9.
Psa. 139:14.-“I will praise thee, for | am made with fears and wonder’:
ie., fearfully and wonderfully.
Lam. 1:8.-“Jerusalem hath sinned a sin”: i.e., grievously.
Mar. 7:3.-“Except they wash their hands with the fist”: {6., carefully or
assiduously.
Mar. 8:32.-“And he spake the word with boldness”: i.e., boldly, openly,
or publicly. So Joh. 7:26; Joh. 10:24; Joh. 11:14; Joh. 16:25; Joh.
16:29; Joh. 18:20; Joh. 11:54.
3. A Noun for an Adjective

Thus “circumcision” and “uncircumcision” are used instead of
circumcised or uncircumcised persons.

Anathema, which means accursed, is an accursed or
excommunicated person or thing.
1Co. 14:12.-“So also ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spirits.”
Here, the noun is used instead of an adjective (πνευμάτων for
πνευματικῶν). Both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] insert “gifts” in italics.
1Со. 14:32.-“And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the
prophets.” Here, the noun “spirits” is again used for the adjective
Spiritual gifts. See under Metonymy.
Gal. 1:14.-“Being more exceedingly a zealot”: i.e., zealous, as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
16111]
Heb. 12:11.-“Any discipline for the present (time) seems not to be of
joy” (xapdc, charas): i.e. joyous, “but of grief’ (λύπης, /ирее5): {9.,
grievous, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.]
1Jn. 5:6.-“Because the Spirit is truth.” Here the noun is rendered
literally: but it is used by the figure Antimereia for the adjective true;
and the meaning is that the witness of the Holy Spirit concerning
Christ is true in every place and in every particular.

If this figure were not Enallage, then it would be a Metaphor, which
is quite out of the question.
4. A Noun (repeated) for an Adjective
A noun is sometimes repeated in order to express the adjective in the
highest or superlative degree. This is called Geminatio or Epizeuxis
(q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ).
Isa. 26:3.-“Thou wilt keep him in peace, peace”: i.e., perfect peace.
See under Epizeuxis, where many examples are given.

5. A. Noun (in regimen) for an Adjective

When, of two nouns, one noun is placed in regimen: i.e., when one
governs the other in the genitive case: the latter word (sometimes two
words) becomes an adjective.

The natural and ordinary way of qualifying a noun is by using an
adjective. But, if it is wished to emphasize the adjective, then this rule
is departed from; in order to attract the attention of the reader, and to
tell him that the adjective is very emphatic, and is to be read as if it
were underlined or under-scored in ordinary writing. For example:
suppose we are speaking of Angels, and our thought is simply of them
and their being, we should use the word “mighty” as an adjective, and
say “Mighty ANGELS,” but if we wished to emphasize the adjective
“mighty,” and call attention to the fact that we are not referring to
angels as such, but to their wondrous power, and we should say
“MIGHTY Angels.” How is this to be done? By Antimereia. By using a
noun instead of an adjective, and saying “Angels of might.”

It is difficult to say how this should be dealt with in translation so as
to render it idiomatically, and yet apprise the reader of the correct
emphasis.
Neither the Authorized nor the Revised Version follows any fixed
rule. Sometimes the noun is translated literally, and sometimes it is
rendered as an adjective.

It is important, however, that the reader (especially the public
reader) should know where the emphasis is required.

It should be observed, however, that the second noun (i.e., the
noun in the genitive case) is not always used instead of an adjective.

The word “of” takes many different meanings; and it is important
that each should be accurately defined and determined.

As this, however, does not belong strictly to the figure Antimereia,
we have given an outline of the whole subject in the Appendix. (See
Appendix B “On the usuage of the Genitive case.”)

The following are examples of Antimereia, where a noun in
regimen is used instead of an adjective:-

2Ch. 20:29.-“A fear of God”: {6., a great fear.

2Ch. 28:13.-“A trespass of Jehovah”: {6., a terrible sin.

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] entirely loses the sense of this verse, which
should be thus rendered: “Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; for
ye propose that which will bring upon us a trespass of Jehovah (i.e., a
trespass of the greatest magnitude) to add to our sin and to our guilt;
for abundant is the guilt we have and the fierceness of anger on
Israel.”
Job. 4:9.-A blast of Eloah”: a vehement blast.

Psa. 104:16.-“Trees of Jehovah”: i.e., the loftiest trees.
Son. 8:6.-“Flames of Jehovah”: ᾖθ., vehement flames. The verse
should be rendered:

“For love is strong as death:

Affection is inexorable as Sheol:

Its flames are flames of fire:

The flames of Jehovah.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s

Introduction, page 386.]

Jer. 2:31.-Here the last syllable of the word “darkness,” έᾶ, is an
abbreviation of Jehovah; and the words should be rendered:

“Have | been a wilderness to Israel.
Is the land the darkness of Jah?” i.e., utter darkness.
[Note: Ditto, page 384.]
Eze. 28:13; Eze. 31:8-9.-“Garden of God”: i.e., the Divine, beautiful or
wonderful garden.

The Name of God is used in the same way in the dative case.
Rth. 2:20.-“Blessed be he to the Lord”: i.e., divinely blessed with all
things. Rth. 3:10, “Blessed be thou to the Lord.”

Isa. 28:2. Here, it is literally:
“Behold, a mighty and strong one to Adonai”: i.e.,
“Behold, a mighty one, immensely strong-
As astorm of hail, a destructive storm;
As a flood of mighty waters overflowing
Hath he cast [Ephraim] down to the earth with his hand.”
Jon. 3:3.-“A city great to God”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , an exceeding
great city.
Act. 7:20.-Moses was “fair to God”: i.e., Divinely beautiful.
2Co. 10:4.-“For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
to God” (so A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] margin): i.e., immensely powerful.
The word “sons” or “children” with a noun (in regimen) is used
idiomatically:-

The word “son,” when qualified by another noun, denotes the
nature and character of the person or persons so named, and even
their source and origin: e.g., “sons of Belial” (margin, naughty men).
Deu. 13:13. Jdg. 19:22.

“Sons of valour” (2Sa. 2:7. 1Ki. 1:52. Deu. 3:18): /е., brave
men.

“Sons of the pledges”: i.e., hostages (2Ki. 14:14).

“Son of oil” (Isa. 5:1, marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) beautifully
rendered “in a very fruitful hill.”

“Sons of light” (Luk. 16:8): ie., men illuminated from above
(Joh. 12:36. 1Th. 5:5. Eph. 5:8).
“Children of the devil” (1Jn. 3:10. Act. 13:10).
“Children of wrath” (Eph. 2:2).
“Children of this world” (Luk. 20:34): ie, men who are
characterized by living for this present age or life.
“Children of the resurrection” (Luk. 20:36): i.e., raised from the
dead.
“Children of disobedience”: i.e., disobedient children (Eph.
2:2).
“Children of obedience”: i.e., obedient children (1Ре. 1:14).
Heb. 10:39 must be explained by this usage, if sense is to be made of
the words, the difficulty of which is seen in the R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] margin: “But we are not [children of unbelief]
of drawing back unto destruction of the soul ({6., unbelievers), but
[children] of faith (i.e., believers) unto the gaining of it.”

So the expression “son of man,” “sons of men,” “children of men”
is a Hebrew idiom for a human being as distinct from a beast on the
one hand and from God or angelic beings on the other (Gen. 11:5,
etc.).
In like manner the “sons of God” in the New Testament are those
who partake of the New, Divine, or spiritual nature (2Pe. 1:4), whether
angels or men, as distinct from the beasts and from mere human
beings.

Beni Ha-Elohim, the sons of God, is used seven times in the Old
Testament for angels (see above).
Once it is used of Restored Israel (Hos. 1:10) in Heb. 2:1, but here
the expression is different, Beni El-hai.

In the singular with both articles it is used of Christ.

“The Son of God” is that blessed one who is perfect man and
perfect God, perfectly human as “the Son of man” (also with both
articles) and perfectly Divine as “the Son of God.”

6. Noun (governing) for Adjective
When the first noun (instead of the second noun, in regimen) is
changed, and used instead of the adjective, the figure is called
Hypallage. See below.
7. The former of Two Nouns (both in regimen) used for an
Adjective

When two nouns are both of them in regimen, and only one of them is
used for the adjective, sometimes it is the former* [Note: Sometimes it
is the latter that is put for the adjective. (See No. 8 below). Sometimes
they are both of them different forms of the genitive case, and one of
them is in regimen to the other: i.e., depends upon the other. For

examples of this, see Appendix B.] :

(a) Where the former of the two nouns (both in regimen) is used for an
adjective, and is to receive the emphasis.

Gen. 17:5.-“A father of a multitude of nations”: i.e., of many nations

(as in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] ), with the emphasis on many, as is explained in

Rom. 4:17.

Gen. 45:22.-“Changes of raiment.”

Act. 7:30.-“In a flame of a fire of a bush”: i.e., in a flame of a burning

bush.

Rom. 5:2.-“And rejoice in hope of the glory of God”: {6., and rejoice in

God’s glorious hope.

Rom. 8:2.-“The law of the spirit of life”: i.e., the spiritual law of life.

2Со. 4:6.-“The knowledge of the glory of God”: i.e., the knowledge of

the glorious God.

Eph. 1:6.-“To the praise of the glory of His grace”: i.e., of His glorious

grace.

Tit. 2:13.-“The appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour”:
ie., the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus
Christ.

Rev. 18:3.-“The wine of the wrath of her fornication”: i.e., the furious
wine, etc.

8. The /atter of Two Nouns (both in regimen) used for an Adjective
Gen. 9:5.-“At the hand of a man of his brother”: i.e., at the hand of his
fellow or brother man. There is no “every” expressed in the Hebrew.
Rom. 3:23.-“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”:
ie., of God’s glory.

Rom. 8:3.-“In likeness of flesh of sin”: i.e., sinful flesh’s likeness.

Col. 1:11.-“According to the power of the glory of Him”: i.e., according

to His glorious power.

Col. 1:13.-“And hath translated us into the kingdom of the son of His

love”: {6., His beloved Son’s kingdom. See Mat. 3:17.

9. One of two Nouns in the same case (and not in regimen) used
for an Adjective

When two nouns in the same case are united by a conjunction, one of
them (generally the latter) is used as a very emphatic adjective, e.g.,
Act. 14:13 : “They brought oxen and garlands,” means “They brought
oxen, yes, and they were garlanded too!” This figure is called
Hendiadys, under which the reader will find many examples.
10. Noun (in regimen) for superlative of Adjective

When the latter noun is the genitive plural of the former noun e.g.,
King of Kings, Holy of Holies, it is put instead of, and to emphasise,
the superlative degree of the adjective. As this is a species of
Polyptoton, we have put the examples under that figure (q.v. [Νοίε:
Which see_] ).
