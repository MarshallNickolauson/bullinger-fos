The Latins called it SUBJECTIO, a substituting, RESPONSIO, a
responding.

It is a form of Dialogismos (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).

Affirmatio; or, Affirmation
Spontaneous Affirmation

Affirmation becomes a Figure when it is used otherwise than in
answer to a question; or, instead of a bare statement of the fact.

It emphasizes the words thus to affirm what no one has disputed.

The Apostle uses it in Php. 1:18, “What then? notwithstanding,
every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and |
therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”
