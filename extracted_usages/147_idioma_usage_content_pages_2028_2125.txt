I. Verbs in General
i. Idiomatic usages of Verbs
1. The Hebrews used active verbs to express the agent’s design
or attempt to do anything, even though the thing was not actually
done
Exo. 8:18 (14).-“And the magicians did so ({6., attempted to do so)

with their enchantments, to bring forth lice, but they could not.”
Deu. 28:68.-“Ye shall be sold (i.e., put up for sale) unto your enemies
„.. and no man shall buy you.”
Eze. 24:13.-“Because | have purged thee (i.e., used the means to
purge, by instructions, reproofs and ordinances, etc.), and thou wast
not purged.”

We have the same usage in the New Testament.
Mat. 17:11.-“Elijah truly cometh first, and restoreth all things”: {6.,
shall begin to restore or design or attempt to do so, for Christ will be
the real Restorer of all things. The contrast here, however, is between
Elijah and John, as brought out by the μὲν and the δέ. “Elijah, indeed
(μὲν, in one respect) cometh, and will restore all things, but (δέ, in
another respect) | say unto you that Elijah is come already,” etc.
Gal. 5:4.-“Whosoever of you are justified (i.e., seek to be justified) by
the law; ye are fallen from grace”: for chap. 3:11 distinctly declares
that “no man is justified by the law in the sight of God.”
Php. 3:15.-“As many as be ({6., would be, or try to be) perfect.”
1Jn. 1:10.-“We make him (i.e., we attempt so far as in us lies to make
him) a liar.” (See also chapter 5:10).
1Jn. 2:26.-“These things have | written unto you concerning them that
seduce (or deceive) you”: i.e., that would, or that try to, deceive you.

2. Active Verbs are sometimes used to denote the effect of the

action expressed

Isa. 65:1.-“I am sought of them that asked not for me”: i.e., | am found
of them that sought me not, as in Rom. 10:20.
Joh. 16:5.-“None of you asketh me whither goest thou”: i.e., none of
you knoweth or hath discovered; for Peter had asked that question in
13:36. Lit., None is enquiring.

3. Active Verbs are used to declare that the thing has been or
shall be done, and not the actual doing of the thing said to be
done
The Priest is said to cleanse or pollute according as he declares that
the thing is clean or polluted. See Lev. 13:6; Lev. 13:8; Lev. 13:11; Lev.
13:13; Lev. 13:17; Lev. 13:20, αἵο., where it is actually translated

“pronounce.” See under Metonymy (of the subject) and Synecdoche.
Act. 10:15.-“What God hath cleansed (i.e., declared to be clean) do
not thou pollute (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] “call common’).”

Isa. 6:10.-“Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears
heavy,” i.e., declare, or foretell that the heart of this people will be fat,
etc. (See Metonymy). In Mat. 13:15, this idiomatic use of the verb is
not literally translated, but is idiomatically rendered “the heart of this
people is waxed gross.” So in Act. 28:27. While, in Joh. 12:40, it is
rendered literally according to the Hebrew idiom: “He hath blinded,”
etc.; but who hath done so is not said.

Jer. 1:10.-“I have this day set thee over the nations and over the

kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down,” etc.: ie., to declare or

prophesy concerning the nations that they shall be rooted out, etc.
The Anglo-Israelites, wrongly taking this literally, declare that Great

Britain is now literally fulfilling this prophecy!

Eze. 43:3.-“According to the vision that | saw when | came to destroy

the city,” etc.: ie., when | came to prophesy or declare that it should

be destroyed.

Eze. 22:2.-“Son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of

bloods (i.e., of great bloodshedding)?” This is explained in the words

that follow: “Yea, thou shalt shew her (Heb., make her know) all her

abominations.” See under Heterosis.

4. Active verbs were used by the Hebrews to express, not the
doing of the thing, but the permission of the thing which the
agent is said to do. Thus:

Gen. 31:7.-Jacob says to Laban: “God did not give him to do me evil”:
ie., as in AV. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] , God suffered him not, etc.
Exo. 4:21.-“I will harden his heart (i.e., | will permit or suffer his heart
to be hardened), that he shall not let the people go.” So in all the
passages which speak of the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart. As is clear
from the common use of the same /diom in the following passages.
Exo. 5:22.-“Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people?”
ie., suffered them to be so evil entreated.

Psa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not give thine Holy One (i.e., suffer Him) to see
corruption.” So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.]

Jer. 4:10.-“Lord God, surely thou hast greatly deceived this people”:
i.e., thou hast suffered this People to be greatly deceived, by the false
prophets, saying: Ye shall have peace, etc.

Eze. 14:9.-“If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, |
the Lord have deceived that prophet”: {6., | have permitted him to
deceive himself.

Eze. 20:25.-“Wherefore | gave them also statutes that were not good”:
i.e., | permitted them to follow the wicked statutes of the surrounding
nations, mentioned and forbidden in Lev. 18:3.

Mat. 6:13.-“Lead us not (i.e., suffer us not to be led) into temptation.”
Mat. 11:25.-“l thank thee, О Father ... because thou hast hid (i.e., not
revealed) these things,” etc.
Mat. 13:11.-“It is given to know unto you,” etc. (i.e., ye are permitted to
know ... but they are not permitted to know them.

Act. 13:29.-“When they (i.e., the rulers, verse 27) had fulfilled all that
was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him т а
sepulchre”: i.e., they permitted Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus
to do so.

Rom. 9:18.-“Whom he will he hardeneth”: i.e., he suffereth to be
hardened. Not that this in any way weakens the absolute sovereignty
of God.

Rom. 11:7.-“The rest were hardened”: i.e., were suffered to become
blind (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).

Rom. 11:8.-“God hath given them the spirit of slumber”: i.e., hath
suffered them to fall asleep.

2Th. 2:11.-“For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie”: i.e., God will leave them and suffer them to
be deceived by the great Lie which will come on all the world.

5. Active verbs are used to express, not the doing of a thing, but
the occasion of a thing’s being done
Gen. 42:38.-“If mischief befall him by the way ... then shall ye bring
down (i.e., ye shall be the occasion of bringing down) my gray hairs,”
etc.
1Ki. 14:16.-Jeroboam “made Israel to sin”: ie., was the cause of
Israel's sin by setting up the two calves in Bethel and Dan.
Act. 1:18.-“This man purchased a field” (i.e., caused the field to be
purchased), as is plain from Mat. 27:7.

6. Two imperatives are sometimes united, so that the first
expresses a condition or limitation in regard to the second; by
which the latter becomes a future
This idiom was also used by the Latins “Divide et impera,” not divide

and govern, but divide and thou wilt govern.

Joh. 7:52.-“Search and look”: {6., search and thou wilt see.

1Со. 15:34,-“Awake to righteousness, and sin not”: i.e., and then ye
will not sin.

1Ti. 6:12.-“Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life”: {6.,
thou shalt lay hold of, etc.
Sometimes the future is used literally instead of the idiomatic
second imperative. See Joh. 2:19. Jam. 4:7. In Eph. 5:14, we have
two imperatives and then the future.

ii. Special idiomatic usages of Nouns and Verbs
(1) Noun (in regimen) for Adjective. See under Heterosis.

(2) Noun (a second) for Adjective. See Hendiadys.

(3) Plural Nouns for emphatic singular. See Heterosis.

(4) Certain Adjectives or Nouns used in the New Testament,
according to Hebrew idiom, in a sense peculiar to themselves:-

“Able,” when applied to God or Christ, denotes both willingness
and ability. Rom. 4:21; Rom. 11:23; Rom. 14:4; Rom. 16:25. Heb.
2:18.

“All” often denotes the greater part. 1Co. 8:1, for see verse 17.
1Co. 11:2.

“All” often means the greatest degree or quality of that to which it
is applied. 1Co. 13:2. 2Ti. 1:15. Jam. 1:2.
“All” signifies some of every kind. Mat. 4:23. Act. 10:12. See
further for the usage of the word “all,” under Metonymy and
Synecdoche.

“A blessing’ signifies a gift.

Gen. 33:11.-Jacob says to Esau: “Take, | pray thee, my blessing ({6.,
my gift and present) that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt
graciously with me, and because | have enough (Heb., all things). And
he urged him, and he took it”: {6., everything.

1Sa. 25:27.-“This blessing (i.e., gift; margin, present) which thine
handmaid hath brought.”

Rom. 15:29.-“I shall come in the fulness of the blessing (i.e., the gift)
of the Gospel of Christ.”
2Co. 9:5.-“That they would go before unto you, and make up
beforehand your blessing”: i.e., your gift to the saints (see A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).

“Doctrine” (διδαχή, didachee) means the thing taught; but it is
used idiomatically and by Metonymy (α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), for the
discourse in which it is taught.

This is because it denotes more than διδασκαλία (didaskalia), for it
has to do with the style of teaching; the manner as well as the thing
taught. See, e.g., Mat. 7:28-29.
Mar. 4:2.-“He taught them many things by parables, and said unto
them in his doctrine”: i.e., his teaching or discourse. So chap. 11:18;
12:38.
Act. 2:42.-“And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine”:
ie., they regularly attended at the teaching of the apostles: i.e., when
they taught.
1Co. 14:26.-“Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, etc.”:
i.e., a discourse to give.

“To eat or drink.”-As the Hebrews used the nouns meat and drink
of knowledge (by Metonymy, α.ν. [Note: Which see] ), so they
naturally used the verbs eating and drinking to denote the operation of
the mind in receiving, understanding, and applying doctrine or
instruction of any kind, as we speak of “digesting” what is said, or of
“inwardly digesting’ it.

It thus marks a very intimate and real partaking of the benefits of
that which we receive through our minds.

Jer. 15:16.-“Thy words were found, and | did eat them.” The rest of
the verse explains the figure.

Eze. 3:1.-“Son of man ... eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of
Israel”: i.e., consider it, and get the contents of this roll by heart, and
then go and speak it to the house of Israel, as is clear from verse 4:
“Speak with my words unto them.”

Joh. 6:51.-“I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if
any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever”: i.e., just as the body
lives temporally by eating bread, so the new life is nourished by
feeding upon Christ in our hearts by faith.

So, verse 53: “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink
his blood, ye have no life in you”: {6., except you feed on Christ in
your hearts and partake of His life (for the blood is the life), ye have no
life in you. That this cannot refer to the Lord’s supper is clear from the
fact that it was not then instituted, and the words could not have been
understood (as they were); and, further, that it would shut out all who,
from age and infirmity or other cause, had not partaken of that supper.

It cannot refer to the Mass, as there is no drinking at all in the
Mass.

By comparing verses 47 and 40 with verses 53 and 54, it will be
seen that believing on Christ is exactly the same thing as eating and
drinking of His flesh and blood.
1Co. 12:13.-“And have been all made to drink into one spirit”: i.e.,
receive. Compare Luk. 13:15.

“Not to be” is a Hebraism for to be abject and vile, to be nothing
(10ο. 1:28); while on the other hand,

“To be” means to be in high esteem, or of great value (1Co. 1:28).
God hath chosen “things which are not, to bring to nought things that
are.” So also
2Sa. 19:6 (9).-“Thou regardest neither princes nor servants.” Here, the
figure is translated; for the Heb. is (as in the margin: “that princes and
servants are not to thee.”) R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :
“Are nought unto thee.”
“To permit.” Heb. 6:3 : “This will we do, if God permit”: i.e., if God
so orders it, and gives the needed grace and strength.
“To seek.” Mat. 6:32 : “After all these things do the Gentiles seek”:
ie., they put them in the first place, and are over-anxious, with
excessive solicitude. So Luk. 12:30.

“To salute.” Act. 18:22 : “And when he had ... gone up, and
saluted the church”: i.e., and had held familiar intercourse with them.
Compare 20:1. See also 21:7, 19; 25:13. This is shown from the
opposite; 2Ki. 4:29 : “Salute him not”: {6., do not stop to talk with him.
So Luk. 10:4.

“To touch’ for to hurt or to do any harm to. Gen. 26:29. Rth. 2:9.
Job. 1:11; Job. 2:5; Job. 19:21. Psa. 105:15. Jer. 12:14. Eze. 17:10.
Zec. 2:8. Heb. 11:28. 1Jn. 5:18.

Also, “to touch” is used for cohabitation. Gen. 20:6. Pro. 6:29. 1Co.
τι.

Also, for detention, or for diverting from any purpose. Joh. 20:17.

“To come”: where the simple verb is used for all that pertains to
Christ's advent. Mat. 11:3. 1Jn. 4:2-3; 1Jn. 5:6.

“To see another’ is used for making war with him, or of meeting
him in battle. 2Ki. 14:8; 2Ki. 14:11; 2Ki. 23:29, etc.
“To build” is used for restore anything to all its former glory. Eze.
26:14.

“To walk” is used for proceeding happily and prosperously. Hos.
14:9.

“To hear” is used of understanding and obeying. Joh. 8:47. Luk.
8:15.

“To confess’ is used of abiding in the faith, and walking according
to truth. 1Jn. 4:15. Rom. 10:9-10. So also Mat. 10:32.

“Able to say” is used of being able really and truly to affirm from
the heart. Pro. 20:9.
1Co. 12:3.-“No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghost.” Any one can utter the words; but no one can truly, with the
whole heart, own Jesus as his Lord, and take Him for his Master, but
by the Holy Ghost.

“To eat and drink” is a Hebraism used not merely for chewing
food or swallowing any liquid, but for good living and drinking wine;
Mat. 11:18-19 with Luk. 7:33-34 and Pro. 31:4.

“To do” for to bring to pass, do a very great deal, do all. So it is
translated in Psa. 37:5. Dan. 9:19.

“To do (i.e., commit) sin” means to sin wilfully and willingly. 1Jn.
3:9. See 1:8, 10; 5:18. Joh. 8:34.

“To do justice or righteousness” is used for willingly, earnestly
and joyfully walking and living as one whom God has justified. 1Jn.
3:7.

“To work’ is used of seeking to gain salvation by human merit.
Rom. 4:4-5, as opposed to grace (chap. 11:6).

“To give account” means not simply to render a mere account,
but to suffer all the consequences of unrighteousness. 1Pe. 4:5. Mat.
12:36.

“To will” is used for to wish to do anything speedily and
spontaneously. 2Co. 8:11. The figure is well translated “to be forward”
(verse 10)-as being greater even than the actual doing.

Also for eager desire (Mar. 10:35; Mar. 12:38), where the figure is
well translated “which love to go in long clothing,” etc. Gal. 4:21,
where it is well rendered “desire.” “Tell me, ye that desire (love) to be
under the law.” So it ought to be rendered in 1Ti. 6:9 : “They that will to
be rich”: i.e., love to be rich.
“To look” or “to see” is often used (a) implying the delight or
pleasure felt by the beholder (whether it be sinful or innocent): Psa.
22:17 (18); 35:21; 59:10 (11). (b) Sometimes also as implying sorrow
and grief: Gen. 21:16; Gen. 44:34. Joh. 19:37 (compare Zec.
12:10-14. Rev. 1:7). (ο) And sometimes implying attention and
provision: 2Ki. 10:3. Mat. 7:5. 1Co. 10:12 (where the figure is well
translated “take heed,” as it is also in Col. 4:17).
“To live” is used not merely of being alive, or having life, but of
having all that makes life worth living, flourishing and prospering. 1Sa.
10:24, where the figure is rendered “God save,” “God save the king.”
The Heb. is “Let the king live.” So also 1Ki. 1:25. In 1Sa. 25:6, it is
rendered “That liveth in prosperity.” Psa. 22:26 (27); 69:32 (33). Ecc.
6:8. 1Th. 3:8. (The opposite of this is 1Sa. 25:37 : “his heart died
within him’).

The word “life” has also the same usage, Psa. 34:12 (13). 1Pe.
3:10, as it has also in our English idiom.

“To hear.” The verb ἀκούειν (akouein), to hear, is used
idiomatically when followed by the accusative case. It then means, not
only to hear the voice of the person speaking (which is indicated by
the genitive case following), but to understand, to receive, to believe,
etc., what is said, having regard, not to the speaker, but to the subject-
matter.

The apparent discrepancy between Act. 9:7 and Act. 22:9 is
explained by this idiomatic use of ἀκούειν (akouein). In the former
passage it is followed by the genitive case, and means that they heard
the sound of the voice; while in the latter passage, it is followed by the
accusative case, and means that they did not hear the subject-matter:
ie., they heard the sound of the voice, but did not understand what
was said.

Joh. 8:43.-“Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye
cannot hear (i.e., receive) my word.”

Joh. 9:27.-“I have told you already, and ye did not hear ({6., believe).
Why again do ye desire to hear?” In the latter clause it is used in its
ordinary sense; in the former idiomatically.

1Со. 14:2.-“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not to
men, but to God, for no one heareth ({6., understandeth) him.” The
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] so renders it, and puts “heareth” in the margin.

Gal. 4:21.-“Ye, that desire to be under law, do ye not hear (i.e.,
understand) the Law?”

1Со. 5:1.-“It is commonly heard ({6., understood) that there is
fornication among you.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has “reported.”

“Hearing” акой (akoee) is used, not merely of the act of hearing,
but of what is heard: a narration, report, fame. This is a kind of
Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

Mat. 14:1.-“Herod the tetrarch heard the hearing (i.e., the fame) of
Jesus.”
Joh. 12:38.-“Who hath believed our hearing?” (/.e., our report).

“Called.” To be called is used of being acknowledged, accounted,
or simply of being.
1Jn. 3:1.-“That we should be called the sons of God.”

“Holy” means primarily that which is ceremonially clean and free
from defilement.

Deu. 23:14.-“Therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean
thing.”

Hence it means separated from a common to a sacred or special
use. For places and inanimate things can clearly be holy only in this
special sense, and not as regards intrinsic moral purity.

The word Holy in Hebrew sometimes means bountiful, merciful,
beneficent. And so may have the same meaning in some passages of
the New Testament. See Tit. 1:8. Heb. 7:26, etc.

“Honour” has a wide range of meaning in Hebrew, and is used of
nourishment, maintenance.

Mat. 15:6.-“And shall not honour (i.e., support) his father or his
mother.”
1Со. 12:26.-“Or one member be honoured (i.e., nourished) all the
members rejoice with it.”

1Ti. 5:3.-“Honour widows that are really widows,”: [.Θ., maintain them
out of the funds of the church, as is clear from verse 4.
1Ti. 5:17.-“Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
honour’: i.e., of a liberal (see Metonymy) maintenance.”

1Pe. 3:7.-“Giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel”:
i.e., nourishing and supporting her, etc.

“Hand.” For various idiomatic phrases in connection with the word
“hand,” see under Metonymy.

“Living” was used by the Hebrews to express the excellency of
the thing to which it is applied. In some cases the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has
“lively.”

Joh. 4:10-11.-“Living water.”
Act. 7:38.-“Living oracles.”
Heb. 10:20.-“Living way.”
1Pe. 2:4-5.-“Living stones.”
Rev. 7:17.-“Living fountains.”

“Riches” denotes not merely money, but an abundance of that to
which it is applied; as our English word “wealth” is used of things other
than money.
Rom. 2:4.-“Or despisest thou the riches (i.e., the greatness) of his
goodness?” {6., His abounding goodness, or wealth of goodness.
Eph. 1:7.-“According to the riches (i.e., the great abundance or
wealth) of his grace.”

Eph. 3:8.-“The unsearchable (or the untrackable) riches (i.e., wealth
or greatness) of Christ.” This greatness consisting of all God’s
purposes in Christ as set forth in this epistle; which the Old Testament
saints could not trace out or understand. See 1Pe. 1:10-11.

Col. 1:27.-“What is the riches ({6., the great abundance) of the glory
of this Mystery.”

Col. 2:2.-“All riches of the full assurance of understanding”: i.e., the
abundant or fullest assurance of knowledge.

“To sanctify” often means to make ceremonially clean: i.e., to
cleanse a thing from those defilements which made it unfit for sacred
uses. Hence, it means simply to set apart, fit, or prepare for a
particular purpose.

Jer. 12:3.-“Sanctify (i.e., prepare) them for the day of slaughter.”
1Co. 7:14.-“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband”: each (though one
be an unbeliever) is fitted to perform the respective duties as husband
and wife. So with the children, “now are they holy”: i.e., they were to
be no longer reckoned as idolators, but were separated from heathen
associations, and ceremonially free from such defilement. See under
“holy” above.

How can we “sanctify God,” as in Isa. 8:13. Mat. 6:9. 1Ре. 3:15,
except by setting Him high above and apart from every other object of
respect and veneration?

“Spirit? was used in various combinations by the Hebrews to
denote the greatest degree of any mental quality. As we speak of the
spirit or essence of any person or thing!

Luk. 10:21.-“Jesus rejoiced in spirit”: .e., exceedingly.

Act. 18:25.-“Being fervent in spirit” means exceedingly zealous. So
Rom. 12:11.

Act. 19:21.-“Paul purposed in spirit”: /.e., firmly resolved.

Act. 20:22.-“Behold, | go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem”: i.e., with
a fixed determination and settled purpose.

Rom. 1:9.-“Whom | serve with my spirit’: ie., with the most fervent
zeal.
“Walk” is used of one’s continued course of action and life: i.e., the
habitual habit and manner of life.

Gen. 5:22; Gen. 5:24.-“Enoch walked with God.”
Rom. 8:1.-“Who walk not after the flesh,” etc.
2Co. 5:7.-“We walk by faith, not by sight.”

“Word” (λόγος, Jogos) in the New Testament follows the Hebrew
idiom; and signifies not merely a word, but speech, which is the
outcome of words. Hence, it is used of any matter, thing, or affair of
any kind.

Luk. 1:2.-“Were eye witnesses and ministers of the Word”: i.e., the
Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Act. 6:2.-“It is not reason that we should leave the word of God (ie.,
the preaching and ministry of the Gospel), and serve tables.”
Act. 10:44.-“The Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word”: {6., the
Gospel which Peter preached.
Mat. 21:24.-“I also shall ask you one word”: i.e., one thing, or a
question as to one matter.
Act. 10:29.-Ч ask therefore for what word (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , for
what intent) ye have sent for me.”
Act. 19:38.-“Have a word.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has a matter; but according to
the Heb. idiom, an accusation.
1Co. 15:2.-“If ye keep in memory by what word | preached unto you”:
i.e., what was the subject-matter of my preaching.

Thus the word must take its colouring from the context. In Exo.
34:28, it means the ten commandments. So in Rom. 13:9.

In 1Co. 14:19, it means sentences.

The word “son” was used, not only by Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:
Which зее.] ), but idiomatically, and not according to Greek usage.

“A son of death” (1Sa. 20:31) means devoted to death, and is
rendered in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] : “he shall surely die.” So Psa. 102:20 (21).

This idiom means that the persons thus spoken of belong very
emphatically to that which they are thus said to be “sons of.”

“Sons of the bride-chamber.” Mat. 9:15. Luk. 5:34.

A “son of hell.” Mat. 23:15.

“Sons of the wicked one.” Mat. 13:38.

“Son of the devil.” Act. 13:10.

“Sons of disobedience.” This is very much stronger than the mere
tame expression disobedient children. It means that they pertain to
and belong to Satan in a special manner; are those in whom he works
(Eph. 2:2), and on whom the wrath of God comes (Eph. 5:6). It does
not say that God’s children were such, but only that we had our
conversation “among” them. We were, by nature, “sons of wrath”
(Eph. 2:3): ᾖ9., those deserving of God's wrath; but, through His grace
another has borne that wrath, as verses 4-7 goes on to say.
“The son of perdition” (2Th. 2:3. Joh. 17:12) is one who is lost in a
very emphatic and terrible sense.

See under Synecdoche.

iii. Idiomatic Degrees of Comparison
In the Hebrew there are several idiomatic ways of emphasizing
adjectives, and making them superlative.
1. Preposition after Adjective

By the use of the preposition “in” or “among” after a simple adjective,
as Pro. 30:30, “a lion, strong among beasts”: i.e., the strongest of
beasts.

The New Testament has the same /diom.
Luk. 1:42.-“Blessed art thou among women”: i.e., the most blessed of
women.
2. Noun (in regimen) for Adjective
By using a noun (by Enallage) instead of an adjective, and putting it in
regimen: as “angels of might,” which is stronger than simply using the
ordinary adjective “mighty.” “Kingdom of Heaven”: i.e., God’s kingdom,
as greater and better than all kingdoms which are “of” (ek) this world.
See for examples under Enallage.

3. Noun repeated in Genitive Plural
By repeating the same noun in the genitive plural, as “Heaven of
heavens”: {6., the highest heaven. See under Polyptoton.

4. “Of God” as Adjective

By using the words “of God” instead of an adjective, e.g.,
1Sa. 14:15.-“Tremblings of God”: i.e., great or very mighty tremblings,
meaning an earthquake.
Psa. 36:6 (7)-“Mountains of God”: ie., the loftiest or grandest
mountains. See under Enallage.
5. Duplication of Noun as Adjective
By the repetition of the same word, as “peace, peace”: {6., perfect
peace. So
Mat. 23:7 : “Rabbi, Rabbi”: i.e., most excellent Rabbi.
Mat. 7:21.-“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord”: i.e., most
gracious Lord.
Mar. 14:45.-“Master, master”: i.e., most excellent Master. See further
under Epizeuxis.
6. Two Nouns conjoined

By using a noun instead of an adjective, not in regimen, but (by
Hendiadys) in the same case and number, and joined to the other
noun by a conjunction.
2Sa. 20:19.-“A city and a mother’: i.e., a metropolitan city.
Act. 14:13.-“Oxen and garlands”: {Θ., oxen-yes, and garlanded oxen
too. See under Hendiadys.

7. Plural Noun for Singular Adjective
By using the plural instead of the singular.
Psa. 51:17 (19).-“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,” etc.: i.e.,
the great sacrifice which God requires is a broken spirit and a contrite
heart. See under Heterosis.

8. Verb and Cognate Noun
Even a verb can be exalted to a superlative degree, as well as an
adjective, by using with it a cognate noun: e.g.,
Luk. 22:15.-“With desire | have desired”: {6., | have greatly desired.
Act. 4:17.-“Let us threaten them with a threat”: i.e., let us threaten
them very severely.
Act. 5:28.-“Did we not charge you with a charge”: i.e., did we not
straitly charge you. See under Polyptoton.

9. Verb and its Participle
A verb can also be emphasized superlatively by combining with it its
participle: e.g., “Seeing | have seen”: {6., | have surely seen. “Dying
thou wilt die”: i.e., thou wilt surely die. See under Polyptoton.
iv. Idiomatic Use of Prepositions
Prepositions are used in the New Testament not according to the
Greek idiom, but to the Hebrew. The Greeks had many prepositions,
but the Hebrews had very few. Consequently, used according to the
Hebrew Idiom, the manifold relations cannot be expressed with great
definiteness.

The few Hebrew prepositions are used in the Old Testament with
various meanings which can be easily gathered from the context. For
example, the Hebrew ? (beth) means primarily in; but it also
frequently means by (with reference to the instrument used), or
among; or at, or near; also upon, and with. Now the Greeks have, and
would have used, a different preposition for each of these.

It is a great mistake, therefore, always to translate ἐν (en), in, as is
too frequently done in the New Testament. It must be taken with all the
shades and breadth of meaning which the Hebrew beth (2) has.
When the Greek of the New Testament is put into Hebrew, this fact is
at once clearly seen.

For example:-

Mat. 3:11.-John said, “I indeed baptize you with water.”
Mat. 7:2.-“With what judgment ye judge ... with what measure ye
meet.”
Mat. 7:6.-“Lest they trample them with (A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ under) their feet.”
Mar. 3:22.-“By the prince of the devils.”
Luk. 11:20.-“With the finger of God.”
Luk. 22:49.-“Shall we smite with the sword.”
Rev. 1:5.-“Washed us from our sins by (or through) his own blood,”
not “in,” as A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
renders this “by,” and puts in the margin, “Greek, in.”
Rev. 5:9.-Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it properly “by.”

v. Idiomatic Use of Numerals
1. According to the Hebrew idiom, the numeral cic (heis), one, is

used instead of the ordinary pronoun

Mat. 8:19.-“One scribe said to him”: i.e., one of the scribes, or a
certain particular scribe.
See also 9:18; 16:14; 18:24, 28; 21:19; 26:69. Mar. 10:17; Mar.
12:42. Luk. 5:12; Luk. 5:17. Joh. 6:9; Joh. 7:21; Joh. 20:7. Rev. 8:13,
etc.

2. Sometimes, following the Hebrew idiom, the negative is joined
with the verb instead of with the predicate: e.g.

Mat. 10:29.-“One of them shall not fall.” The ordinary Greek idiom

would be, “not one (οὐδείς) of them shall fall.” Luk. 12:6.

3. The adjective ac (pas), every or all is frequently so used
The Hebrews would say everything is not, and this is put instead of
the ordinary Greek idiom, nothing is.

Psa. 103:2.-“Forget not all his benefits”: i.e., forget not any.
Luk. 1:37.-“Every thing will not be impossible with God”: i.e., nothing
is impossible.

So Mat. 24:22. Mar. 13:20. Joh. 3:15-16; Joh. 6:39; Joh. 12:46.
Rom. 3:20. 1Со. 1:29. Gal. 2:16. 1Jn. 2:21. Rev. 18:22.
4. In Hebrew the numeral is doubled to express distribution
We find this in the New Testament, instead of the Greek idiom which
expresses it by the preposition avd (ana). We find the Hebrew idiom,
e.g., in Mar. 6:7, “He sent them two two” (i.e., two and two together):
ie., in pairs. Compare the Greek idiom in Luk. 10:1.

This idiom is not confined to numerals, for we find it with other
nouns: 6.0.,

Mar. 6:39, by companies (so Exo. 8:14 (10), LXX [Note: XX The
Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ).

In Mar. 6:40, both the Hebrew and Greek idioms are used.

Compare Luk. 9:14. 2Co. 4:16.

vi. Idiomatic forms of Quotations
In quotations the Hebrews generally omitted the word “saying,”
whenever the words of another speaker were quoted. They very
frequently stand alone without the verb “saying.” Hence it is often
supplied by italics. See Psa. 2:2, but sometimes even italics are
omitted, and the passage is most obscure.
Psa. 109:1-31 -“Saying” should be added in italics at the end of verse
5; all the words down to the end of verse 19 being the words of
David's adversaries which they spake against David. See this
passage under Ellipsis (page 33).
Psa. 144:12 should begin with the word “saying”; verses 12 to the
middle of verse 15 being the “vanity” and the “falsehood” which the
“strange children” spake (verses 8, 11).

See this passage also under Ellipsis (page 33).

From this usage another idiom followed, in the asking of a
question.

vii. Idiomatic Forms of Question

In Hebrew a question often begins with “if: ie., “if this be done”
means “tell me whether this is done.” But the Greeks never used the
“if in this sense in order to ask a question. In Greek it always
expresses a condition. Yet, following the Hebrew idiom, we have:
Luk. 22:49.-“/f we shall smite with sword”: {.6., shall we smite, etc.
viii. Idiomatic Phrases
1. “Answered and said” was used by Hebrew idiom of whatever kind
of speech is in question
It should therefore not be rendered literally, “Answered and said,” but
translated so as to express whatever may be the particular kind of
speech referred to in the verb “said”; e.g.:
Mat. 11:25.-“At that time Jesus answered and said, | thank thee, O
Father,” etc.
This should be, “At that time Jesus prayed and said,” etc.
Mar. 12:25.-“At that time Jesus answered and said, while he taught in
the temple, How say the scribes that Christ, etc.”
Here it should be “Asked and said.” So Mar. 13:2, etc.
Mar. 11:14.-“And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of
thee hereafter for ever.”
It is clear that this cannot be literally meant, for the tree had said
nothing. It should be “Jesus addressed the tree, and said to it.”
2. My soul, your soul, their souls, is the Hebrew idiom for myself,
yourself, yourselves, etc.
See Num. 23:10. Jdg. 16:30. Psa. 59:3 (4); 35:13; 103:1; 121:7, Jer.
18:20 (cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] 38:16).

Psa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e., me) in Sheol (or Hades,
the grave). This is explained in the next line as meaning “thou wilt not
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.”

So Act. 2:27; Act. 2:31; Act. 13:35.

It is resurrection from the grave which is taught and referred to
here, as is clear from Psa. 49:15 (16), where Sheo/ is properly
translated “grave.” See under Synecdoche.

3. “Out of the Way.”
ἐκ µέσου (2Th. 2:7) must not be translated literally, arise or become
developed “out of the midst,” as is done by a certain school of
prophetic students; because it is a Greek idiom for being out of the
way, and always implies decisive action, either of the person’s own
will or of force on the part of others.

Plutarch (Timol. 238. 3) says: “He determined to live by himself,
having got himself out of the way’ (i.e., from the public).

Herodotus (3. 83 and 8. 22). The speaker (in 8. 22) exhorts some,
and says: “Be on our side, but if this is impossible, then sit down out of
the way,” or as we should say in our idiom “stand aside” (not “arise out
of the midst”!)

The same idiom is found in Latin. Terence (Phorm. v. 8. 3) says:
“She is dead, she is gone from among us” (i.e., forced or torn away by
the cruel hand of death, “e medio abiit’).

The opposite expression shows the same thing.

In Xenophon (Cyr. v. 2. 26), some one asks: “What stands in the
way of your joining us?” (ἐν µέσῳ ἑστῆ: i.e., your standing in with us.

The same idiom is found in the Scriptures.

Mat. 13:49.-The wicked are “severed from among the just”: ({6.,
taken away by force).

Act. 17:33.-“Paul departed from among them.”

Act. 23:10.-Paul was taken “by force from among them.”

1Co. 5:2 is very clear: where the complaint is made that they had
not mourned that “he that hath done this deed might be taken away
from among you.”
2Co. 6:17.-“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
separate.”

Col. 2:14.-We read of the handwriting of ordinances which was
against us. Christ “took it out of the way.”

We have the same idiom in the Septuagint.

Isa. 52:11.-“Depart ye ... go ye out of the midst of her,” and

Isa. 57:1 (Ixx. 2).-“The righteous is taken away from the evil to
come.”

It is thus perfectly clear that, in 2Th. 2:7, where it says that he who
now holds fast [fo his position] will continue to do so until he is cast
out, the “he” is Satan, who is holding on to his position in the
heavenlies, until the great war shall take place (Rev. 12:1-17), and he
be cast out into the earth.

Then it is that (Rev. 13:1) “he stands (R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ) on the sand of the sea,” and as the result of this the
two beasts rise up. They cannot, therefore, “arise” till Satan is cast
out. This is the teaching of 2Th. 2:1-17 See further under Ellipsis.

4. “Breaking of Bread.”
“To break bread,” κλάσαι ἄρτον (klasai arton), is the literal rendering of
the Hebrew idiom 22? 22? (paras lechem), and it means to
partake of food, and is used of eating as in a meal.* [Note: Just as
among the Arabs to-day, the Idiom, to eat salt, means partaking of a
meal.] The figure (or idiom) arose from the fact that among the
Hebrews bread was made, not in loaves as with us, but in round
cakes about as thick as the thumb. These were always broken, and
not cut. Hence the origin of the phrase {ο break bread. Indeed so
close is the connection that we sometimes have the word “break”
without “bread.” So clear is the meaning that there may be the Ellipsis
of the latter word.
See examples of this Hebrew idiom in Jer. 16:7 (see A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin) “Neither shall men break bread for them,” as in Eze. 24:17.
Hos. 9:4. See Deu. 26:14, and Job. 42:11.

Isa. 58:7.-“Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry?”

Lam. 4:4.-“The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it
unto them.”

Eze. 18:7.-“Hath broken (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] given) bread to the hungry.”

We have the same Hebrew idiom in the Greek words of the New
Testament, and the readers could have had no other idea or meaning
in their minds (Mat. 14:19). He took the five loaves, and blessed, and
brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, etc. This was in
connection with ordinary eating. See Mat. 15:36; Mar. 8:6; Mar. 8:19;
Mar. 14:22.

Luk. 24:30.-“And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he
took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.”

In verse 35, they speak of how Christ “was known of them in
breaking of bread,” i.e., as He sat at meat with them.

Act. 27:33-36.-“This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried
and continued fasting,* [Note: See under Synecdoche.] having taken
nothing. Wherefore | pray you take some meat: for this is for your
health: ... And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave
thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he
began to eat. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took
some meat.”

It is perfectly clear that in all these cases the “breaking of bread” is
the ordinary Hebrew idiom for eating as in a meal. The bread could
not be eaten till it was broken, hence the idiom which is used by
Hebrews down to the present day.

It is also evident that the Passover was a meal, and it was at this
meal, and of it, that the idiom is used in Mat. 26:26. Mar. 14:22 Luk.
22:19. 1Co. 11:24.

In Act. 2:46, their breaking bread at home (margin) is mentioned to
emphasise the fact that they no longer offered sacrifices, and
therefore could not eat of them in the Temple. So that though they
went to the Temple to worship, they ate their meat at home in their
private houses.
It is incredible, therefore, that in Act. 20:7, the idiomatic expression
can mean in any sense the Lord’s supper, as is clear also from verse
11.

The one solitary passage left is 1Co. 10:16, “The bread which we
break.” This is referred by some to the Lord’s supper in ignorance of
the prevailing custom of the early Christians when meeting together
on the first day of the week. Assemblies were few, and the members
were scattered. Many came from long distances, and food had to be
brought for the day’s sustenance. The early fathers tell us that the
people brought from their own homes hampers filled with cooked
fowls, and geese, etc., meat, loaves of bread, with skin-bottles of
wine, etc. The rich brought of their abundance, and the poor of their
poverty. These Sunday feasts acquired the ecclesiastical name,
agapai or “love-feasts” (from ἀγάπη, brotherly love, see Jud. 1:12),
because the richer brethren made them for the benefit of the poor.

It is easy to see how this would in time become a feast; and how,
though all partook of the common food, some would have too much,
and some too little; and, as it is written, some would be hungry, and
others drunken (1Co. 11:21).
This looks as though the feast or meal itself came to be spoken of
as “the Lord’s supper,” from the fact that each received an equal
portion, as on that night when the Lord Himself presided, and received
it as from Himself and not merely from one another.

But in process of time, a special ordinance was added at the close
of these feasts, at the end of the assembly, and at the end of the day.
to which the name, “the Lord’s supper,” was afterwards confined, Up
to the time of Chrysostom it followed the feast; but, as superstition
increased, it preceded the feast; but for 700 years after Christ they
accompanied each other: and the Lord’s supper was unknown as a
separate ordinance!

As late as a.d. 692 the close of the Lenten fast was celebrated by
an agapee, or feast, as the anniversary of the institution of the Lord’s
supper; and in England the day was called Maunday Thursday, from
the maunds, i.e., the baskets or hampers in which the provisions were
brought. No one but Royalty now keeps up this ancient custom. It fell
into desuetude from the superstition of “fasting communion;” which
had been brought in (though Chrysostom wished himself anathema if
he had been guilty of it!).

The “breaking of bread” therefore was used of the love-feast, and
never, until recent years, used of the Lord’s supper as a separate
ordinance.

The error has arisen from the misunderstanding of the Hebrew
idiom; and, from translating literally that which is used as a figurative
expression.

Rome has done exactly the same, though in another direction.
Rome forces the words “to break bread,” to prove its practice of
withholding the cup from the laity, or of communion in one kind! Rome
argues that as it only says “bread,” and wine is not mentioned;
therefore the “wafer” is sufficient!

Had Gentiles been acquainted with the Hebraism, neither malice
nor ignorance could have diverted the words from their simple and
only meaning.

5. To “Take the Sword” is used for rashly usurping magisterial power
instead of giving obedience and subjection to God
Mat. 26:52.
6. To “Open the Mouth’ is a Hebraism, used for speaking at length or
with great solemnity, liberty, or freedom
Jdg. 11:35-36. Job. 3:1; Job. 33:2. Psa. 78:2. Pro. 31:26. Eze. 24:27.
Dan. 10:16. Mat. 5:2, with 13:35. Luk. 1:64. Act. 8:35; Act. 10:34. 2Co.
6:11. Rev. 13:6.

So the opposite, “not to open the mouth,” is a Hebraism for
silence:- Psa. 38:13 (14); 39:9 (10). Pro. 24:7. Isa. 53:7. Act. 8:32.

7. To “Taste Wine’ is a Hebraism for drinking with others to
indulgence

Dan. 5:2.

So also to “drink wine.” Pro. 31:4.

8. “What to me and to thee?”

ti ἐμοὶ Kai Goi (ti emoi kai soi) which is rendered, “What have | to do
with thee?” means what is there between thee and me: i.e., what have
we in common.

2Sa. 16:10; 2Sa. 19:22. 1Ki. 17:18. 2Ki. 3:13. Mat. 8:29. Mar. 1:24.
Luk. 4:34. Joh. 2:4.

9. “The Son of Man”

Under Synecdoche we have considered the ordinary meaning of “Son
of Man”; but, with the definite article, the phrase appears to have a
special idiomatic usage of its own. No one was ever so called, but
Christ Himself. He first thus calls Himself in Joh. 1:51 (52). The
reference is to the first occurrence of the phrase in Psa. 8:1-9, where
the title is seen to involve universal dominion in the earth. Dominion
was given to the first man, Adam, and lost. It is to be restored in “the
Son of man,” “the second man,” “the Lord from Heaven.”

From Joh. 12:34 (cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] 8:28),
the Jews rightly inferred that the title involved His Messiahship.
That the title has to do with dominion in the earth is clear from the
fact that it does not occur in the Epistles, and does not, therefore,
pertain to Christ in relation to the Church-the Body of which He is the
Head, though it occurs constantly in the Gospels, as well as in the
Apocalypse (but here only twice: 1:13, and 14:14).* [Note: See The
Divine Names and Titles, by the same author and publisher.]

10. “Turn to Ashes”
Psa. 20:3.-This was the Hebrew idiom for God’s acceptance of
offerings by fire: iie., He accepted them by causing fire to fall from
heaven and consume the sacrifice. No fire having its origin in this
world ever consumed the sacrifices which God accepted.

The sacrifices of the heathen were wholly independent of and
apart from God. He neither commanded them, nor accepted them. It is
even so with all worship now that is not the fruit of the Holy Spirit (who
is symbolized by burning fire). For the flesh to offer worship is the
offering of “strange fire.”

The fire which kindled the incense on the Golden Altar of worship
within the Holy Place was the same fire which had consumed the
sacrifice on the Brazen Altar. This tells us that there can be no incense
of prayer ascending to heaven that is not based on and does not
proceed from the blood of atonement.

That this fire from heaven was the essential part of God’s
acceptance of the offering may be seen from the fact that the fire of
God fell from heaven at the first (Lev. 9:24) (at the Tabernacle), and
again at the Temple (2Ch. 7:1), and that fire was kept continually
burning.

Whenever God accepted an offering away from the one place
which He had appointed the fire fell especially upon that occasion
only. See Gideon, Jdg. 6:21; Manoah, Jdg. 13:15-23; David, 1Ch.
21:26; and Elijah, 1Ki. 18:38.

This, therefore, is what is meant in Gen. 4:4, when” the Lord had
respect unto Abel and to his offering,” because it was what He had
ordered. But to Cain and his offering God “had not respect,” because it
was not what He had appointed. “The way of Cain” (Jud. 1:11) is
therefore human inventions in Divine worship!

This is how Abel “obtained witness that he was righteous.” This is
how “God testified of his gifts.” This is how Abel “being dead, yet
speaketh” (Heb. 11:4), but few hear his voice. Few understand the
great fact that God left nothing for man’s imagination when He made
known how He would be approached, and how He would be
worshipped. In the last chapter of Exodus (40.), we have fourteen
times “thou shalt” (2-15), in the directions given to Moses; and eight
times the significant words that all was done “as the Lord commanded
Moses.” Then Leviticus, the book of worship, opens with the words:
“And the Lord called unto Moses ... out of the Tabernacle of the
congregation (for Moses was not able to enter in, Exo. 40:35), saying
... If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring,”
etc.

Thus it is the Lord who dictates the particulars as to how He will be
approached. And, if He does not accept the sacrifice by turning it to
ashes, in vain would they worship Him.

It is the same to-day. The true worshippers, who worship God, do
so in spirit, and through that sacrifice which God has accepted, even
Christ our substitute, on whom the Divine judgment fell instead of on
His People. “BY HIM?” it is that we offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name (Heb.
13:15).

There is no other worship now which He accepts, and no other
worshippers whom the Father seeks to worship Him (Joh. 4:23).

11. “The Sons of God” (Sons of Elohim)
This is the Hebrew idiomatic expression for angels. In every place
where the expression occurs, angelic beings are to be understood. It
occurs in:

Gen. 6:2; Gen. 6:4. Job. 1:6; Job. 2:1.-Where it is 27227222?
(benai ha-Elohim), sons of the Elohim.

Job. 38:7.-Where it is without the article, “Sons of Elohim.”

Psa. 29:1; Psa. 89:6 (7).-Where it is 2??? 22232 (benai Eyleem),
sons of Eyleem.

Dan. 3:25.-Where it is singular, “A son (Chald., 2?) of God.”

Seven times in all, and in each case it means angels.* [Note: In
Hos. 1:10 (2:1), it is a different form 7??? 2? 2? (Benai El hai),
sons of the living God. The context leaves us in no doubt that this is
used of men, and not angeles, for it is put in contrast with 22?
(ammai), my people.]

It is clear, therefore, that angels are meant in Gen. 6:2; Gen. 6:4,
and their “sin” is there recorded. How it was committed we are not
told. In 2Pe. 2:4; 2Pe. 2:9 and Jud. 1:6, it is further described, and is
spoken of in connection with Noah. Is it not strange that in 1Pe.
3:18-19, where exactly the same connections occur (i.e., “Noah,” and
“chains,” and “prison”), they should be taken for men! Especially when
we recall the statement that “He maketh His angels spirits” (Psa.
104:4. Heb. 1:7), and that man is never spoken of as a “spirit.” He is
said to have a spirit, but not to be one.

In Gen. 6:4, the progeny of these fallen angels is called
Nepheleem: i.e., the fallen ones (from 220, naphal, to fall): and so
awful were the consequences that all flesh was corrupt, and Noah was
the only one who was not tainted.* [Note: The two words “generations”
are not the same in Gen. 6:9. The first is Toledoth, meaning the off
spring in succession, while the second is Dorothai, which has respect
to breed (Isa. 53:8).]

All the race, therefore, had to be destroyed. Noah’s sons’ wives
were tainted, and this may be the solution of the Ethnological problem
as to the different races. There were Nepheleem in the days of Moses
(Num. 13:33), because it appears from Gen. 6:4 that there was
another irruption “after that”: {6., after the days of Noah. It was for the
extermination of this awful breed of beings that Israel was used: and
yet there are Christians with an excess of (false) charity who deplore
the slaughter effected by Israel, forgetting the necessity for the
destruction.
It was to these fallen angels, “reserved” and “in prison” in Tartarus
(the utmost bounds of creation) that the triumph of Christ reached and
was proclaimed-an encouragement to those who now “suffer’-bidding
them too, to look forward to the “glory” which shall surely
follow.t [Note: See The Spirits in Prison, by the same author and
publisher.]

12. “Three days and three nights”
Jon. 1:17 (2:1), quoted in Mat. 12:40.

The expression, “three days and three nights,” is an idiom which
covers any parts of three days and three nights.

In 1Sa. 30:11 (12), it is said that a certain Egyptian had not eaten
bread and drunk water for “three days and three nights,” and yet it was
only three days since he fell sick (ver. 13), not four days.

In Est. 4:16, Esther says she and her maidens will fast “three days
and three nights,” and yet it was on “the third day” that Esther went in
to the king; not the fourth day, which it must have been if the
expression were literally understood.

It may seem absurd to Gentiles and to Westerns to use words in
such a manner, but that does not alter the fact.
Now the New Testament is for the most part Hebrew in idiom, but
Greek in /anguage. This is the simple explanation of the difference
between it and classical Greek. Moreover, there is reason to believe
that the First Gospel, as we have it, is a translation from a Hebrew
Original. This is one of the idioms. It is used in Jon. 1:17 (2:1), and by
our Lord in Mat. 12:40. And yet many Scriptures say that He should
rise, and did actually rise on “the third day.” This could not have been
if the expression were used in its literal sense. It must have been the
fourth day and not the “third.”

The fact is that the idiom covers any part of “three days and three
nights.” This method of Hebrew reckoning is as distinct from Gentile
reckoning, as their commencing the day at sunset and our
commencing it at midnight. All these different modes of reckoning are
peculiar to the respective peoples and languages and must be duly
taken into account.

The Lord’s words in Mat. 12:40 do not disagree with the Scripture
assertion that He should rise on “the third day.”

We have the expression “after three days” once (Mat. 27:63), and
“in three days” once (Joh. 2:19). But the common expression is “on
the third day,” and it occurs ten times. But if the expression be literal
and not an idiom, all these passages should say the fourth day! Paul
preached the resurrection on “the third day” according to the
Scriptures (1Co. 15:4), and this is the great Scriptural fact which we
cannot get away from.

Neither can we alter the fact that He rose on “the first day of the
week.”

Neither can we alter the history which records His death and burial
as taking place the day before the Sabbath. “The sabbath drew on”
(Luk. 23:54. Mat. 27:62); “the day before the sabbath” (Mar. 15:42);
and yet the two disciples going to Emmaus on the first day of the week
say, “This is the third day (not the fourth) since these things were
done” (Luk. 24:21).

From all this it is perfectly clear that nothing is to be gained by
forcing the one passage (Mat. 12:40) to have a literal meaning, in the
face of all these other passages which distinctly state that the Lord
died and was buried the day before the Sabbath and rose the day
after it, viz., on the first day of the week. These many statements are
literal and are history: but the one passage is an idiom which means
any part of “three days and three nights.” The one complete day and
night (24 hours) and the parts of two nights (36 hours in all) fully
satisfy both the idiom and the history.

It may be added that we have a similar usage in English. When a
person is sentenced to “three days’ imprisonment,” it may be late in
the evening of the first day when he arrives at the prison, but when the
doors open on the morning of the third day (not the fourth) he walks
out a free man. In other words, if a person is commited to prison for
three days-and he reaches it on Monday night-he leaves it the first
thing on Wednesday morning.

See The Coming Prince, by Dr. Robert Anderson, C.B.

On the other hand,

“Thou sayest” is not, as is generally supposed, an idiomatic
expression, conveying merely a simple affirmation or consent.
The fact is that εἶπας (ejpas) already means “thou saidst,” for the
pronoun is included in and forms part of the verb. If therefore the
pronoun σύ (su), thou, is used as well, it makes it very emphatic; and
indeed it places all the emphasis upon the pronoun (thou) instead of
on the verb (sayest) and causes the phrase to mean “thou (and not !)
hast said it,” or It is thou that madest the statement, or Thou hast said
it thyself. So clear is this emphasis that the words “and not I” are often
added.* [Note: Euripides and Sophocles both have examples. See
Wetstein. And compare Mat. 27:11. Mar. 15:2. Luk. 22:70; Luk. 23:3.
Joh. 18:37; (and Sept. Exo. 10:29).] So, too, σὺ λέγεις (su legeis),
thou thyself dost allege.

See, eg., Mat. 26:25 : “Then Judas, which betrayed him,
answered and said., Master, is it 1? He said unto him, Thou hast said it
thyself,” not I. Thou hast taken the fatal word “traitor” on thine own
lips.

So, in Mat. 26:63-64, the High Priest (before whom Jesus had held
his peace) asked, “Tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus saith unto him, “Thou hast said it thyself,” not |. | neither affirm it
nor deny it. Thou hast spoken the word. But then not to leave the
matter in further suspense, Jesus says: “Only, | tell you, hereafter ye
will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming
upon the clouds of heaven.”

It has been suggested that σὺ εἶπας (su eipas), thou saidst, should
be read in the text of Mat. 16:18, instead of σὺ εἶΠέτρος (su е! Petros),
thou art Peter.

But this is merely an invention to get out of a supposed difficulty. It
is based on the fact that in the most ancient MSS. there were no
divisions between the words, and hence it has been suggested that
the three words

ΣΥ ΕΙ ΠΕΤΡΟΣ (su εἰ Petros)
thou art Petros (i.e., Peter,-or a stone)
might originally have been written as one word,
ΣΥΕΙΠΣ (sueips),
and could be differently divided into two words, thus:-
ΣΥ ΕΙΠΣ (su eps, abbr. of ejpas)
thou saidst.
But against this are to be placed the following objections:
1. There are the Palrographical objections as to the suggested
abbreviations (a) of εἷρς for е/рез or eipas; (0) of ps for petros. The
only known ancient abbreviation of Petros or Peter is in one of the
Vienna Papyrus Fragments from Fay#lm, where it is written MET.
(pet.* [Note: See the Supplementum Nov. Test. Grrci, 1896, p. 67. By
Ed. Nestl', of Ulm] ), ie., the first three letters instead of the first and
the last.

2. There is the objection arising from the absence of definite ms.
authority, which makes the evidence conjectural rather than
documentary.

3. There is the objection arising from the actual context, which is
unquestioned; the two words “thou sayest” do not follow at all. Try it:
“And | say to thee, That thou saidst, and upon this rock | shall build My
Church.” It will be seen at once that the difficulty is increased instead
of being removed! Had the words been in the previous verse, the case
would be different; but, coming after the declaration in verse 17, and
especially after the formula, “And | also say to thee,” the words “thou
saidst’ seem to be quite impossible.

The best exposition of the passage is that which distinguishes
between the two words petros, a stone, a rolling stone, a stone for
throwing; and petra, a rock, or cliff, which cannot be moved.

Thou art a petros (a vacillating, unstable man, no one can build on
thee), but upon this petra (this rock which flesh and blood cannot
reveal, but which is revealed only by God Himself, upon Christ as “the
Son of God”), | shall build My Assembly.
And so it came to pass. For in Gal. 1:15-16 Paul says, “When it
pleased God ... to reveal His Son in me, that | might preach him
among the Gentiles; immediately | conferred not with flesh and blood”:
ie., | conferred not with those who know not all the truth involved in
preaching Christ as “the Son of God.” For all such are born of blood,
or of the will of the flesh, and they learn these truths only by Divine
revelation. We have the same word “reveal” in Mat. 16:17 (as we have
also “flesh and blood”) and Gal. 1:16, which is most significant. Paul
was the wise master-builder. Paul was the first to preach Christ as “the
Son of God,” as declared in Act. 9:20. This therefore was the petra-the
rock foundation of the Church of the living God; and no mere petros or
unstable man. Thus we have the contrast between the two, the petros
and the petra, the stone and the ROCK.

ix. Idioms arising from other Figures of Speech
Certain idiomatic phrases arise out of other Figures of Speech, and
they will be found, as scattered examples, throughout this work.

For example, Pleonasm gives rise to a few; but the following are
important, from Anthropopatheia. They will be found under that figure:

“To hide from one’s eyes.
To swear by one’s soul.
To hide one’s face.

To hide one’s eyes.

To spare with the eyes.
To stretch forth the hand.
To put forth the hand.

To shake the hand.

To make the hand heavy.
To make the hand light.
To withdraw the hand.

To turn the hand upon.
To lift up the hand.

To spread forth the hand.
To turn the hand back.
To smite or clap the hands.
To open the hand,”

etc. etc.

Synecdoche and Metonymy also give rise to the peculiar usage of
certain words in certain phrases: and these Figures must be referred
to, as it is unnecessary to repeat them here.

x. Changes of Usage of Words, in the Greek Language
These may be added as another class: where the meanings of words
change in the course of centuries, even among the same people.

The Greek of the New Testament is, as we have seen, full of the
idioms of another language (Hebrew). But there is more than this.
Greek is a language which was spoken and used by different races
under different conditions at different times and in different countries.

In the interpretation of Scripture, we have to take into account the
fact that Greek was a living language, and was consequently marked
by constant gradual changes. The New Testament Greek is four
centuries later than Attic Greek. It is, therefore, impossible for us to
depend solely on Attic Greek for its understanding and meaning.

Examples could be given of these changes:-

ζωοτπεῖν (z66poiein) which meant in classical Greek to produce
live offspring, had changed to preserve alive or make alive, to quicken.

πάροικος (paroikos) which meant neighbour, had come to mean
Sojourner.

πράκτωρ. (praktér) which meant tax-gather, had come to mean
Jjailor (Mat. 5:25. Luk. 12:58). We learn this from the use of the word in
the recently discovered Раруп.

On the other hand, Modern Greek exhibits similar changes of New
Testament Greek: e.g.,

Χρόνος which meant time, is used to-day in Greece of a year.

καιρός which meant season, is to-day in Greece used of weather.
It is clear therefore that any correct interpretation of New
Testament Greek must take into account, not only particular usages,
but also changes of usage. This properly comes under /diom, and
forms one of its most interesting and important branches. Biblical
Greek occupies an unique position, and has never yet secured the
attention and study which it demands. It is a neglected study, and is
destitute alike of Lexicon and Grammar.* [Note: The late Professor
Hatch, of Oxford, has shown the importance of this branch of Biblical
study, and laid the foundations for it in his Essays in Biblical Greek.
Clarendon Press, 1889.]

We can, here, give only a few examples of the idiomatic usage of
certain important Greek words in the New Testament, which had been
changed from their original classical meaning, and were used in a
different Biblical sense. It is clear that many words which had been
used by heathens could not possibly be brought into use in the sphere
of spiritual and Divine truths without considerable modifications, and,
in some cases, important changes.

The same phenomenon is encountered to-day, wherever the
attempt is made to translate the Bible into a heathen language.

The knowledge of these changes as they affect the more important
theological words is absolutely necessary to the correct interpretation
of the New Testament Scriptures.

Dr. Hatch gives (among others) the following instructive
examples:-

ἀγγαρεύειν (angareuein). In classical Greek it was used with strict
reference to the Persian system of mounted couriers (Herod. 8. 98.
Xen. Cyr. 8. 6, 17).

But the customs of other countries changed the meaning to the
forced transport of military baggage (Jos. Ant. 13. 2, 3. Epictetus,
Diss. 4. 1, 79).

In the New Testament, therefore, it is used of being compelled to
carry the load or baggage of another person. See Mat. 5:41; Mat.
27:32. Mar. 15:31. Compare Luk. 3:14.

ἀναγινώσκειν (anaginéskein) meant originally to persuade; then, to
know well, to gather exact knowledge of, hence to read.

But later usage extended the reading to reading aloud with
comments so as to persuade others. (See Epictetus, Diss. 3. 23, 20
and 1. 10, 8).

So in the New Testament (Mat. 24:15. Mar. 13:14), “Let him that
readeth” means let him who reads and comments on these words in
the assembly take care to understand them.

It explains also 1Ti. 4:13.

atrootopatiZelv (apostomatizein). Its classical use was to dictate to
a pupil what he was to learn by heart and afterwards recite.

But its later use was widened to the examination by questioning as
to what had been already taught (Pollux 2. 102).

Hence in Luk. 11:53, where it is rendered “provoke him to speak,”
it means they began to put questions to Him as if they were
questioning a pupil.

ἀρετή (aretee) in classical Greek meant excellence of any kind,
especially of manly qualities. Hence, Latin, vir-tus, manhood, valour,
prowess, skill.

In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used
for the translation of 222 (héd), glory. Hab. 3:3. Zec. 6:13.

Also of 2??? (thillah), praise. Isa. 42:8; Isa. 42:12; Isa. 43:21;
Isa. 63:7.
In the New Testament, therefore, it must have one of these two
senses. See Php. 4:8 (virtue). 1Pe. 2:9 (praises). 2Pe. 1:3 (virtue); 1:5
(virtue).

γλωσσόκομον (glé6ssokomon) was the case in which the tongues
(γλῶσσαι) of musical instruments were kept (fongue-case).

All trace of this vanishes in later Greek, and it was used of any
chest, especially of what we should call the strong-box, or coffer.
In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used
in 2Ch. 24:8; 2Ch. 24:10-11. See 2Ki. 12:9, etc., where we have
κιβωτός (kib6tos), of what we should call the money-box.

Hence its meaning and use in Joh. 12:6; Joh. 13:29.

δεισιδαΐµων (deisidaim6n) and δεισιδαιµονία (deisidaimonia) were
used of religion or religiousness in a good sense.

But in later Greek they were used in a bad sense; and this is the
sense in Act. 17:22; Act. 25:19.

διάβολος (diabolos) was used of slanderous or malicious
accusation.

In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used
with or without the article of a single person, like the Heb. 222,
Satan; and 22, Tsar. See 1Ch. 21:1. Est. 7:4; Est. 8:1. Psa. 109:6
(LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , 109:6). (See
Num. 22:22, where opposition is the meaning without implying
accusation of any kind.)

In the New Testament it is used as a proper name, except in 1Ti.
3:11. 2Ti. 3:3. Tit. 2:3, where it is used as an adjective, and in its
ordinary sense of malicious accuser.

διαθήκη (diatheekee). In classical Greek it had two meanings: (1) a
last will or testament, and (2) very rarely, of a covenant.

In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] itis used
280 times, and always of a covenant. This is its only use in the New
Testament, and though it is translated “testament” several times, it
should always be covenant. For Heb. 9:16-17, see under Ellipsis.

Dr. Hatch observes that “the attempt to give it in certain passages
its classical meaning of ‘testament’ is not only at variance with its use
in Hellenistic Greek, but is probably also the survival of a mistake: in
ignorance of the philology of later and vulgar Latin, it was formerly
supposed that ‘testamentum,’ by which the word is rendered in the
early Latin versions as well as in the Vulgate, meant ‘testament’ or
‘will,’ whereas in fact it meant also, if not exclusively, ‘covenant.’ ”

θρησκεία (threeskeia) was used (in the pl. [Note: |. The Plural
Number.] ) by Herodotus (2. 37) of external ceremonies of the
Egyptian priests.

In Biblical Greek it is not used of these, but is transferred to any
similar ceremonial observances and to these only: not of Christianity,
but of that which has its origin in feelings or experiences, or of piety.
This is its meaning in Act. 26:5 (“religion”). Col. 2:18 (“worshipping”).
Jam. 1:26-27 (“religion”).

µυστήριον (musteerion) always rendered or rather transliterated
“mystery”; but meaning a secret. See a pamphlet on The Mystery, by
the same author and publisher.

οἰκονόμος was used of managing a household, hence manager.

But in later Greek it was specially used of a slave who gave the
other slaves their rations. So Luk. 12:42. Gal. 4:2. Also of a land-
steward, or as we should say an “agent.” Luk. 16:1; Luk. 16:3; Luk.
16:8. Rom. 16:23.

πειράζειν (peirazein) usually translated to tempt: and πειρασμός
(peirasmos), temptation.

The classical use of the verb was to make proof or trial of (Homer,
Od. 16. 319; 23. 114; 9. 281). To make an attempt (Polyb. Fr. hist. 60).

In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] the
meaning was extended to the mode of trial: viz., by affliction or
disaster. Hence “trial” came to mean trouble: as being that which most
effectually tries anyone.
In the New Testament there are several passages where this
sense of tribulation, trouble, and even chastisement and persecution
are the more suitable renderings:-

Luk. 8:13 (Mat. 13:21. Mar. 4:17).
Mat. 6:13 (Luk. 11:4) Bring us not into trial, but deliver us from him, or
that, which does the mischief.
Mat. 4:1 (Mar. 1:13. Luk. 4:2) to be tried or afflicted by the devil
(hence Heb. 4:15).

Act. 20:19 -“Perils”: i.e., hardships through the plots and conspiracies
of the Jews (2Co. 11:24; 2Co. 11:26). Heb. 2:18. 1Pe. 1:6; 1Pe. 4:12.
Rev. 3:10.

πονηρός (poneeros) is defined by Aristotle as being only weak,
having a good-will, and therefore only “half-wicked,” because what is
done is not done from malice.

On the contrary in the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.).] , the meaning seems to point to the activity of mischief: of wild
beasts (Gen. 37:20. Eze. 14:15): of the plagues of Egypt (Deu. 7:15):
of blood-shedding (Isa. 59:7): of violence and mischief (Isa. 35:9; Isa.
10:1).

So in the New’ Testament, active harmfulness and
mischievousness are the prevailing meaning. Mat. 5:11; Mat. 5:39;
Mat. 6:13; Mat. 22:18 (Mar. 12:15. Luk. 20:23). Mat. 12:45 (Luk.
11:26).

In some of the apocryphal books, the sense seems to be that of
grudging (Sir. 14:4-5; Sir. 31:23). See Pro. 23:6. Deu. 28:56. In the
New Testament this seems to be the sense in Mat. 6:19-24; Mat. 7:11
(Luk. 11:13); Mat. 20:15.

παράκλητος (parakleetos) meant in classical Greek merely called
to one’s aid, assisting, especially in a court of justice. Hence a legal
adviser or helper.

But this falls short of the meaning it afterwards obtained: viz., not
only of helping another to do a thing, but to help him by doing it for
him. № is used only in John of the Holy Spirit's help (by Christ) in
14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7. And of Christ’s help (by the Holy Spirit) in 1Jn.
2:1.

Trioti¢ (pistis), faith. In classical Greek, it meant, psychologically,
conviction: rhetorically, proof which brings about the conviction; and
morally, good-faith or mutual trust.

In Biblical Greek, there is added a fourth usage, which is,
theologically, an ideal virtue: viz., a full assurance (Rom. 4:20-21).
And, since it believes that, what God has said He will surely bring to
pass, therefore, its objects are also objects of hope as well as faith
(Heb. 11:1).

συκοφαντεῖν (sukophantein). This word meant originally an
informer, and was used of one who gave information against persons
who exported figs from Attica. Literally, a fig-shewer. Hence a
informer; especially with the view of extorting money, a black-mailer
(Xenophon, Mem. 2. 9, 4-6).

Hence in Biblical Greek it comes to have a wider range of
meaning, and is used for Hebrew words which mean {ο oppress; and
thus passed from black-mailing the rich, to the oppression of the poor
to extort money, etc.

So Gen. 43:18. (See Gen. 26:20. Lev. 6:2. Deu. 24:14. Job. 10:3;
Job. 35:9. Psa. 72:4; Psa. 119:122; Psa. 119:134. Pro. 14:31; Pro.
22:16; Pro. 28:3; Pro. 28:16. Ecc. 4:1; Ecc. 5:7; Ecc. 7:8. Eze. 22:12;
Eze. 22:29. Jer. 6:6.)

In the New Testament it is used only in Luk. 3:14; Luk. 19:8.

The distinction between the following words in classical and
Septuagint and New Testament Greek is not observed in the
Translations:-

πένης (penees) is poor, as opposed to rich: one who has to
work for his living.

TITWXOG (ptéchos) is destitute, and in want: a pauper, or
beggar.
πραῦς (praus) is easy-tempered, as opposed to ὀργίλος
(orgilos), passionate; and πικρός (pikros), bitter or sour.
ταπεινός (tapeinos) is dejected as well as lowly.
In the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] these
words are used interchangeably to represent the same Hebrew words,
and do not denote inferiority in morals, but only in outward condition:
viz., the peasantry (fellahin), who lived quiet, peaceful lives, and were
the victims of lawless and powerful oppressors, who plundered and ill-
treated them.

See Psa. 10:9; Psa. 12:5 (6); 34:6; 35:10; 37:14; 40:17 (18); 72:4,
13; 76:9 (10); 147:6.

This is the sense underlying these words in the New Testament.

Professor Deissmann* [Note: Bibelstudien, Marburg, 1895, and
Neue Bibelstudieu, 1897.] has recently illustrated many New
Testament idiomatic usages and expressions from the collections of
papyri at Berlin and Vienna. They were recently discovered in Egypt,
and are of the age of the Ptolemies. They consist of petitions, letters,
receipts, accounts, divorces, bribes, etc. His contention is that these
contain marks, not of what is called “New Testament Greek,” but of the
vernacular usage of words at that time: e.g., he shows that νεόφυτος
(neophytos) novice (1Ti. 3:6) is used in the papyri of newly planted
palm trees.

ἀθέτησις (atheteesis), disanulling (Heb. 7:18; Heb. 9:26) is used as
a technical legal expression, and is often found with ἀκύρωσις
(akurésis) a depriving of authority, and in Antithesis to βεβαίωσις
(bebaidésis), a confirming, or establishing.

аматёртто) (апаретрб), to send up (Luk. 23:7; Luk. 23:11; Luk.
23:15. Act. 25:21) is used of sending up to a superior authority.

ἀπέχω (apech6é), to have in full (Mat. 6:2; Mat. 6:5; Mat. 6:16. Luk.
6:24) is used in two Еау т receipts dated respectively: Dec. 29th, 44
a.d., and Sept. [Note: ept. The Septuagint Version.] 6th, 57 a.d., of
giving a discharge for an account. This gives an ironical turn to these
passages. See also Php. 4:18.

ἐπίσκοποι (episcopoi), overseers (A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , bishops), is used
of civil functionaries in Rhodes, in the first centuries, both b.c. and
a.d.; and also of an official in the temple of Apollo.

πρεσβύτεροι (presbyteroi), elders, is used of civil functionaries in
Egypt, and also of temple officials, in the Fay#m papyri.

σφραγίζω (sphragiz6), to seal, is used of certifying as correct. This
may explain Rom. 15:28. Joh. 3:33. 2Co. 1:22. Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30.

ἄμετανοητος (ametanoeetos), impenitent (Rom. 2:5) occurs in a
papyrus record of a sale, denoting that there was to be no change in
it.

βιάζοµαι (biazomai), suffer violence (Mat. 11:12), is usually taken
as passive, but a Lycian inscription uses it as a deponent: i.e., the
kingdom of God presses itself on the notice of men.

δοκίµιον (dokimion), the trying (1Pe. 1:7). This usage would render
Jam. 1:3, “What is genuine in your faith.”

ἀρετή (aretee), 1Pe. 2:9, “That ye should show forth the praises of
him who hath called you.” And 2Pe. 1:3, “Him that hath called us to
glory and virtue.”

Inscriptions are quoted from the Egyptian papyri, which show that
ἀρετή was used at that time in the sense of a display of power. And
this is exactly what it means in the above passages; for God’s
wondrous power is displayed and manifested forth in His calling of His
People. See Eph. 1:18-19. (See above, page 851).

xi. Changes of Usage of Words in the English Language
It is most important that these should be carefully noticed: otherwise
many words and expressions in the English of the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] cannot
be understood.
It is most instructive to observe the evidence afforded by many of
these changes as to the constant effect of fallen human nature; which,
in its use of words, is constantly lowering and degrading their
meaning:

“All to brake” (Jdg. 9:53). This is an old Anglo-Saxon word
tobrecan, from which the prefix “to” has got separated. It means
altogether or completely smashed. (See Spenser’s Faerie Queene: 4.
7. 66; Milton’s Comus 379, “all to ruffi’d.” So that “all to” meant
“altogether’).

“And if’ (Mat. 24:48. 1Co. 7:11). “But and if’: i.e., but even if.

“A work” (2Ch. 2:18).

“A fishing” (Joh. 21:3). The “a” is a softening down of the Anglo-
Saxon “on”: “on sleep” (Act. 13:36).

“Away with” (Isa. 1:13) meant fo tolerate.

“By and by” (Luk. 21:19) meant immediately.

“Come at” (Num. 6:6) meant to come near, as in R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.]
“Company with” (1Co. 5:9. Compare v. 11) meant to have
company with, as in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : 18., to
associate with.

“Do to wit’ (2Co. 8:1) meant make to know (see “Wit” below): to
certify.

“Fetched a compass’ (2Ki. 3:9) meant to make a circuit, or round-
about course (as in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ). So Act.
28:13.

“For to do” (Deu. 4:1) Here, the “for” was used in the sense of “in
order that”. i.e., that ye may do.

“Full well” (Mar. 7:9): i.e., with full knowledge.

“Go to” (Jam. 4:13) meant come now.

“On sleep” (Act. 13:36). The “on” has now become softened in
modern usage to “a”-asleep.

“Presently” (1Sa. 2:16. Pro. 12:16. Mat. 21:19; Mat. 26:53. Php.
2:23) meant immediately.

“Prevent” (Psa. 59:10 (11); Psa. 79:8; Psa. 88:13 (14); Psa.
119:148. 1Th. 4:15) meant to go or come before, precede. See under
Ellipsis, Psa. 12:6 (7).

“Strike hands” (Job. 17:3) meant to conclude a bargain by
shaking hands.

“Trow’ (Luk. 17:9) meant to suppose or imagine (A.S., treowian, to
believe).

“Wit” or “to wit” (Gen. 24:21. Exo. 2:4) meant to know. Hence it
came to mean any special cleverness (as a noun), and then humour.
So “wof’ meant to know (Act. 3:17. Rom. 11:2, etc.), and “witty” (Pro.
8:12) meant simply skilful or clever, and “wittingly’ (Gen. 48:14)
knowingly, skilfully.

“Wist” (Mar. 14:40) is the past tense of wit, knew. “Unwittingly’
(Jos. 20:3) meant unknowingly. R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] margin, through error.

“Whit” (1Sa. 3:18. 2Co. 11:5). This is the Anglo-Saxon, wiht, a
person or thing; hence “not a whit’ meant not at all.

“Very” (Gen. 27:21. Pro. 17:9. Joh. 7:26; Joh. 8:4) meant true,
real.

So there are certain words which have changed their meaning in
the course of years:-

“Advisement” (1Ch. 12:19) meant deliberation: from the Latin ad,
to, and visum, seemed good).

“Adventure” (Deu. 28:56. Act. 19:31) meant to venture to go.

“Artillery” (198. 20:40). This meant (from the Low Latin artillaria,
any warlike weapons, hence) bows and arrows. To-day we confine the
word to quite another class of weapon.

“Assay” (Job. 4:2) meant to attempt, to try.

“Beeves” (Num. 31:33, etc.) was the plural of “beef”: the Norman-
French for ox.

“Bonnet” (Exo. 28:40) was at one time used of a man’s
headdress: and is still so used in Scotland.

“Brigandine” (Jer. 46:4; Jer. 51:3) was a coat of mail. Now we use
the word brigand in a special sense.

“Carriages” (Act. 21:15). From the three voices of the Greek Verb
we have Carriage (passive: i.e., that which | carry): Carry (middle: i.e.,
how | carry myself); Carriage (active: i.e., that which carries me). The
former of these uses of the word (from the Passive) is now obsolete.
“Clouted” (Jos. 9:5) meant patched. And “Clouts” (Jer. 38:11-12).

“To ear” (1Sa. 8:12. Isa. 30:24) meant to plough (from Anglo-
Saxon erian, to plough). So the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] now renders it; in 1Sa. 8:12, spelling it “plow,” but in Isa. 30:24,
“till.” Compare Gen. 45:6, “Neither earing nor harvest.” Exo. 34:21.
Deu. 21:4.

“Earing” (Gen. 45:6. Exo. 34:21) meant, as in R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] , plowing.

“Eared” (Deu. 21:4) meant ploughed.

“Earnest” (2Co. 1:22. Eph. 1:14) meant a pledge; but differing
from an ordinary pledge in this, that while a pledge might be of a
different kind, the earnest was a pledge of the same kind.

“Fast” (Rth. 2:8) was used in the sense of close, near.

“Fat” (Joe. 2:24. Mar. 12:1) was used for a Vat, from Anglo-Saxon
faet, which was pronounced vat.

“Goodman” (Mat. 20:11) meant householder (as in Π.Ν. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] ).
“Libertines” (Act. 6:9), a class of freedmen amonst the Romans.

“Lusty” (Jdg. 3:29) meant merely vigorous; and Lust meant simply
pleasure or desire generally, as Exo. 15:9. Deu. 12:15, etc. 2Ti. 4:3 :
Joh. 8:44. 1Jn. 2:16. Now we use it of one special form of desire.

“Mote” (Mat. 7:3) is the Anglo-Saxon mot, i.e., a particle of dust.

“Naughty” (Pro. 6:12; Pro. 17:4. Jer. 24:2) meant worth naught,
worthless. Now we use it of any evil, and sometimes of some special
form.

“Nephew” (Jdg. 12:14. Job. 18:19) meant a grandson. See Isa.
14:22. 1Ti. 5:4 from the Latin nepos.

“Occupy” (Luk. 19:13) meant fo carry on business, to trade, from
the Latin occupare, to lay hold of. Hence our word “occupation.”

“Outgoings,” Jos. 17:9. Psa. 65:8 (9), meant utmost limits.

“Penny” (Mat. 20:2) was used of any piece of money. Even silver
money used to be so called. Hence the phrase: “to turn a penny.” In
Icelandic, peningr means cattle, as well as money. Now it is limited to
a particular coin, which we represent by “d” (the initial of denarius). “A
penny a day” was the idiom for the ordinary wage for such labour. In
Luk. 10:35, the “two pence” equalled two days’ wages or double pay.

“Publican” (Mat. 9:10, etc., etc.) was the Latin Publicanus, a tax-
collector. Now the usage is changed to a Vintner.

“Quick” (Lev. 13:10; Lev. 13:24. Num. 16:30. Psa. 55:15; Psa.
124:3. Isa. 11:3. Act. 10:42. 2Ti. 4:1. Heb. 4:12. 1Pe. 4:5) is the Anglo-
Saxon cwic, alive, as opposite to dead. Now we use it in the sense of
lively as opposite to sluggish. So

“Quicken” means to make alive (Psa. 71:20; Psa. 80:18; Psa.
119:25; Psa. 119:37; Psa. 119:40; Psa. 119:88; Psa. 119:107; Psa.
119:149; Psa. 119:154; Psa. 119:156; Psa. 119:159; Psa. 143:11.
Rom. 13:11).

“Quickened,” made alive (Psa. 119:50; Psa. 119:93. 1Co. 15:36.
Eph. 2:1; Eph. 2:5. 1Pe. 3:18.

“Quickeneth,” maketh alive (Joh. 5:21; Joh. 6:63. Rom. 4:17. 2Co.
3:6 (тагд. [Note: arg. Margin.] ). 1Ti. 6:13.

“Quickening,” making alive (1Co. 15:45).

“Silly” (Job. 5:2. Hos. 7:11. 2Ti. 3:6) meant, originally, as Anglo-
Saxon, saelig, timely, then, happy, and innocent. But now, because a
person who acts thus is supposed by the world to be foolish, so it has
come to be used. The same is the case with the word

“Simple,” which meant, originally, without guile, open, artless. But
now, because a person who acts thus, is considered devoid of all
sense, it has come to mean foolish. In the Bible the word is used in its
original sense, as the usage had not then changed. See Psa. 19:7 (8);
119:6; 119:130. Pro. 1:4; Pro. 1:22; Pro. 1:32; Pro. 7:7; Pro. 8:5; Pro.
9:4; Pro. 9:13; Pro. 14:15; Pro. 14:18; Pro. 21:11; Pro. 22:3. Eze.
45:20. Rom. 16:18-19.
“Simplicity” is used in the corresponding sense: 2Sa. 15:1. Pro.
1:22. Rom. 12:8. 2Co. 1:12; 2Co. 11:3.

“Sottish” (Jer. 4:22) meant stupid, dull, heavy. Now, because а
person is made so by drink, its use is limited to stupidity thus induced.

“Vagabond” (Gen. 4:12; Gen. 4:14. Act. 19:13. Psa. 109:10)
meant originally, a wanderer, from Latin vagari, to wander. But,
because those who thus wander, are generally compelled to do so on
account of their worthless character, so the word came to be limited to
this special sense.
