Gen. 4:4-5.-

а And the Lord had respect

b unto Abel and to his offering:
Ь But unto Cain, and his offering

а — he had not respect.
2Ch. 32:7-8.-

а — There be more with us

Ь — than with him;
Ь With him is an arm of flesh,

а but with us is the Lord our God.
Isa. 5:20.-“Woe unto them that call

evil
good, and
good
evil;
that put darkness
for light,
and light for
darkness;
that put bitter
for sweet,
and sweet for
bitter.”
Isa. 55:8.-
а — “For my thoughts
b — аге not your thoughts,
Ь neither are your ways
а my ways, saith the Lord.”
In verse 9 these words are in their natural order.
In verses 8 and 9 taken together, the figure is a simple Epanodos:
а “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
Ь Neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
Ь — For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my
ways higher than your ways,
а and my thoughts than your thoughts.”
Here in a and a we have “thoughts”; while in b and b we have
“ways.”
Further, there is another involved Epanodos in b and b, between
the “my” and “your”; as there is between a and b.
Mar. 2:27.-
а “The sabbath
b was made for man,
Ь — апа not man for
а — е sabbath.”
Joh. 8:47.-
а “He that is of God,
Ь heareth God's words,
Ь — уе therefore hear them not (i.e., the words)
а because ye are not of God.”
Joh. 15:16.-
а “Ye have not chosen
Ь — me,
b but!
а have chosen you.”
Joh. 14:17.-“Even the Spirit of Truth;
а whom the world cannot receive,
Ь because it seeth him not,
ο neither knoweth him:
с but ye know him;
Ь for he dwelleth with you,
а and shall be in you.”
Here the words are not repeated in b and c, but the fact is stated
as to seeing and receiving
1Co. 11:8-9.-
а “Forthe man
Ь — 6 not of the woman;
Ь but the woman
а of the man.
ο. Neither was the man created
@ — for the woman,
а — but the woman
ο. for the man.”
Gal. 5:17.-
а “The flesh lusteth
b against the spirit,
Ь — апа the spirit
а against the flesh.”
1Jn. 2:18.-
a___Last time (little children)
Ь Antichrist to come (and as)
Ь — тапу come (even now)
а — last time (whereby).
2Jn. 1:6.-
а “This is love, that we walk
b — айег his commandments.
b_ This is the commandment,
а that... ye should walk in it.”
3Jn. 1:11.-
а “Follow not that which is evil,
b but that which is good;
Ь — He that doeth good is of God,
а but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.”
Other examples of introverted parallelism (of lines) may be studied
in Gen. 12:16. Deu. 16:5-6; Deu. 28:1-2. 1Sa. 1:2; 1Sa. 25:3; 2Sa.
3:1. 1Ki. 16:22. Pro. 30:8-9. Isa. 56:3-7. Joe. 2:18-21; Joe. 2:30-31.
Mic. 3:12; Mic. 4:1-2. Zec. 9:5. But they are to be found everywhere,
and they abound in the Psalms.

These examples Will be sufficient to explain and illustrate the
figure and show its importance.
