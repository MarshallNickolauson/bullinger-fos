Palinodia; or, Retracting
Approval of one Thing after reproving for another Thing

Pal’-i-noédd’-i-a. Greek, TraAivwoia, a song repeated a second time;
hence a retracting of a former one.

The Figure is used when, having spoken against or reproved any
person or thing, we speak well of him or it.

Examples may be found in some of the Epistles to the Seven
Churches.

Ephesus: Rev. 2:6, after the reproof of verses 4 and 5.

Sardis: Rev. 3:4; Rev. 5:1-14, after the reproof of verse 1.

In the Old Testament, examples may be seen in 2Ch. 15:17; 2Ch.
19:3. Psa. 89:33; Psa. 106:8; Psa. 106:44.
Prolepsis (Occupatio); or, Anticipation

The answering of an Argument by anticipating it before it is used
Pro-leep’-sis. Greek, TpOANWic, a taking beforehand, from πρό (pro),
beforehand, and λαμβάνειν (lambanein), to take or receive.

This is a beautiful figure; by which we anticipate objections to what
we are stating.

The other general names of this figure are:

PROCATALEPSIS (Pro -cat-a-leep-sis). Greek, προκατάληψις, а
seizing beforehand, pre-occupation.

APANTESIS (Ap -an-tee’-sis). Greek, ἁπάντησις, a meeting;
hence a meeting of an objection by anticipation.

The Latins called it:

OCCUPATIO, anticipation.

ANTEOCCUPATIO, anticipation beforehand.

PRMONITIO, a defending beforehand, obviating objections.
