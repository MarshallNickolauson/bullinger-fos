1. Where the Retraction is Absolute

Mar. 9:24.-“Lord, | believe; [but, remembering his weakness, the
speaker immediately corrects this great profession of faith, and says]
help thou mine unbelief.”
Joh. 12:27.-The Lord Jesus prays as perfect man, “Father, save me
from this hour: [and then, remembering, as perfect God, the work
which He had come to do, He adds] but for this cause came | unto
this hour.”

See under Metonymy.
Rom. 14:4.-“Who art thou* [Note: See under Apostrophe.] that
judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or
falleth. [And then, remembering the blessed fact of the security of
such an one, and the provision made for all his need, the Apostle
adds] Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him
stand.”

2. Where it is Partial or Relative

This phase of the figure has been called COLLATIO, Collation.
Pro. 6:16.-“These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an
abomination unto him.” See chap. 30:15, 18.

Mat. 11:9.-“But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? (and then, as
though correcting it and them, the Lord adds), yea, | say unto you,
and more than a prophet.”

Joh. 16:32.-“Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall
be scattered, every man to his own home.” (See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin.)

Then another Epanorthosis immediately follows:-

“and shall leave me alone; [with respect to men, but not with
respect to God. Therefore we have the Epanorthosis], and yet | am
not alone, because the Father is with me.”

Act. 26:27.-“King Agrippa, believest thou the prophet? | know that
thou believest.”
1Co. 7:10.-“And unto the married | command: yet not ! but the Lord.”

See also under Zeugma.

1Со. 15:10.-“I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but
the grace of God which was with me.”
Gal. 1:6.-“I marvel that ye are so soon removed ... unto another
(ἕτερος, a different) Gospel. Which is not another (ἄλλος, another of
the same kind).”
Gal. 2:20.-“Nevertheless | live: yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.”
See under Zeugma, Epanadiplosis, and Polyptoton.
Gal. 4:9.-“But now, after that ye have known God: or rather are
known of God.”
2Ti. 4:8.-“Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: [then
comes a beautiful Epanorthosis] and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love his appearing.”
1Jn. 2:2.-“And he is the propitiation for our sins: [then comes the
Epanorthosis, pointing out that He was the Propitiation for Gentiles as
well as Jews, so John adds], and not for our’s only, but also for the
whole world.”
See especially under Synecdoche and Metonymy.
3. Where it is Conditional
Gal. 3:4.-“Have ye suffered so many things in vain?-If it be yet in
vain.”
