Syncrisis; or, Repeated Simile

Repetition of a number of Resemblances
Syn~-cri-sis. Greek, σύγκρισις, from σύν (sun), together with, and
κρίσις (crisis), a judging or deciding.

Hence, Syncrisis is the judging or comparing of one thing with
another; and is used of the figure which consists of a repeated Simile,
or of more than one, or of a number of separate comparisons used
together.

Another name for this figure is PARATHESIS (Pa-rath’-e-sis),
Greek, παράθεσις, a putting beside; from παρά (para), beside, and
τιθέναι (tithenai), to place.

It was called by the Latins COMPARATIO: i.e., a bringing together
and comparing.

Isa. 1:18.-
“Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though they be red like crimson,
They shall be as wool.”

Isa. 32:2.-“And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, anda
covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land.”

Isa. 66:12.-“For thus saith the Lord, Behold, | will extend peace to her
like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream.”
