Job. 22:6.-“And stripped the naked of their clothing.”

Here the figure Synecdoche (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) turns the

phrase into a powerful Oxymoron.
Isa. 58:10.-“Thy darkness shall be as the noon-day.” See under
Antimetathesis.
Jer. 22:19.-“He shall be buried with the burial of an ass”: i.e., not
buried at all; he shall have an unburied burial! Compare 2Ch. 36:6,
and Jer. 36:30; and see under Enallage.

Mat. 6:23.-“If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great
is that darkness.”

How can light be darkness? The Oxymoron arises from the
Metonymy by which “light” is put for the human wisdom of the natural
man, which is darkness (Eph. 4:18).

Mat. 16:25.-“Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find it.”

So Mar. 8:35.

Act. 5:41.-“Rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
for his name.”

This may sound folly to the natural man, but those who have been
“made wise” understand it. The two contrary Greek words mark the
Oxymoron more emphatically:-KaTagioGo8ai (kataxiousthai), to be
accounted very worthy, and ἁτιμασθῆναι (atimastheenai), to be
treated as unworthy, or with indignity. (See under Metonymy).
1Co. 1:25.-“The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men.”

See under Parechesis, Metonymy (of Adjunct), and Catachresis.
1Co. 1:27-29 is a beautiful and elaborate Oxymoron; in order to
enhance the conclusion “that no flesh should glory in his presence.”
1Co. 9:17.-“If | do this thing willingly (ἑκών, without wages), | have a
reward (µισθόν, wages).”

See under Paronomasia and Meiosis.
2Co. 6:4; 2Co. 6:8-10.-“Approving ourselves as the ministers of God

As deceivers, and yet true;

As unknown, and yet well-known;

As dying, and, behold, we live;....

As chastened, and not killed;

As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;

As poor, yet making many rich;
As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.”
2Co. 8:2.-“Their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
liberality.”

This is a most elegant Oxymoron.
2Co. 12:10.-“When | am weak, then am | strong.”

This is folly to the natural man, but blessed truth to those who
know by experience the true wisdom.
2Co. 12:11.-“In nothing am | behind the very chiefest apostles, though
| be nothing.”
Eph. 3:8.-“Less than the least of all saints.” This pleasing Oxymoron
emphasises the apostle’s growth in grace (i.e., in his knowledge of
what grace was to him, and what it had done for him). Before this, (in
a.d. 60), he said: “I was not behind the very chiefest apostles” (20ο.
11:5) In a.d. 62, he could say that he was “less than the least of all
saints,” while, later than this, (a.d. 67), his knowledge of God’s grace
made him see himself as “the chief of sinners” (1Ti. 1:15-16). See
under Meiosis.
1Ti. 5:6.-“She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”
This Oxymoron arises from a latent Ploce (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]
), the word “dead” denoting the absence of spiritual life: “dead in
trespasses and sins.”
