An -ti-pros-o ‘-po-poe-ia. This is the name of the former figure with ἀντ

2Sa. 16:9.-“Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why
should this dead dog curse thy lord, the king? let me go over, | pray

The Ascribing of Human Attributes, etc., to God.
An-thrép‘-o-path-ei’-a. Greek, ἀνθρωποπάθεια, from ἄνθρωπος
(anthropos), man, and πάθος (pathos), affections and feelings, etc.
