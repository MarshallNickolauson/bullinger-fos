In Latin, therefore, the name is REPRSENTATIO, representation,
and ADUMBRATIO, a shadowing out or a sketching out in words.

Other Greek names of this figure are DIATYPOSIS (di’-a-ty-po-
sis), from διά (dia), through, and τυπιοῦν (typoun), to impress. The
verb meaning {ο form thoroughly, to give a thorough form.

ENARGEIA, ἐνάργεια (en-ar-gei-a), vivid description, visible
representation (in words).

PHANTASIA, φαντασία (phan-ta’-si-a), a making visible, a
presentation of objects to the mind-

ICON (εἰκών, eik?n), an image, figure, likeness; and Latin IMAGO,
an imitation, copy, or picture, but especially a statue, visibly presenting
the object to the eye or mind.

EICASIA. Greek, εἰκασία (ε{-ο8΄-5{-8), a likeness, or image, from
εἰκάζω (eikazo), to make like to, represent by a likeness.

Thus the nature of this figure is quite clear from the various names
given to it. Hypotyposis is employed whenever anything is so
described as to present it forcibly and vividly to the mind.

There are many examples in Scripture: but it is not necessary to
transcribe whole passages, and in some cases whole chapters, in full.

Examples may be classified, in which things are thus vividly
presented to the eye, and so described as to seem very real.

(1) The blessings on the obedience of Israel (Deu. 28:1-14).

(2) The curses and the judgments (Deu. 28:15-45. Isa. 1:6-9; Isa.
34:1-17. Jer. 4:19-31). The greater part of Lamentations (esp., 4:4-8).
(3) The captivity and scattering of Israel (Deu. 28:49-68).

(4) The executioners of God’s judgments (Isa. 5:26-30).

(5) The hollowness of mere religion, such as existed when Christ
was on earth (Isa. 1:11-15).

(6) The folly of idolators and idols and idolatry (Isa. 44:9-17; Isa.
46:6-7).

(7) The sufferings of Christ (Psa. 22:1-31; lix. Isa. 53:1-12).

(8) The glory and triumph of Christ (Col. 2:14-15, etc.).

(9) Certain similitudes: as when the blessings of Christ's coming
are compared to the rising sun (Mal. 4:2), or a warrior (Rev. 19:11-16);
or when God is compared to a wine-refreshed giant when He arises to
avenge His people (Psa. 78:65-66); or when the godly remnant of
Israel is compared to a Bride (Psa. 45:1-17); or when the prosperity of
the wicked is likened to a green bay-tree (Psa. 37:35); and that of the
righteous to the palm and the cedar (Psa. 92:12-14).
