IV. Inanimate things.

V. Kingdoms, countries, and states.

VI. Human actions, etc., attributed to things, etc.

i. The members of the human body

Gen. 31:35.-Heb., Let not the eyes of my lord kindle with anger.

So Gen 45:5 margin: and compare Isa. 3:8.
Gen. 48:14.-“He made his hands to understand” (222, sikkeyl),
skilful.
Deu. 13:8.-“Neither shall thine eye pity him.”
1Ki. 20:6.-“Whatscever is pleasant (or desirable, marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] ) in thine eyes”: i.e., pleases thine eyes. So Eze. 24:16 (see
under Periphrasis and Metonymy), 21 (see Paronomasia). 1Jn. 2:16.
Job. 29:11.-“When the ear heard me, then it blessed me and when
the eye saw me, it gave witness to me.” How beautiful is this
Prosopopria. № is more than putting the “eye,” by Metonomy, for any
one who used the eye and saw. It is the actual personification of the
eye; and, therefore, much more expressive.
Job. 31:7.-‘If ... mine heart walked after mine eyes,” i.e., if | covet that
which | have seen. Compare 1Jn. 2:16.
Psa. 35:10.-“All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee,” etc.

When it is written “All my bones,” it is the figure Synecdoche, by
which a part or some of the members are put for the whole being or
person. When it is written “shall say,” that is Prosopopria, because
they are represented as speaking.

This is a Psalm of David: and it is therefore true of David’s Son,
and David’s Lord, as well as of David himself.

David could say that he, with all his members and powers, used
these words and said, “Jehovah! Who is like unto thee,” etc.

The Lord Jesus could use them in like manner of Himself. But
there is a further application to Christ mystical: a truth not then
revealed. All the members of Christ's body now say exactly the same
thing. In Psa. 139:16 we see the formation of those members (1Co.
12:1-31). We see how they are placed in the Body.

They are “vexed.” Psa. 6:2 (3).

They are “sundered” (Psa. 22:14 (15), margin), but never “broken”
(Psa. 34:20 (21). Exo. 12:46): therefore Christ's literal bones were not
to he broken (Joh. 19:33; Joh. 19:37).
Their “hearts” are broken, as His was (Psa. 69:20). See Psa. 34:18
(19), (and cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] verse 20), but they
themselves, never!

They all are “poor and needy,” and they all say one thing. They all
own Jesus as “the Lord”; and all confess that there is none like Him.
Sometimes they ask the question (Psa. 89:6 (7); 71:19. Exo. 15:11),
and sometimes they answer it (Deu. 33:26-27. 1Sa. 2:2).

They thus confess Him as beyond compare, because He delivers
the “poor and needy” from the strong spoiler.

From the Law which was too strong (Gal. 3:10; Gal. 3:13).

From Sin which is too strong (Rom. 7:23-24; Rom. 5:21).

From the World which is too strong (Joh. 16:33), and

From Death (2Co. 1:10. 2Ti. 1:10. Hos. 13:14).

Psa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.”
Here, Ethiopia is first put, by Metonymy (of subject), for the inhabitants
who lift up their hands. Otherwise, it is a Prosopopoeia, for Ethiopia
has no hands! This will be fulfilled in the day of Psa. 72:15.
Psa. 73:9.-“Their tongue walketh through the earth.” It is the wicked
who walk through the earth, using their tongues against God.

Psa. 103:1.-“All that is within me, bless his holy name.” See also
Synecdoche and Idiom.

Psa. 119:82.-“Mine eyes fail for thy word”: ie., mine eyes are
consumed in looking for the fulfilment of Thy Word: ie. (by
Synecdoche) | am consumed. So verse 123.

Psa. 137:5 (6).-“If | forget thee, О Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.”
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supply “her
cunning” in italics. This is usually treated as an Ellipsis, but by some
85 a Prosopopoeia. But it is neither. When the correct reading of the
Hebrew is understood, we have here a beautiful Paronomasia (q.v.
[Note: Which see-] ), and the reading is “let me forget my right hand.”
Psa. 145:15.-“The eyes of all wait (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ‚ look
unto) thee.”

Pro. 10:32.-“The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom.”

Isa. 13:18.-“Their eye shall not spare children.”

Eze. 20:7.-“Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes.”
See under Enallage.
Mat. 6:3.-“Let not thy left hand know,” etc. See Paroemia.
2Ре. 2:14.-“Having eyes full of an adulteress.” (See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin.)
1Со. 12:15-16.-“If the foot shall say, Because | am not the hand, | am
not of the body; Is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say,
Because | am not the eye, | am not of the body; Is it therefore not of
the body?”
ii. Animals

Gen. 9:5.-“At the hand of every beast will | require it.” Beasts are thus
spoken of as intelligent and responsible. How much more man!
Job. 12:7.-“Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee: and the
fowls of the air, they shall tell thee.” Compare verses 8, 11, etc.
Job. 41:29 (21).-“He (leviathan) laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
Joe. 1:6.-“A nation is come up upon my land ... whose teeth are the
teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.” So verse
4.

Animals are represented as doing what the hostile nation had
done.
See further illustrations under Allegory.
iii. The products of the earth

Lev. 19:23.-“Ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised.” For
three years the fruit of a young tree was not to be eaten, but in the
fourth year it “shall be holiness of praises to Jehovah”: i.e., it shall be
counted holy to the great praise and glory of Jehovah. See Heterosis.
In the fifth year it might be eaten.
Joe. 1:10.-“The land mourneth-the oil languisheth.” So Isa. 16:8. Nah.
114.
Hab. 3:17 (margin).-“The labour of the olive shall lie.” So Hos. 9:2.
iv. Inanimate things

Gen. 4:10.-“The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the
ground.” See under Heterosis.

So in verse 11. The earth is represented as opening her mouth to
receive the blood of Abel.
Gen. 42:9; Gen. 42:12.-“The nakedness of the land.”
Gen. 47:19.-Desolation is spoken of as the death of the land.
Exo. 19:18.-“Mount Sinai quaked as though with fear.”
Lev. 18:25; Lev. 18:28.-“The land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.”
“It spued out the nations.”
Deu. 32:42.-Arrows are said to be made drunk; and the sword is said
to devour. Compare Isa. 34:5-6. Jer. 46:10.

The four lines are as follows:-

а | will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
Ь And my sword shall devour flesh;
а drunk with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
b from the hairy head of the enemy (R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] marg [Note: arg Margin.] ).

Here a refers to the arrows mentioned in a: while Ь refers to the
work of the sword mentioned in b. See under Parallelism.
Jos. 24:27.-“This stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all
the words of the Lord which he spake unto us.”
Jdg. 5:20.-“The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.” See
under Homoeopropheron.
2Ki. 3:19.-Here, the figure is translated:-“And shall mar every good
piece of land with stones” The Heb. is grieve. (See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] )
Job. 3:9.-Let the night “look for light, but have [or see] none; neither
let it see the dawning of the day.” Heb., the eyelids of the morning.
(See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] text). So Job. 41:18 (10).
Job. 28:22.-“Destruction and death say, We have heard of the fame
thereof with our ears.”

Job. 31:38.-“If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
thereof weep.” (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] , complain. Marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ,
weep).

Job. 38:7.-“When the morning stays sang together, and all the sons of
God (i.e., the angels) shouted for joy.” The stars are also called on to
praise God in Psa. 148:3.

Psa. 19:1 (2).-“The heavens declare the glory of God.”* [Note: See on
the whole of this wondrous Psalm, The Witness of the Stars, by the
same author and publisher. Pages 1-6.]

Psa. 77:16 (17).-“The waters saw thee, О God, the waters saw thee;
they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.” (See under
Epizeuxis). Thus is the history of Exo. 14:1-31, powerfully and
beautifully expressed.

Psa. 96:11-12; Psa. 98:7-8 are beautiful examples of Prosopopoeia. It
is a figure, of speech: but it emphasises the rejoicing of the whole
creation of God, when Christ shall return to remove its curse, and
cause its groanings to cease.

Psa. 103:16.-“The place thereof shall know it no more.” Compare Job.
7:10; Job. 8:18, ete.

Psa. 104:19.-“The sun knoweth his going down.” So

Son. 1:6.-“The sun hath looked upon me.”

Isa. 3:26.-“Her gates shall lament and mourn”: i.e., after the eastern
custom. See Job. 1:20; Job. 2:13.

Isa. 5:14.-“Sheol hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
measure”: and this, to show the great mortality of that day.

Isa. 14:8.-“The fir-trees rejoice at thee.”
Isa. 14:9-11.-Dead people in the grave are represented as speaking.
And Sheol or the grave (margin) is represented as being moved and
stirred. That it is the grave is clear from the reference to the “worms.”
Isa. 24:4.-“The earth mourneth.” (See under Paronomasia). Similar
examples are seen in verse 7; 33:9. Jer. 4:28; Jer. 12:4. Lam. 2:8.
Hos. 4:3. Joe. 1:10. Amo. 1:2, etc.

Isa. 24:23.-“Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun
ashamed,” etc. And this, in order to emphasise the glory of the
presence of the Lord.

Jer. 51:48.-“Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein,
shall sing for Babylon”: i.e., the joy over her fall shall be great and
universal.

Isa. 55:12.-“The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you
into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.” And
thus is emphasised the universal joy of Israel in the coming day of her
glory, when Jehovah shall comfort her. So Isa. 49:13.

Jer. 31:15.-Rachel, long since dead, is represented as weeping. So
Mat. 2:18.

Lam. 1:4.-“The ways of Zion do mourn,” etc.This most elegant
Prosopopeeia graphically describes the desolation.
Eze. 32:21-22.-Dead people are represented as speaking out of
Sheol: i.e., the grave, as is clear from the whole context.

Verses 22-32 are about those who have been slain with the sword,
and are fallen and lying in their graves.
Hos. 2:22 (24).-See also this verse under Anaphora, Climax, and
Polysyndeton; and compare Deu. 28:23. Jer. 14:22, where the
heavens and the earth are said to give their substance, or withhold it,
by the hand of God. So Jon. 1:4.
Rom. 8:19.-“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God.” See under Metonymy (of Adjunct),
Ellipsis, and Epitrechon.
Rom. 9:20.-“Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
thou made me thus?”
Rom. 10:6-8.-“The righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this
wise,” etc.
Rev. 6:9-10.-The dead are represented as speaking, notwithstanding
it says that they had been slain.

For, after the Church shall have been taken away, the Remnant of
Israel will be dealt with and go through a “great tribulation” and suffer
great persecution. Many will be martyred and “beheaded for the
witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshipped
the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their
foreheads or in their hands” (Rev. 20:4).

In Rev. 6:9, this time of persecution is not yet over, and those who
have been slain are represented, by Prosopoposia, as speaking and
asking, How long it would be before the earth should be judged, and
their blood avenged. That this is not the language of the Church is
clear; for they address the Lord as Δεσπότης (Despotees): {9.,
Despot, Master, esp., a master of slaves. Despot (see Luk. 2:29. Act.
4:24. 2Pe. 2:1. Jud. 1:4). And not as Κύριος (Kurios), Lord, as the
Church always does.

They have “white robes” given to them, thus keeping up the
Prosopopesia.

The word “souls” is put for persons by Synecdoche (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]).

Moreover the dead do not speak.

See Psa. 115:17; Psa. 146:4, etc.

v. Kingdoms, Countries, and States
1. A whole people as an individual man
Isa. 1:5-6.-“Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more
and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the
sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but
wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.” (See under Hypotyposis).
Thus the whole Jewish nation is elegantly addressed as one man. See
verses 7-9.
Careful students of the Old Testament, especially in the original,
will find abundant instances of this Figure. See Isa. 7:20; Isa. 30:28,
etc.

2. A whole Nation is spoken of as a Man
Lam. 3:1 (2).-“l ат the man that hath seen affliction ... He hath led
me,” etc.

This is generally but wrongly taken of Christ. It is the figure by
which a People is personified.

Dan. 2:31.-“This great image ... stood before thee.”
3. A whole People or State as a Woman
Isa. 32:9-11.-“Rise up, ye women that are at ease;” etc.

Here the whole People is addressed as a class of women. So
chap. 3:18-26. Mic. 7:8-10, etc.

Idolatrous Israel is spoken of, and to, as an adulterous woman:
Jer. 3:1; Jer. 3:3-4; Jer. 4:30. Eze. 16:1-63 and xxiii. Hos. 2:1-23 etc.
This is based on such passages as Exo. 34:15-16. Deu. 31:16. Jdg.
2:17. Isa. 1:21; Isa. 57:3. Nah. 3:4. Isa. 23:15-17.
4. A City spoken of as a Mother (i.e., a metropolitan city)

2Sa. 20:19. See under Hendiadys.

See also for a city or People spoken of as a mother, Isa. 50:1.
Hos. 2:2. Eze. 23:2. Gal. 4:26.

5. Cities and Villages are spoken of as Daughters

Jos. 17:16. Num. 21:25. Jdg. 11:26, etc. See esp. Jos. 15:45; Jos.
15:47; Jos. 17:11; Jos. 17:16-17. 1Ch. 7:28-29; 1Ch. 18:1-2; 2Ch.
13:19; 2Ch. 28:18, etc.
Psa. 45:12 (13).-“The daughter of Tyre”: i.e., as explained by
Epexegesis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), the rich among the peoples.
Psa. 137:8.-The “daughter of Babylon.” It is possible that the ‘little
ones” of verse 9 may be small offshoots of Great Babylon, and not
literal infants.
Lam. 1:6; Lam. 2:1, etc.-The “daughter of Zion.”
Lam. 2:2.-The “daughter of Judah.”
Zec. 9:9.-“Daughter of Zion,” “Daughter of Jerusalem.”

And elsewhere often. See Isa. 1:8; Isa. 10:32; Isa. 16:1; Isa. 37:22.
Jer. 4:31; Jer. 6:2. Mic. 4:10; Mic. 4:13. Zep. 3:10; Zep. 3:14.
Jer. 31:4; Jer. 31:21.-Virgin of Israel.”

So chap. 18:13, and Amo. 5:2.

Sometimes “virgin” and “daughter” are combined. Isa. 23:12; Isa.
37:22; Isa. 47:1. Jer. 46:11. Lam. 2:13.

vi. Human Actions attributed to Things, etc.

Called SOMATOPCEIA (S6-mat-o-poe’-ia). Greek σωματοποῇα, from
σωμα (séma), a body, and ποιεῖν (poiein), to make. Hence, to make
like a body or person, as we speak of embodying.
Gen. 4:7.-“Sin lieth at the door.”

See Metonymy, by which “sin” is put for sin-offering, and this sin-
offering is a live animal represented as a person waiting at the door.
The Hebrew 22? (rahvatz) is specially used of animals.
Gen. 18:20.-“The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great.”

This is Prosopoposia, whereas in Jam. 5:4 we have it literally.
Gen. 30:33.-“So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to
come.”

See under Antimereia (of Adv.).
Exo. 18:8.-“All the travail that had found them.”

So Gen. 44:34. Num. 20:14. Deu. 31:17; Deu. 31:21; Deu. 31:29.
Job. 31:29. Psa. 116:3; Psa. 119:143.
Job. 16:8.-“My leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.”
Psa. 85:10 (11).-“Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and
peace have kissed each other.”
Isa. 59:12.-“Our sins testify against us.”
Isa. 59:14.-“Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth
afar off.”
Jer. 14:7.-“Our iniquities testify against us.”
1Co. 13:4-7.-Human actions are attributed to charity.
Jam. 1:15.-“When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.” See
under Climax.
Rev. 18:5.-“Her sins have reached unto heaven.”
Antiprosopopeeia; or, Anti-Personification
The opposite of Prosopopoeia; Persons represented as inanimate
things
