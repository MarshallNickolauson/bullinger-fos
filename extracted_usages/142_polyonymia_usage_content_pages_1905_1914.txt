DIVIDED.

These three words are interpreted by Daniel in verses 26-28, and
the fulfilment of them follows in verses 30, 31. See under
Paronomasia.

Polyonymia; or, Many Names
An Application of nigma to the Names of Persons or Places
Pol’-y-6-nym’-i-a. Greek, πολυωνυμµία having many names, or more
than one name: from πολύς (polys), many, and ὄνομα (onoma), a
name.

It is not uncommon for persons or places to be known by different

names.
In Mat. 15:39, for example, there is no Enigma, but merely a case
of two names for the same place: “The coasts of Magdala.” In Mar.
8:10, it is called “The parts of Dalmanutha,” Dalmanutha being the
name of the region and Magdala of the city. The former was general,
the latter was special.

In Mat. 8:28, the people are called Gergesenes; and in Luk. 8:26,
and Mar. 5:1, Gadarenes. Some suppose that these were either
different names of the same place, or two places forming one larger
place. It is a question also as to whether precisely the same event is
described in these places, or whether two similar events took place at
two different times.

So with the names of Esau’s wives, which have formed a great
subject for the attention of infidels.

It is clear from a comparison of Gen. 26:34; Gen. 28:9, that Esau’s
wives were three in number:

1. “The daughter of Elon the Hittite”; called Adah (Gen. 36:2); but
she also had another name, Bashemath (Gen. 26:34).

2. “The daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite”; called
Aholibamah (Gen. 36:2); but not the Aholibamah of verse 25, who was
her aunt (compare verses 2 and 25). She was called also Judith, and
in 26:34 this Judith is said to be the daughter of Beeri the Hittite. But
there is no contradiction in this, for Anah appears to have been called
Beeri, or the Spring-man, because he discovered the “hot-springs”
(see Gen. 36:24)* [Note: So the R.V., 2222 (Hay-ye-meem), from
22? (Hoom), to put in commotion, agitate (Deu. 7:23. Mic. 2:12. Psa.
55:3). The Syriac has “waters.” “Mules” are always 22222
(Pharahdeem), (2Sa. 13:29; 2Sa. 18:9. 1Ki. 10:25. 2Ki. 5:17. Psa.
32:9, etc.). The A.V. Translators followed an error of the Talmud.
Moreover, 222 (matzah), to find, means to happen on, not to invent.]
; not “mules,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.]
It is true that in Gen. 36:2, Anah, alias Beeri, is called “the Hivite,”
while in Gen. 26:34, he is called “the Hittite.” The latter is history, and
is therefore general; the former is genealogy, and is therefore more
precise. “Hittite” is the general term; “Hivite” is the special and more
particular term (compare Jos. 1:4. 1Ki. 10:29. 2Ki. 7:6; and Gen. 28:8,
when Esau’s Hittite wives are spoken of as “daughters of Canaan’).

3. The third wife was “the daughter of Ishmael,” and was called
Bashemath (Gen. 36:2), and Mahalath (Gen. 28:8).

When three persons are so carefully and minutely described, it is
preposterous for anyone to create a difficulty about the similar names,
when down to our own day precisely the same phenomenon
constantly occurs.

But this feature of Polyonymia is not what we are describing and
discussing here. There is no Enigma in these common aliases.

It is only when another name is given, because of some special
meaning, “dark” or “deep” in it, that it becomes a Figure, being used in
a figurative sense, having some important signification beyond what
appears upon the surface.

Gen. 10:10; Gen. 11:2.-“The Land of Shinar” is another name for
Babel or Babylon. Babylon must be intended by “the land of Shinar.” in
the prophecy of the “Ephah” (Zec. 5:11). Had the name Babylon been
used here it might have been urged that it was put by Enigma for
some other place; but, when “the land of Shinar” is used for Babylon it
can hardly be that, after this, Babylon can be used for some other
name by a double use of the figure.

Deu. 1:2; Deu. 1:44; Deu. 2:8, etc.-Edom is called Seir, and this was
afterwards known in the Jerusalem Targum as 2222, Gabla or
Gebal.

We have the name in Psa. 83:6 (7). “Gebal, and Ammon, and
Amelek”: i.e., Edom, Ammon, and Amelek-three of Israel's greatest
enemies at critical moments in the history of the Nation.
2Ki. 23:13.-The Mount of Olives is called “the mount of corruption,”
because of the idolatries connected with it.

Psa. 87:4; Psa. 89:10 (11). Isa. 51:9.-Egypt is called Rahab on
account of its pride 620, Rachab, having this signification). This
judgment of Egypt is in Isa. 30:1-14.
Isa. 14:4.-The Antichrist is called “the King of Babylon,” because he is
the end and final outcome of Babel.
Isa. 29:1.-Jerusalem is called Ariel, which means the Lion of God. It is
so called to denote its greatness, glory, and strength (cf. [Note: f.
Compare (for Latin, confer).] 258. 23:20. 1Ch. 14:22), and is thus put
in contrast with the woe here pronounced against it. (See under
Ellipsis, page 5).

Jer. 25:26.-“And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” Here
Sheshach is put for Babylon.

The subject is the cup of the fury of the God of Israel (verse 15).
Four classes of nations were to drink of it, and all at one time. (1)
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah (18). (2) Egypt, etc. (19). (3) The
mingled nations (20-22), and (4) the nations further off (23-25), and,
finally, “the king of Sheshach.” In Jeremiah “the times of the Gentiles”
are not within the scope of his prophecy. Nor in Ezekiel. Daniel, on the
other hand, fills in these present times, and makes but little reference
to what goes before or comes after, as in Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
The point is that the judgment of these nations takes place all at
the same time with that of “the king of Sheshach,” and that time is
veiled in the Enigma contained in this peculiar name. Babylon is
meant; and, according to the ancient Kabbalah, the last letter of the
alphabet was put for the first, and the penultimate for the second, and
the antepenultimate for the third, and so on. By which Enigma the
word “Sheshach” (029) spells Babel (29). So that the final
judgment upon the nations is yet future, when Babylon shall have
been restored, and when “Great Babylon” “comes into remembrance.”
See further under Paronomasia and Amphibologia.

Eze. 23:4.-Jerusalem is called “Aholibah”: i.e., my tabernacle is in her.
While Samaria (Israel) is called Aholah: i.e., his (own) tabernacle.
There is a depth of meaning, therefore, in each name.

Hos. 4:15; Hos. 10:5.-Bethel (the house of God, Gen. 28:19; Gen.
28:22) was made, by Jeroboam, a house of his idol (1Ki. 12:29).
Hence, God gives it another name, and calls it Beth-Aven: i.e., the
house of vanity.
Gnome; or, Quotation
6Πό΄-ππεθ. Greek, γνώµη, knowledge, understanding; also a means of
knowing. From γνῶναι (gnénai), to know.

Hence, the term Gnome is given to the citation of brief,
sententious, profitable sayings expressive of a universal maxim or
sentiment which appertains to human affairs, cited as well-known, or
as being of general acceptance, but without quoting the author’s
name.

In Pro. 1:2, they are called “words of understanding.” The
Scriptures, as Bengel remarks, are so “full of the best things, that
these constitute, as it were, certain continued sentiments openly set
forth in the form of gnomes.”

When these are applied to a certain person, time, or place; or to
individual cases; or are clothed with circumstantial particulars, the
figure is called NOEMA, vonua (no-ee-ma), (plural, NOEMATA), {9.,
sense, thought, that which is thought, from νοεῖν, to perceive.

When the author’s name is given, the figure is called CHREIA,
xpeia, chree’-a, use, usage, or usance, (from χράοµαι, chraomai, to
use).
