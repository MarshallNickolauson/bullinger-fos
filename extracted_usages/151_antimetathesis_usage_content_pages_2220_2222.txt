Rom. 11:18.-“Boast not against the branches. But, if thou boastest
[know thou that] thou bearest not the root, but the root [beareth] thee.”
Here the apostle is addressing “you Gentiles” as such: not the
saints of God.
Rom. 11:19.-“Thou wilt plead then, The branches were broken off,
that | might be grafted in.”

This was true as to the effect, but not as to the cause. It was what
a Gentile, as such, would say, but not what the Holy Spirit said. No!
On the contrary, it was “Because of unbelief they were broken off.”

And so he goes on to speak of the Gentiles by Antimetathesis,
greatly enhancing and intensifying the argument.
Rom. 14:15.-“But, if thy brother is grieved with thy meat.” Here, the
change of persons emphasises the point that it is “thy brother” in
Christ. Not merely а fellow-man, but thy brother's Christian
conscience, which is stumbled at thy eating that which has been
offered to idols.
1Co. 7:16.-Here, the individual husband and wife are singled out and
addressed, as though they were present.
1Со. 15:35.-Here, an objector is singled out: perhaps the actual words
of a known person are quoted and dealt with.
