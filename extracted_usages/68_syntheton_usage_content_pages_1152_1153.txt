Gen. 18:27.-“Dust and ashes.”
Psa. 115:13.-“Small and great.”
Act. 7:22.-Moses was “mighty in words and in deeds.”

There are many examples where certain words thus become
linked together by usage: e.g., “rich and poor,” “old and young,” “bread
and wine,” “meat and drink,” “babes and sucklings,” “sins and
iniquities,” “faith and works,” “God and man,” “thoughts and deeds,”
etc., etc.

The opposite of this Figure is Hendiadys (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ),
by which, though two words are used, only one thing is meant.

Here, in Syntheton, much more is meant than is expressed and
embraced by the conjunction of the two words.
