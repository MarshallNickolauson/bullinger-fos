1Pe. 4:3.-“Abominable idolatries’-abominable things: i.e., the worship
of idols.
Syntheton; or, Combination
A placing together of two Words by Usage
Syn’-the-ton. Greek, σύνθετον, from σύν (sun), together, and τιθέναι
(tithenai), to place. Hence, σύνθετος (synthetos) means put together.

It is used of this Figure because two words are by common usage
joined by a conjunction for the sake of emphasis, as when we say
“time and tide,” “end and aim,” “rank and fortune.”

It differs from Synthesis (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.]). And also from
Hendiadys, where only one thing is meant, though two are used (see
Hendiadys).

Gen. 18:27.-“Dust and ashes.”
Psa. 115:13.-“Small and great.”
Act. 7:22.-Moses was “mighty in words and in deeds.”

There are many examples where certain words thus become
linked together by usage: e.g., “rich and poor,” “old and young,” “bread
and wine,” “meat and drink,” “babes and sucklings,” “sins and
iniquities,” “faith and works,” “God and man,” “thoughts and deeds,”
etc., etc.

The opposite of this Figure is Hendiadys (q.v. [Note: Which зее.] ),
by which, though two words are used, only one thing is meant.

Here, in Syntheton, much more is meant than is expressed and
embraced by the conjunction of the two words.

Horismos; or, Definition
A Definition of Terms
Hor-is’-mos. Greek, ὁρισμός (horismos), a boundary, from opiZw
(horizo), to divide, mark out, settle, define. Hence, it is called
DEFINITIO, definition
It is the figure by which the meaning of terms is defined and fixed,
