An-teis’-a-g6‘-gee. Greek, ἀντεισαγωγή, a bringing in instead; from
ἀντί (anti), against or instead; sic (eis), in; ἄγειν (agein), to lead or
bring.

The figure is so called, because a question is answered by asking
another.

It is called also ANTICATALLAXIS (an -ti-cat’-al-lax’-is). Greek,
ἀντικατάλλαξις, a setting off or balancing of one thing against another
(as in trade).

The Greeks called it also ANTHUPOPHORA (an’-thu-poph -o-ra).
Greek, ἀνθυποφορά, a reply to an objection; from avti (anti), against,
ὑπτό (hupo), φέρειν (pherein), to bring.

Hence the Latin names of the Figure: COMPENSATIO,
compensation, and CONTRARIA ILLATIO, a bringing in against.

Jdg. 14:8.-The answer to Samson’s “riddle” is given in the form of a
question, and is thus an Anteisagoge. See under Enigma.

A beautiful example is furnished in
Mat. 21:23-25; where, when the chief priests and elders asked Christ
by what authority He acted; He said, “I also will ask you one thing,
which if ye tell me, | in like wise will tell you by what authority | do
these things.” He then goes on, in verse 25, to answer the question by
asking another.

In the answer of His enemies we have the Figure Aporia (q.v.
[Note: Which 5εε.]).
Rom. 9:19-20.-“Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find
fault? For who hath resisted his will?”

“Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?” See
below, under Prolepsis.
