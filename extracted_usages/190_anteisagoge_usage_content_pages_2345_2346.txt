Jdg. 14:8.-The answer to Samson’s “riddle” is given in the form of a
question, and is thus an Anteisagoge. See under Enigma.

A beautiful example is furnished in
Mat. 21:23-25; where, when the chief priests and elders asked Christ
by what authority He acted; He said, “I also will ask you one thing,
which if ye tell me, | in like wise will tell you by what authority | do
these things.” He then goes on, in verse 25, to answer the question by
asking another.

In the answer of His enemies we have the Figure Aporia (q.v.
[Note: Which 5εε.]).
Rom. 9:19-20.-“Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find
fault? For who hath resisted his will?”

“Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?” See
below, under Prolepsis.
