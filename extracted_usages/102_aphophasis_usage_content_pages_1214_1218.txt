Addition by graceful disclosure of what is professedly concealed
As-te-is“-mos. Greek, ἀστεϊσμός, clever talk, from ἀστεῖος (asteios), of

speaker adds some graceful language which discloses it.

It comes in here when it is used as an addition by way of
reasoning. We have included it also in Figures involving change,
where the application of words is affected by way of feeling. (See
below).
