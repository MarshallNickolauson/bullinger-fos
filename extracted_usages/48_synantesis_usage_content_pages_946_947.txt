Synantesis; or, Introverted Repetition
The Repetition of the same Sentences or Phrases in Inverse Order
Syn-an-tee-sis, from συναντάω (sunantaq), to meet face to face,
means a meeting.
It is similar to Epanodos and Antimetabole (q.v. [Note: Which see.]
), but differs from them in that it relates to the inverse repetition of
sentences and phrases rather than of single words.
See, for examples, under Parallelism and Correspondence, below.
5. Repetition of Subjects
Parallelism; or, Parallel Lines
The Repetition of similar, synonymous, or opposite Thoughts or Words
in parallel or successive Lines

This form of sacred writing has been noted from the earliest times. De
Rossi,* [Note: Kitto. Bib. Cyc. Ill. 702.] a learned Jew of the sixteenth
century, first published a mass of information on the subject in a
remarkable work, Meor Enajim (i.e., The Light of the Eyes). Bishop
Lowth translated chapter 60+ [Note: Lowth’s Translation of Isaiah,
Prel. Dis. p. xxviii. (15th Ed. 1857).] , which deals with the construction
of lines: and Bishop Jebb in his Sacred Literature extended the study.
But none of these got beyond Parallelism as it is applied to lines. This
has universally gone under the name of, and been treated as, Poetry.

It is a form of the figure Synonymia, by which the subject of one
line is repeated in the next line in different, but so-called, synonymous
terms.

Parallelism is of seven kinds: three simple and four complex:-

|. Simple.
1. Synonymous or Gradational.
