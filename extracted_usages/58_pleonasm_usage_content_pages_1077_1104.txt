The figure may affect words, or sentences. We have therefore
arranged the examples as follows:-
9000000 1, Words.
1. Certain idiomatic words.
2. Other words.
900000 I. Sentences.
1. Affirmative.
2. Negative.
|. Words
1. Certain idiomatic words
According to the Hebrew idiom (see under /diom), two nouns are often
used together, one of which appears to be redundant. Glassius* [Note:
Philol. Sac., Lib. i., Tract 1, Can. 38.] gives a list of certain words,
which are thus commonly used to enhance and emphasize the force
of the other noun. Not as an adjective; for in that case the figure would
be Enallage instead of Pleonasm. Some of these come under the
figures Synecdoche and Idiom (q.v. [Note: Which see.] )
The ten words are as follows:-
1. ΦρὕΗ (Pahneem), faces.
The word is always in the plural on account of the various features
of the face.

Gen. 1:2.-“And darkness was upon the faces of the deep,” {6., upon

the deep. But how much more forcible and emphatic the expression

becomes by the pleonasm.

Gen. 11:8.-“So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the

face of all the earth:” {6., all over the earth.

Gen. 16:8.-‘l flee from the face of my mistress Sarai,” instead of “from

my mistress.”

Gen. 23:3.-“And Abraham stood up from before his dead.” Lit., from

the face of his dead, i.e., from the presence of his dead wife.
Sometimes the word is omitted in translation:

Exo. 7:10.-“And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh,” Lit., before

the face of Pharaoh, i.e., before his very eyes.

Lev. 23:40.-“And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God.” Lit.,

before the face of the Lord your God, i.e., in His very presence.

Jdg. 11:3.-“Then Jephthah fled from his brethren.” Here the A.V.

[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,

1611.] has again omitted the word “face,” but in this case has put it in

the margin.
1Sa. 14:25.-“And there was honey upon the ground.” Lit., upon the
face of the ground, {6., spread out.
Isa. 14:21.-“That they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the
face of the earth with cities.”
Isa. 19:8.-“And they that spread nets upon the waters.” Lit., upon the
face of the waters.
Hos. 10:7.-“As the foam upon the water.” See margin, “the face of the
water.”
Amo. 5:8.-“And poureth them out upon the face of the earth.”

In the N.T., though we have Greek words, we have the same
Hebrew idiom.
Luk. 21:35.-“As a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
face of the whole earth.” Here the Pleonasm emphasizes the universal
character of the events connected with “the great Tribulation.”
Act. 3:19.-“That so there may come (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] ) times of refreshing from the presence (face) of the Lord.”
Act. 5:41.-“And they departed from the presence of the council.” Lit.,
the face о!
Act. 17:26.-“For to dwell on all the face of the earth.”
Rev. 12:14.-“From the face of the serpent,” {6., a great way off from
the serpent.
2. ФД (Peh), mouth.

This word seems to be redundant when used with the word
“sword”: “the mouth of the sword.” But this use of the Figure is to
emphasize the fact that it is not a mere sword, but a sword with its
sharp devouring edge, which is thus compared to a mouth.

Gen. 34:26.-“And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the
edge (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , Heb., mouth) of the sword.”

So also Exo. 17:13. Deu. 13:15. Eze. 6:11. Amo. 7:11. Luk. 21:24.
Heb. 11:34.

A sword with two mouths is a sword which devoured
exceedinglyand slew large numbers; Jdg. 3:16. Rev. 1:16; Rev. 3:13.
Heb. 4:12.

Other uses of the word are seen in
Gen. 43:7.-“We told him according to the tenor (Heb., the mouth) of all
these words”: i.e., all those things concerning which they had been
interrogated.

Num. 26:56.-“According to the (mouth of the) lot”: {6., according to
what the lot shall say or determine.

Pro. 22:6.-“Train up a child in the way he should go.”

Heb., in the mouth of his way: i.e., at the very mouth or entrance
on life, so that it may be determined in a direction of justice and
honesty, etc.

3. 6ρύη (Bahneem), sons or children
Gen. 11:5.-“The Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which
the children of men builded”: /.е., men viewed as the descendants of
Adam; the human race.
1Ki. 8:39.-“Thou ... knowest the hearts of all the children of men”: i.e.,
of all men, with emphasis on the “all.”
Ecc. 3:18.-“I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of
men.”

Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “I said in mine heart, /Е is
because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, etc.”
Here, the figure shows that the emphasis is on “men” in contrast to
“beasts.” “Yet | said in my heart respecting MEN, God hath chosen
them to show that they, even they, are like beasts.”

Psa. 36:7.-“How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings,” i.e.,
men in all ages-not merely men, as such, but men in all their
successive generations.

So also in the New Testament we find the same usage:

Mar. 3:28.-“All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men,” i.e., men
in all ages, as in Mat. 12:31.

Eph. 3:5.-“Which (i.e., the Mystery) in other ages was not made
known unto the sons of men:” i.e., to any human being.

It is according to this Figure or Hebraism that Christ is called “the
Son of Man,” as the man, the representative man, the man who had
been long promised as the seed of the woman; the man prophesied.
Therefore this title used of Christ usually has reference to that aspect
of His work as the appointed Judge of men (Act. 17:31). “The Son of
Man’ is therefore an emphatic dispensational title of Christ. It means
merely “man,” but with emphasis on all that the word means as used
of Christ and his dominion in the earth. See Mat. 10:23; Mat. 16:13;
Mat. 16:27-28. Mar. 2:28. Luk. 6:5. Joh. 3:14. etc., etc.

Ezekiel is often thus addressed by God (chap. 2, 1, 11, etc.), as
“son of man,” but in his case without the article.

See also Psa. 8:4 (the first occurrence); 144:3, etc.

In Psa. 127:4 (5) we have “children of the youth,” {6., young
children.

Joe. 3:6.-“The sons of Greece,” {6., Greeks.
Deu. 9:2.-“Sons of the Anakim”: i.e., Anakim.

The word in the plural means simply the name of the nation
viewed as descended from some progenitor: e.g., “children of Israel”:
ie., Israelites, “children of Ammon, Moab, etc.”

4. ЩН (Shem), name

(a) This word appears to be redundant in the phrase “the name of
God.” It means God Himself, and has greater emphasis than if the
simple word God were used.

Isa. 30:27.-“Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far”: i.e.,
Jehovah Himself.

Jer. 44:26.-“Behold, | have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord”:
i.e., by myself, by my own majesty, by all that my name implies.

Mic. 5:4.-“And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in
the majesty of the name of the Lord his God”; i.e., in the majesty of
Jehovah Himself.
Psa. 20:1 (2).-“The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the name of
the God of Jacob defend thee:” i.e., Jacob’s God Himself.

So also verse 7 (8), etc.
Psa. 113:1.-“Praise the name of the Lord”: i.e., “Praise Jehovah
Himself.”
(0) When used with the verb ЧША (karah), to call, it means
emphatically to name.

See Gen. 11:9; Gen. 19:22; Gen. 27:36; Gen. 41:51.

(c) The worship and profession of God is indicated by the phrases
“call upon the name of the Lord:” i.e., to worship Jehovah himself
(Gen. 4:26. Jer. 10:25).

“To love the name of the Lord;”

“To walk in the name of the Lord;”

“To praise the name of the Lord.”

All these expressions mean, by the figure of Pleonasm, to worship
and fear Jehovah Himself as opposed to self, and all other gods.

We have the same figure in the New Testament:-

Mat. 6:9 and Luk. 11:2.-“Hallowed be thy name”: i.e., “Let thy holy
majesty-thyself alone-be worshipped.”

Rev. 15:4.-“Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?”:
ie., fear and worship Thee Thyself.

Mat. 1:21.-“Thou shalt call his name JESUS”: i.e., shall call Him that
holy one Himself.

So Luk. 1:13; Luk. 2:21.

Rom. 10:13.-“Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved”: {6., not whosoever shall utter the name, but whosoever shall
be a true worshipper of God in Christ shall be saved.
So Heb. 13:15. Joh. 1:12; Joh. 2:23; Joh. 3:18, etc.
5. ЙГ (yaad), hand.

The word “hand” is used in various ways (both idiomatically and by
Metonymy, q.v. [Note: Which see.] ) to express the instrument by
which a thing is done; and this in order to put the emphasis on the fact
that the power did not lie in the instrument, but in him who used it.
Gen. 9:5.-It seems superfluous, but it is not. It emphasizes the fact
that it is God who requires punishment for shedding man’s blood, and
that he will use all and every instrument to accomplish His will.

Exo. 4:13.-“And he (Moses) said, O Lord (Adonai), send | pray thee
by the hand thou wilt send”: {6., by any agency except me!

1Sa. 17:37.-“The Lord that delivered me out of the paw (hand) of the
lion, and out of the paw (hand) of the bear, he will deliver me out of the
hand of this Philistine”: {6., the power of the lion, and the bear, and
Goliath. See Psa. 22:20 (21) (= the dog); 49:15 (16); 107:2. 1Ki. 11:12.
1Ki. 8:53.-“Thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant”: {6., by
Moses. Jehovah was the speaker, Moses was only the instrument.

So also 2Ki. 17:13, and many other passages in which Jehovah
speaks by the hand of his prophets.
1Ch. 6:31 (16).-“And these are they whom David set over the service
of song in the house of the Lord.” Lit., “over the hands of song,” .e.,
over the instruments of song, so as to minister music. So 2Ch. 29:27,
“the hands of the instruments (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).

Isa. 64:6 (5).-“And our iniquities.” Lit., “the hand of our iniquities”: {6.,
the power of our iniquities.

To this belongs Psa. 7:3 (4), “If there be any iniquity in my hands.”
Lit., in the hands of me: i.e., in me. A kind of Metonymy (q.v. [Note:
Which see.] ), or Synecdoche, by which a part of a person is put for
the whole.

In the New Testament we have the same use of the word χείρ
(cheir), Παπά.

Mar. 6:2.-“That even such mighty works are wrought by his hands.”
Lit., “by the hands of him”: i.e., by Him.

Luk. 1:71.-“From the hand of all that hate us”: i.e., not merely from our
enemies, but from the power of those enemies who hate us and cause
us to serve them.

So also Act. 5:12; Act. 7:25; Act. 7:35.

In Act. 15:23, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] omits “by the hands of them,” and
substitutes the word “letters” in italics. The R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] says, “They wrote thus by them” (Gal. 3:19 and Rev.
19:2).
6. Ъек (tavech) and ULLIO (kerev), midst
The phrase “in the midst” is used phonastically when it is not to be
taken literally as being equidistant from the extremes, or when it only
adds emphasis to the sense.

Gen. 45:6.-“These two years hath the famine been in the land.” Lit.,
“in the midst of the land”: .e., all over it. Here it is not translated at all.
Num. 14:13.-“Thou broughtest up this people in (or by) thy might from
among them.” Lit., “out of the midst of them”: out of Egypt. See also
Jos. 3:17. 2Ki. 4:13. Psa. 22:14 (15).-“My heart is like wax; it is
melted in the midst of my bowels”: i.e., within me. So Psa. 40:8; Psa.
40:10 (9, 11).

Psa. 22:22 (23).-“In the midst of the congregation will | praise thee”:
ie., in the assembly of the People; not of the “church,” which was
afterwards revealed to Paul in the New Testament Scriptures as the
“Mystery.”* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and
publisher.] But wherever God’s People are assembled, there is He “in
the midst of ({:6., with) them.”

Psa. 40:8; Psa. 40:10 (9, 11).-“In the midst of my heart”: i.e., in me.
Psa. 48:9 (10).-“In the midst of thy temple”: i.e., in thy temple.

Isa. 10:23.-“In the midst of all the land.”
Hab. 3:2.-“Revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of
the years make known’: i.e., within or during that time of Tribulation.
(See also under Anadiplosis).
Zec. 2:5; Zec. 2:10-11 (9, 14, 15).-“In the midst of thee”: i.e., in thee.
Mat. 13:49.-“And sever the wicked from among the just”: i.e., from. So
Act. 17:33. 2Co. 6:17.

For other illustrations see Mat. 13:25. Luk. 17:11. Heb. 2:12.
(Compare Psa. 22:22 (23), above).

7. MO (lev), MOO (levav), heart

The word “heart” is sometimes used pleonastically by Metonymy
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ) for the midst, when it does not mean literally
the precise middle point.
Exo. 15:8.-“In the heart of the sea.” So Psa. 46:2. Pro. 23:34; Pro.
30:19. Eze. 27:4.
Mat. 12:40.-“In the heart of the earth”: {6., in the earth.

8. Γ6μι (Davar), word.

is very frequently used in the same way.

Psa. 35:20.-“Deceitful matters.” Lit., “words of frauds”: i.e., frauds.
Psa. 65:3 (4).-“Iniquities prevail against me.” Here the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] puts
the literal meaning in the margin, “the words or matters of iniquity”:
i.e., my iniquitous matters. So with
Psa. 105:27.-“The words of his signs.”
Psa. 145:5.-“The words of thy wonders”: i.e., as rendered “thy
wondrous works.”
9. UCM (K?N, voice-

Gen. 3:8.-“They heard the voice of the Lord God walking, etc.”: i.e.,
the sound, or merely Jehovah Elohim.
Psa. 98:5.-“The voice of a psalm”: i.e., with a psalm.
Psa. 102:5 (6).-“The voice of my groaning”: i.e., my groaning.
Isa. 24:18.-“The noise (voice) of the fear. (See also under
Paronomasia).
Jer. 16:9.-“I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in
your days,

the voice of mirth, and

the voice of gladness,
the voice of the bridgeroom, and
the voice of the bride.”
This does not mean that there shall be any bridegrooms and
brides without voices, but that marriage itself shall cease.
Jer. 51:54.-“А sound of a cry.” Lit., the voice of a cry: {6., a great
clamour. So Zep. 1:10, etc.
10. YONH (yahmeem), days.
The word days joined with years, etc., is used pleonastically. See
Gen. 47:8, (9). Exo. 13:10. Jdg. 19:2 (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).
2Sa. 19:34 (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ). Psa. 90:10.
Gen. 29:14.-“And he abode with him the space of a month.” Marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] : “Heb., a month of days.” This, by the figure of
Hypallage (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), stands for the days of a month:
ie., a full month. So Num. 11:20-21.

11. engn (vayehee), and it came to pass.

Sometimes this word appears to be redundant; as well as the
Greek καὶ ἐγένετο (kai egeneto). That is to say, as the sense is
complete without it, it is added for the sake of emphasis.

See the preterite. Gen. 38:1; Gen. 38:7; Gen. 38:24; Gen. 38:28;
Gen. 39:10; Gen. 39:13; Gen. 39:15, etc. Mat. 7:28; Mat. 9:10; Mat.
11:1; Mat. 13:53; Mat. 19:1; Mat. 26:1. Mar. 1:9; Mar. 2:15. Luk. 1:24;
Luk. 1:41; Luk. 2:1; Luk. 2:6; Luk. 5:1.

So with the future; Deu. 18:19. Jos. 2:14. 1Ki. 18:24; 1Ki. 20:7. Isa.
7:23. Hos. 2:23. Joe. 3:15. Act. 2:6; Act. 3:23. Rom. 9:26.

2. Other Words
Deu. 33:19.-“Treasures hid in the sand.”

Here the figure is very freely rendered. Lit., it is “hidden-things
hidden of the sand”, i.e., the hidden things of the earth, in contrast with
the treasures of the sea.

Psa. 40:7.-“Then said |, Lo, | come: in the volume of the book it is
written of me” i.e., in the book, namely, Holy Scripture. (See under
Synecdoche). The second noun (in regimen) being as the genitive of
apposition. See Appendix Β.

Isa. 33:23.-“Тпеп is the prey of a great spoil divided. Heb., TT
ΠΙΜΜ (ad shalal), a prey of a spoil: i.e., a great spoil.

Dan. 12:2.-“And some to shame and everlasting contempt.”

Rom. 1:23.-“Unto an image made like.” Lit., “unto a likeness of an
image.”

By this figure the meaning is enhanced, so that it is as though it
said, “They changed the glory of the incorruptible God actually into an
image of corruptible man!
2Co. 5:1.-“The earthly house of this tabernacle,” emphasizing this
mortal body as being so different from the heavenly body.

Eph. 4:23.-“And be renewed in the spirit of your mind”: i.e., that your
whole new nature or inner man being a new creation, Divine in its
origin and impeccable in its character now causes the whole course of
life to flow in a different direction.

1Th. 2:13.-“When ye received the word of God, which ye heard of
us.” Lit., the word of hearing. λόγος ἁκοῆς (logos akoees). ἁκοῆ
(akoee) which means hearing, is often used by the figure of Metonymy
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ), for what is heard. See Joh. 12:38. Rom.
10:16. “Who hath believed our hearing”: i.e., what they have heard;
our preaching or testimony.

So here, the figure cannot be rendered literally, but the whole
sense is enchanced by the fact that it was the word of God, which they
heard, and not only heard but received it into their hearts.

Compare Heb. 4:2; and see under Metonymy-

Rev. 16:19.-“The fierceness of His wrath.”

Here, the figure is seen and beautifully translated: not literally, but
according to the enhanced sense.

The Greek is θυμὸς ὀργιίς (thumos orgees), the anger of His
wrath, the two words being synonymous. Both refer to the working of
the passions of the mind, but ὀργή (orgee) is the heat of the fire, while
θυμός (thumos) is the bursting forth of the flame. ὀργή (orgee),
therefore, is the more lasting feeling of anger and wrath. θυμός
(thumos) is the more sudden manifestation of it, so that “fierceness of
His wrath Beautifully expresses the figure.

Il. Sentences
Another kind of Pleonasm is when the sense or whole sentence is
repeated in another form, and thus put in another way. This may be
done either affirmatively or negatively.
1. Affirmatively
When the same sense is repeated affirmatively, it is hardly to be
distinguished from Synonymia (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), which it much
resembles. See Psa. 29:1-2; Psa. 89:31-32. Isa. 52:13, etc.

Gen. 1:20.-“And fowl that may fly above the earth, in the open
firmament of heaven.”

Instead of saying simply in the air, it first says “above the earth,”
and then it is further emphasized by “the open firmament of heaven,”
in order to make the distinction between these and what had been
created to be in the waters, and on the earth.

Num. 19:2.-“This is the ordinance of the law which Jehovah hath
commanded”: i.e., the law or statute, but it is put thus to impress
upon the people the importance of the special truth connected with
“the red heifer.”

Deu. 32:6.-“Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not
made thee? and established thee?”

Joh. 1:22.-“Who art thou?... What sayest thou of thyself?”

Joh. 5:24.-“He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent
me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation
(judgment), but is passed from death unto life.”

Act. 13:45.-“But when the Jews saw the multitudes,
they were filled with envy,

and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
contradicting-

and blaspheming.”

Php. 1:23.-“Which is far better.”

Here, the return of Christ is declared to be πολλῶ (ρο(/2), much;
μᾶλλον (malion), more; κρεῖσσον (kreisson), better, than either living
or dying; out of (ἐκ) which two he was being pressed by that third
thing: viz., the great desire εἰς τὸ ἀναλῦσαι (eis to analusai) unto the
return (see under Antimeria, Epanalepsis, Resumptio, and Apostasis).

Αναλύω means to return from thence hither (not from hence
thither). See Luk. 12:36. Job. 2:1. Jdt. 13:1. 1Es. 3:3. Wisd. 2:1; 5:12.
Ecc. 3:15. Macc. 8:25; 9:1: 12:7; 15:28. Josephus Aut. 6:41.

There is no other way of being “with Christ,” as the Thessalonian
saints are told 1Th. 4:17, οὕτως (hout?s), thus in this matter, shall we
ever be with the Lord: {6., by being “caught up to meet the Lord in the
air’: the sleeping saints not preceding those who are alive, and the
living ones not preceding those who have fallen asleep (verse 15), but
both sleeping and living saints raised and changed, together (ἅμα
hama) caught away.

See under Epanalepsis (pp. 206, 207), where it is shown that for
him to abide in the flesh is better for them-better than dying-but not
better than the coming of Christ.
2. Negatively
Here the sense is first put positively and then negatively, or vice versa.
This of course greatly emphasizes the original statement, and calls
very special attention to it.
Gen. 40:23.-“Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat
him.”

Here the simple statement that the chief butler did not remember
Joseph, would have expressed the fact simply and clearly; but in order
to emphasize and forcibly mark it, it is repeated negatively:-“but forgat
him,” as though to remind us that he acted after the manner of man. In
this character of man lies the justification of that definition of
“gratitude” which the world has given in condemnation of itself:-that it
is “a lively sense of favours to come”!

Gen. 42:2.-“That we may live and not die.” So Gen. 43:8, etc.

Exo. 9:19.-“Every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and
shall not be brought home.”

Exo. 12:20.-“Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations ye
shall eat unleavened bread.”
Deu. 28:13.-“And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail:
and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath.”
Deu. 32:6.-“O foolish people, and unwise.”
Deu. 33:6.- αἱ Reuben live and not die.”

Thus this figure simply but emphatically reverses the
pronouncement of Jacob in Gen. 49:3-4.
1Sa. 1:11.-“And remember me, and not forget thine handmaid.”
1Ki. 6:18.-The stones within the Temple-walls were overlaid with
cedar (verses 15, 16), and this cedar was further overlaid with gold
(verse 21). It is not, therefore, necessary to the description to add
verse 18: “There was no stone seen”: but it was necessary to
emphasize the fact, because of the important truth which these stones
were afterwards to be used to typify: viz., that the “living stones” (1Pe.
2:5), who are built up a spiritual house, are as completely covered with
the Divine and the glorious righteousness of Christ, in which they
appear in the presence of God, “perfect in Christ Jesus,” “complete in
Him.” Nothing whatever in or of themselves being seen.
2Ki. 20:1.-“Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live”:
ie., thou shalt surely die.
Isa. 3:9.-“They declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not.”
Isa. 31:3.-“Now the Egyptians are men, and not God (ΕΙ); and their
horses are flesh and not spirit.” The figure is thus used to show the
people how easily Jehovah could destroy them.
Isa. 38:1.-“Thou shalt die, and not live”: to emphasize the certainty of
his death.
Isa. 45:22.-“| am God, and there is none else.” This to show that
there is none that save like Him.

So Isa. 46:9; Isa. 44:8.
Jer. 20:14.-“Cursed be the day wherein | was born: let not the day
wherein my mother bare me be blessed.”
Eze. 18:13.-“He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he
shall surely die.” Here, the negative is put first, and then repeated in
the positive form.
Eze. 28:2.-“Thou art a man, and not God.”
Eze. 33:15.-“He shall surely live: he shall not die.* [Note: See also
under Asyndeton.]
Hos. 5:3.-“l know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me.”
Hos. 11:9.-Ί am God, and not man.”
Amo. 5:20.-“Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not
