to tell a strange tale, then to speak darkly or in riddles. Hence an
enigma is a dark or obscure saying, a puzzling statement or action. A
statement of which the meaning has to be searched for in order to be
discovered.

Enigma thus differs from Parable, in that the latter is generally
explained. When a Parable is without any explanation, it may be
called an Enigma, i.e., a dark or obscure saying.

See Psa. 78:2 quoted in Mat. 13:35. The “dark saying” of the Old
Testament is 2222 (cheedah); from 22? (chood), to tie in a knot, to
twist: a knotty or intricate saying.

It is rendered dark saying three times (Psa. 49:4 (5); 78:2. Pro.
1:6); dark sentence, once (Dan. 8:23); dark speech, once (Num. 12:8);
hard question, twice (1Ki. 10:1. 2Ch. 9:1); proverb, once (Hab. 2:6);
riddle, nine times (Jdg. 14:12-19. Eze. 17:2).

When the saying is very obscure indeed, it is called

HYPNIGMA, i.e., the same word, with the preposition ὑπό (hypo)
prefixed, meaning under, i.e., а saying deep as well as dark.

Also HYPNIXIS, from ὑπό (hypo), under, and αἰνισσομαι
(ainissomai), to speak darkly. Hence, a speaking beneath: i.e., having
another meaning beneath what is actually said.
When the Enigma is connected with the names of persons or
places, it is known by the name Polyonymia. (See the next Figure).
There are sayings dark and deep in the Scriptures beside those
that are actually so designated.
Gen. 49:10 is in the form of Enigma. “The sceptre shall not depart
from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come;
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” See under
Metonymy.
Jdg. 14:14.-Samson’s Enigma is well known.
“Out of the eater came forth meat,
And out of the strong came forth sweetness.”
The answer is given in verse 18, in the form of another question
(See Anteisagoge):
“What is sweeter than honey?
And what is stronger than a lion?”
This is a saying both “dark” and “deep”: for there is precious truth
hidden in that darkness and those depths, which neither the Philistines
nor the natural man can understand or receive.

The Living Word (Christ) is stronger than the strong man armed
(Mat. 12:29. Mar. 3:27. Luk. 12:21-22). For the Lion means in Hebrew
the strong one.

The Written Word (the Scriptures of truth) are sweeter than honey
(Psa. 119:103; Psa. 19:10 (11). Jer. 15:16).

All who know this blessed deliverance which the great Deliverer
brings, cry out in the words of Psa. 35:10, “Lord, who is like unto thee,
which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the
poor and needy from him that spoileth him?” (See Erotesis and
Prosopopeosia).

The Law was a strong Lion (Gal. 3:10): but the honey is found in
verse 13.
Sin is a strong Lion (Rom. 5:21): but the honey is found in Rom.
6:6; Rom. 7:18-25. And 1Co. 15:56-57.

The World is a strong Lion (Luk. 8:14. Gal. 5:21): but the honey is
found in Joh. 16:33.

Affliction is a strong Lion (Job. 5:6-7; Job. 14:1-2. Act. 14:22): but
the honey is found in Psa. 119:67; Psa. 119:71; Psa. 34:19 (20). Rom.
8:35-39. Heb. 12:11.

Death is a strong Lion (Rom. 5:12. Heb. 9:27): but the honey is
found in 2Ti. 1:10. Hos. 13:14, and 1Co. 15:54-55.

The answer to these Enigmas is found in Psa. 73:16-17, “When |
thought to know this it was too painful for me; Until | went into the
sanctuary of God. Then understood I.”

Isa. 11:1 is a dark saying, and has to be interpreted by what follows.
Isa. 21:11-12, is another dark saying.

Eze. 17:2-10 gives a prophecy concerning the King of Babylon’s
coming to Jerusalem, and leading it into captivity, under the Enigma of
two Eagles.

Dan. 5:25-28.-The handwriting on the wall is given in the form of an
Enigma, in which the immediate fall of Babylon was announced.
Three words were written, the first twice (by Epizeuxis, q.v. [Note:
Which зее.] ), for emphasis.
22? Mineh.NUMBERED.
Tkel.
WEIGHED.
Pres.
DIVIDED.

These three words are interpreted by Daniel in verses 26-28, and
the fulfilment of them follows in verses 30, 31. See under
Paronomasia.
