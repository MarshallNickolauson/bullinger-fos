Hence, called by the Latins, TRANSITIO, transition, and
INTERFACTIO, a doing or putting a thing in between, as in passing
from one thing to another.

The figure is used when the speaker or writer passes from one
thing to another by reminding his hearers or readers of what has been
said, and only hinting at what might be said, or remains to be said.

Sometimes, however, it is used of an abrupt transition.
1Co. 11:16-17.-In verse 16, Paul only hints at the contentions of
others; and then passes on, in verse 17 to the subject of the Lord’s
Supper.
1Co. 12:31.-Having hinted at the best spiritual gifts, Paul suddenly
makes the transition to one which is more excellent than all: viz.,
Divine love, which becomes the subject of chapter xiii.
1Co. 15:1-58 -The apostle hints at the subject matter of his former
preaching among the Corinthians; but, in verse 12, he passes on to
discuss the great subject of the resurrection of the dead.

Heb. 6:1-3.-In verse 1, the “first principles” are mentioned; and, these
having been briefly hinted at, the transition is at once made to the
subject in hand.
Epanorthosis; or, Correction
A Recalling of what has been said, in order to correct it as by an
Afterthought
Ep’-a-nor-thé-sis. Greek, ἐπανόρθωσις, from ἐπί (epi), upon, ava
(ana), up or again, and ὀρθοῦν (orthoun), to set straight (from ὀρθός
(orthos), straight).
Hence Epanorthosis means a setting upright again.
