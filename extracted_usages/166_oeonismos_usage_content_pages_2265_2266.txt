An Expression of Feeling by way of wishing or hoping for a thing
@’-6-nis’-mos. Greek, οἰωνισμός, a divining by the flight of birds,
divination. Then, because these diviners generally saw what they
wished to see, it came to mean a looking for, especially in the sense
of a foreboding.

The Latins named the figure OPTATIO, a hoping for, or wishing. By
this figure, what is said is changed from a plain statement to the
expressing of it as a hope, or an ardent desire, or lively anticipation,
often introduced by the words “O that,” etc. See Deu. 5:29 (26). Num.
14:2.

See Deu. 32:29 : “O that they were wise, that they understood this,
that they would consider their latter end!”

Psa. 55:6. (7).-“Oh! that | had wings like a dove!”

Psa. 81:13 (14).-“Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and
Israel had walked in my ways!” etc.

Isa. 48:18.-“O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then
had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
the sea.”

Isa. 64:1 (63:19).-“Oh that thou would rend the heavens, that thou
wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy
presence.” See also under Euche.

There are many examples, which the Bible student will call to mind
or search out for himself.
Gal. 5:12.-“I would that they were even cut off which trouble you.”

Thaumasmos; or, Wondering
An Expression of Feeling by way of Wonder

Thau-mas‘-mos. Greek, θαυμασμός, а marvelling. The figure is used
when, instead of describing or stating a thing as a matter of fact, it is
expressed in the form of marvelling at it, either directly or by
implication.

When the wonder is expressed as an exclamation, it combines
with it the character of Ecphonesis (see below).
Num. 24:5.-“How goodly thy tents, О Jacob.”
