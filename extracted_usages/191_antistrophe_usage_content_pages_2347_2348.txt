The figure is so called because the words of a speaker are turned
against himself in Retort.

When the retort is violent, it is called BION (Bi-ae-on), Greek,
Βίαιον, forcible, violent, compulsory.

Hence the Latin, VIOLENTUM, violent, and INVERSIO, inversion,
a turning against.
Mat. 15:26-27.-The woman of Canaan used this figure in her reply to
Christ. He had said “It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to
cast it to dogs.” And she said, “Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the
crumbs which fall from their master’s table,” and thus turned His words
against Himself.
2Co. 11:22.-“Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I.
Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.” See also under Epiphoza.

When the words thus turned against the speaker are an
accusation, then the figure is called
Anticategoria; or, Tu Quoque
The use of a Counter-Charge, or Recrimination
An‘-ti-cat’-ee-gor’-i-a. Greek, ἀντικατηγορία, a counter-charge: from
ἀντί (anti), against, and κατηγορέω, to speak against: hence, to
recriminate, to accuse in turn.

The figure is used when we retort upon another the very
insinuation or accusation which he has made against us. It differs from
Antistrophe (see above); in that it has to do, not with any general kind
of words, but with a particular accusation.

It is what the Latins called a TU QUOQUE; or, ACCUSATIO
ADVERSA, an opposite accusation, or an accusation turned against
another; or, TRANSLATIO IN ADVERSARIUM, a transferring against
an adversary.

Eze. 18:25.-“Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, О
house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?” So
verse 29, and 33:17.

This would be Anteisagoge, were it a simple question instead of an

accusation.
