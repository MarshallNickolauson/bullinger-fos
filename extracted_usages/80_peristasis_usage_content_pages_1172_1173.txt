Peristasis; or, Description of Circumstances
Per-is’-ta-sis’, from the Greek περιστασις, anything that is round
about, circumstances; and this from περι (peri), around, and στάσις
(stasis), a standing, setting, or placing:

Peristasis is the name of the figure which describes the
circumstances; and hence, it was called by the Latins,
CIRCUMSTANTI.DESCRIPTIO.

See Joh. 4:6; Joh. 18:18, etc.

When this figure is used for the purpose of moving the passions by
a graphic description of circumstances, it is called

DIASKEUE.

Di-as-keu’-ee’ (διασκευή), from διασκευάζεσθαι (diaskeuazesthai),
to arm, equip, or prepare oneself. the argument being made out of the
particular circumstances of a case.

When the description is confined to the order of certain persons,
things, events, or circumstances, it is called
Protimesis; or, Description of Order
Pro’-ti-mee’-sis (προήµησις), a putting of one thing before another:
from ττρό (pro), before, and τιµή (timee), honour. Hence, the figure is
employed when things are enumerated according to their places of
honour or importance, using the particles “first,” “again,” “then,” or
“firstly,” “secondly,” “thirdly,” etc.

This figure; therefore, increases the emphasis of a particular
statement by setting forth the order in which the things treated of
stand, or take place.
1Co. 15:5-8.-Speaking of the resurrection of Christ, it is written: “He
was seen of Cephas; then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of
above five hundred brethren at once: ... after that, he was seen of
James; then of all the apostles: and, last of all he was seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time.”

In like manner we have the same words employed of the
resurrection of “those who are Christ's”:
