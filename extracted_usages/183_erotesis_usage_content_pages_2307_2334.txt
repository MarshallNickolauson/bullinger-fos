19. Double questions.
1. т Positive Affirmation
Where the answer must be in the affirmative.

“Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling?” (Psa. 56:13 (14)). [Yes,
thou wilt]. Here the present comes in between the past (“thou hast
delivered my soul from death”) and the future (“that | may walk before
God in the light of the living.”

“These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
thee? [Every one]. Desolation and destruction, and the famine, and
the sword: by whom shall | comfort thee?” (Isa. 51:19): ie., by every
one.

“Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will
not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?” (Luk. 14:5). [No
one].

2. In Negative Affirmation
Where the question is put in the negative form, and the answer must
be in the affirmative, and very emphatically so; the truth being thus
much more forcibly brought out by the question than by a mere cold
and formal statement of the fact.
“Is not the whole land before thee?” (Gen. 13:9): i.e., yes, it is.
“Do not thy brethren feed in Shechem?” (Gen. 37:13). [Yes, they
do.] Here, in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,
the words “the flock” are inserted (in the latter not in italics). This is
because of the words “their father’s flock,” which occur in the previous
verse. But this is one of the fifteen dotted words in the Hebrew Text,
which means that they had got into the Text at a very early date; and
the scribes, not liking actually to remove them from the Text, put a row
of small dots along the top to show that the word or words ought not to
be in the Text, though they had not been taken out. As the words “the
flock” are dotted in the Hebrew, verse 12, means that they had gone to
feed themselves in Shechem! (Compare Eze. 34:2; Eze. 34:8; Eze.
34:10, and Isa. 56:11-12).

“Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother, whom | know to be eloquent?”
(Exo. 4:14): ie., | know that he is so.

“Are they not on the other side Jordan?” etc. (Deu. 11:30).

“Shall | not seek rest for thee?” etc. (Rth. 3:1).

“Is it not | that commanded the people to be numbered?” (1Ch.
21:17; compare 2Sa. 24:17).
“Is there not a warfare to man upon the earth?” (Job. 7:1, R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ); marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , a
time of service. (See the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin).

“Do not all go to one place?” (i.e., to Sheol, or the grave) (Ecc.
6:6). The answer is: Yes, they do!

“Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have | no
power to deliver?” (Isa. 50:2). Here, we have a combined affirmative
and negative:-No; my hand is not shortened. | can redeem; and, |
have power to deliver. Compare 59:1.

“Do not | fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:24). Yes.
The previous question is positive.

“Is not the meat cut off before our eyes?” (Joe. 1:16).

“Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the Lord” (Amo.
2:11).

“Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light?” (Amo.
5:20). See under Metonymy and Pleonasm.

“Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name
have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?”
(Mat. 7:22). See under Epizeuxis.

“Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures,
neither the power of God?” (Mar. 12:24). Here, the “not” is µή (mee)
which denies subjectively, and implies not merely negative ignorance,
but positive unwillingness to know the Scriptures. See Mat. 22:29.

“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of Christ?” (1Co. 10:16). Yes, it is the fellowship of the
members of the one Body in partaking of all the merits of Christ’s
blood. “The bread which we break, is it not the communion (or
fellowship) of the Body of Christ?”

The next verse makes it perfectly clear that the Body here
mentioned is Christ Mystical, because the Holy Spirit goes on to give
the reason-“For we being many are one bread, and, one Body.” See
1Co. 12:12.

“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salvation?” (Heb. 1:14).

So Oba. 1:5; Oba. 1:8. Jon. 4:11. Joh. 4:35; Joh. 6:70; Joh. 11:9.
Sometimes the negative is omitted by Ellipsis (q.v. [Note: Which зее.]
).
2Sa. 15:27 -“The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou а
seer?”
Here the negative is supplied in italics. But not in
Eze. 8:6.-“Son of man, seest thou what they do?”: i.e., seest thou not?
So 1Sa. 2:27, and especially Jer. 31:20, where it should be “/s not
Ephraim my dear son? /s he not a pleasant child?” as is clear from
what follows.

3. In Affirmative Negation
This is a very important division, because some of the weightiest
truths are conveyed by this form of question: i.e., where the question
is put in the affirmative, and the answer to be supplied by the mind is a
very emphatic negative.

“Is anything too hard for the Lord?” (Gen. 18:14). No! there is
nothing too hard for Him, for compare Jer. 32:17. Zec. 8:6. Mat. 3:9;
Mat. 19:26. Luk. 1:37.

“Shall | hide from Abraham that thing which | do?” (Gen. 18:17).

“How can | dispossess them?” (Deu. 7:17): i.e., | cannot do it.

“Who is like unto thee?” is the cry of all the “poor and needy” ones
whom Jehovah has delivered. (Psa. 35:10). See Exo. 15:11. Deu.
33:26-27. 1Sa. 2:2. Psa. 71:19; Psa. 73:25; Psa. 89:6 (7); 113:5.

“Shall they escape by iniquity?” (Psa. 56:7 (8)). No, they shall not.
“Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up
for me against the workers of iniquity?” (Psa. 94:16): i.e., there is no
one to do this but God; as verse 17 clearly shows.

“Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all
his praise?” (Psa. 106:2). The answer is that no one can.

Psa. 9:14 (15) does not conflict with this: for there it is a prayer for
Jehovah's mercy, so that he “may show forth” all His praise. Compare
Psa. 40:5 (6); 139:17, 18.

Ecc. 3:21.-Here, we must take the question “who know ...
whether,” etc., as requiring a negative answer. See under Appendix E.

“Can any hide himself in secret places that | shall not see him?
saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:24). No, none can so hide. The following
question is negative.

“How shall then his kingdom stand?” (Mat. 12:26): ie., it is
impossible.

“Which of you convicteth me of sin?” (Joh. 8:46). ἐλέγχω
(elengcho) does not mean to convince, but to convict by bringing in
guilty, lay bare, expose. No one could ever bring Christ in guilty of sin.
This explains Joh. 16:8. See Prosapodosis.

“What if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith
of God without effect?” (Rom. 3:3). See under Tapeinosis.

“If God be for us, who can be against us?”

“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?”

“Who is he that condemneth?”

“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” (Rom. 8:31-35).
See under Epistrophe, Anaphora, Ellipsis, which are all employed in
these verses.

“Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
counsellor? Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be
recompensed unto him again?” (Rom. 11:34-35).

“Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?” etc. (1Co.
9:7).

“Unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son?”
(Heb. 1:5): /е., to none of them, but to the Son only. These words,
“Thou art my Son,” appear to be the Divine formula for the anointing of
Christ: Mat. 3:17, for His office of prophet; Mat. 17:5, for His office of
priest, * [Note: See Christ’s Prophetic Teaching, by the same author
and publisher.] and Psa. 2:7 (cf. Heb. 1:5), for His office of king.

“To which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand,
until | make thine enemies thy footstool?” (Heb. 1:13), ie., He never
said this to any created angelic being.

See, for other instances, Gen. 50:19. 1Sa. 2:25. Job. 40:2, etc.
Isa. 40:13-14. Joe. 1:2, etc., and many other places.

Sometimes the negative in the answer is not absolute, but only

relative.

“Who knoweth the power of thine anger?” (Psa. 90:11). Not every
one. See verses 13 and 16.

See also under Metonymy.
“Who can find a virtuous woman?” (Pro. 31:10): /е., not that there
are absolutely none, but that they are relatively few. See the structure
under Acrostichion.

“Who hath believed our report?” (Isa. 53:1). Not, no one, but those
to whom it is given-the Remnant. See under Hypotyposis and
Metonymy.

“Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and
he shall know them?” (Hos. 14:9 (10)): .e., not that no one is wise, but
that such are relatively few.

4. In Demonstration
Sometimes a question is used to make an affirmation as to a certain
subject, demonstrating a fact or proving a truth.

“What man is he that feareth the Lord?” (Psa. 25:12). This is to call
attention to the demonstration in the next verse.

“Son of man, seest thou [ποῇ what they do?” (Eze. 8:6). We have
already had this trader a negative affirmation, but its object was to say,
Behold, thou art a witness of their abominable idolatry.
“What went ye out into the wilderness to see?” This question is
three times repeated: to demonstrate to the People the greatness of
John the Baptist (Mat. 11:7-9).

So Psa. 34:12-13 (13, 14). Jer. 9:12 (11). Hos. 14:9 (10) might also
be put under this head. Pro. 22:29; Pro. 29:20.

5. In Wonder and Admirationg
“Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? And shall
Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?” (Gen. 17:17), in wonder at the
Divine power. See Rom. 4:17-21. Abraham laughed for joy, for he fell
upon his face in reverence (Joh. 8:56. Gen. 21:8). Sarah laughed from
incredulity (18:12). Contrast Martha and Mary in Joh. 11:21 and Joh.
11:32. Mary “fell down at his feet.”

“How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?” (Gen. 27:20).

“What is this that God hath done unto us?” (Gen. 42:28).

“How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
unity!” (Psa. 133:1). See under Asterismos.

“Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah?” (Isa. 43:1-2). See under Prosopopeoeia.

This refers not to Christ’s work of redemption for His People, but to
the day of His vengeance and judgment on His enemies; as the
context clearly shows.

“How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah)?”
(Eze. 16:30).

“How soon is the fig-tree withered away?” (Mat. 21:20). Or better-
How can the fig-tree have withered by this time?

So also Mar. 6:37.

See also 1Sa. 9:21. Hab. 3:8.

6. In Rapture or Exultation
“Oh how great is thy goodness!” (Psa. 31:19 (20)).

“How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, О God (El)! How
great is the sum of them!” (Psa. 139:17). See Anthropopatheia.

“What is man, that thou art mindful of him?” (Psa. 8:4 (5); 144:3.
Job. 7:17. Heb. 2:6), to magnify the grace of God in lifting up such an
one from the dunghill to make him inherit the throne of glory (1Sa.
2:8). See Psa. 113:7-8.

“Who am I, O Lord God (Adoani Jehovah)?” (2Sa. 7:18).

It was the revelation of the greatness of God’s grace that enabled
David thus to take the place of a true worshipper. In verse 1, David
“sat in his house,” and before himself; then his thought was to build a
house for God; but, when he learnt that God was going to build him a
house, then he went in, and “sat before the Lord.”
“Is this the manner of man, O Lord God (Adonai Jehovah)?” (2Sa.
7:19). The margin of the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
reads “Is this the law of man, О Lord God,” and the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin
says, “Heb. /aw.” But idiomatically it means, “Is this the law for
humanity?”: i.e., the promise to David embraced blessing for the
whole of humanity, and David by faith saw it, and exulted in it.

7. In Wishes
“Who will give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is
by the gate?” (2Sa. 23:15, Heb.). See under Conismos.

“Whom shall | send, and who will go for us?” (Isa. 6:8).

“Who shall deliver me from this body of death?” (Rom. 7:24 (marg.
{Note: arg. Margin.] )). See under Ecphonesis, Metonymy, Hypallage,
and Ellipsis. By these figures is this height of Christian experience
emphasised: i.e., the knowledge of the fact as to what God had done
with “sins” (Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom. 4:1-25;
Rom. 5:1-11), and also as to what He had done with “sin” (5:12-8:39);
so that, although the fruits of the old tree are still seen and mourned
over, there is the blessed knowledge that God reckons it as dead-as
having died with Christ, and that we are to reckon the same.

8. In Refusals and Denials
“How shall | curse, whom God (EL) hath not cursed? or how shall |
defy, whom the Lord (Jehovah) hath not defied?” (Num. 23:8): i.e., |
neither can nor dare do so.

“What have | to do with thee?” (Joh. 2:4). See under Idiom. Also
Jdg. 11:12. 2Sa. 16:10. 1Ki. 17:18. 2Ki. 3:13. Mat. 8:29. Mar. 5:7. Luk.
8:28.

9. In Doubts
“Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After | am waxen old
shall | have pleasure?” (Gen. 18:12). See above.

“O Ephraim, what shall | do unto thee? O Judah, what shall | do
unto thee?” (Hos. 6:4). See under Aporia. So Hos. 11:8.

“Wherewith shall | come before the Lord, and bow myself before
the high God?” (Mic. 7:6).
“But the righteousness which is of faith, speaketh on this wise, Say
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?” (Rom. 10:6-7). See
under Epitrechon. These doubts, raised by self-righteousness, are
seen to be removed only by the imputation of a Divine righteousness.

10. In Admonition
“Hearest thou not, my daughter?” (Rth. 2:8): ie., diligently hearken.
“Go not to glean in another field.”

“Who hath warned you (with the emphasis on the “you”) to flee

from the wrath to come?” (Mat. 3:7).

11. In Expostulation
“Where art thou?” (Gen. 3:9). To show Adam where he really was, and
the condition into which he had fallen, having lost fellowship and
communion with God.

“What is this that thou hast done unto me?” etc. (Gen. 12:18-19).

“What is that betwixt me and thee?” (Gen. 23:15).
“Who am | that | should go into Pharaoh?” (Exo. 3:11).

“What could have been done more to my vineyard, that | have not
done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
brought it forth wild grapes?” (Isa. 5:4).

“Wherefore, have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?”
(Isa. 58:3).

So Gen. 31:26-27; Gen. 44:4; Gen. 44:15. Psa. 11:1; Psa. 50:16
(see Apodioxis). Eze. 12:22; Eze. 18:1 (2). Dan. 3:14; and many
examples in the prophecy of Malachi.

12. In Prohibitions
“Why should | be deprived also of you both in one day?” (Gen. 27:45).

“Why should | kill thee?” (1Sa. 19:17): i.e., let me not have to kill
thee.

“Wherefore should the heathen say,” etc.? (Psa. 79:10): i.e., let not
the heathen say.
“Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the
work of thine hands?” (Ecc. 5:6).

“Why shouldest thou die before thy time?” (Ecc. 7:17).

“Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword?” (Jer. 27:13).
So verse 17, “Wherefore should this city be laid waste?” i.e., Do not
die. Do not let this city be laid waste.

“Why will ye die, О house of Israel?” (Eze. 33:11): /е., Turn from
your ways, so that ye die not. See under Epizeuxis and Obtestatio.

So 2Sa. 2:22. 2Ch. 25:16. Dan. 1:10, etc.

13. In Pity and Commiseration

“How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people?” (Lam. 1:1; see
2:1, etc.). See under Antithesis and Ellipsis.

“How often would | have gathered thy children, etc.?” (Mat. 23:37).

There are many examples in the Book of Lamentations.
14. In Disparagements
“Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he
to be accounted of?” (Isa. 2:22).
“What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?”
(Ki. 9:13).
15. In Reproaches
“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying,
What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto them, What
burden? | will even forsake you, saith the Lord” (Jer. 23:33. So Jer.
23:35-36).
“What is truth?” (Joh. 18:38). See /rony.
16. In Lamentation
“Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!” (Psa. 3:1 (2)): i.e., how
come mine enemies to be so many?
“Why hast thou forsaken me?” (Psa. 22:1 (2)).
“Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his
tender mercies?” (Psa. 77:7-9 (8-10)). These lamentations arise from
self-occupation (see verses 1-6). It is our natural “infirmity” (verse 10),
that leads us into it. The only remedy is to cease from self-occupation,
and look away from ourselves to God (verses 10-20): then happiness
and praise take the place of lamentation.

Compare Psa. 73:1-28; where the same experience is gone
through, only then the trouble arises from looking around instead of
looking within. But the remedy for this “foolishness” (verse 22) is the
same as for the “infirmity”: viz., looking up (verses 17 and 23-28).

The lesson from questions in these two Psalms (Ixxvii. and Ixxiii.)
is this. If we want to be miserable, all we have to do is to look within. If
we want to be distracted, all we have to do is to look around. But if we
would be happy, we must look up, away from ourselves and others, to
God.* [Note: See Things to Come for Oct., 1899.]

“How is the faithful city become an harlot!” (Isa. 1:21). Or, “How is
it that the loyal city has turned harlot?” See under Synecdoche and
Antithesis.
“Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? Shall
the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?”
(Lam. 2:20).

17. In Indignation
“Why do the heathen rage? and [why do] the people imagine a vain
thing?” (Psa. 2:1).

“How long shall | be with you? How long shall | suffer you?” (Mat.
17:17). See Ecphonesis.

18. In Absurdities and Impossibilities
“Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?” (Job. 14:4).

“Shall mortal man be more just than God? or shall a man be more
pure than His Maker?” (Job. 4:17).

“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then
may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil” (Jer. 13:23). See
Paroemia.
“How can a man be born when he is old?” etc. (Joh. 3:4).
“How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” (Joh. 6:52). It was “a
hard saying” (verse 60), and hence they thought it absurd.
“Have any of the elders or of the Pharisees believed on him?”
(Joh. 7:48). This question forms, from that day to this, the excuse for
not acknowledging the claims of God or His Truth, unless the great
and the influential of the Church receive them. It is the putting of man
before God, instead of studying to show ourselves approved only to
God.

“Who is this Son of man?” (Joh. 12:34). This was the expression of
the absurdity on the part of Christ's enemies.

19. Double Questions
Sometimes double questions are employed, repeating the same
question in different words so as to express the fact more
emphatically.

See Job. 4:17; Job. 6:5, etc.; 8:3; 10:4, etc.; 11:2, 7; 22:3. Isa.
10:15. Jer. 5:9; Jer. 5:29.
Dialogismos; or, Dialogue
Dj-al-o-gis-mos. Greek, διαλογισµός, conversation, arguing, from
διαλογίζεσθαι (dialogizesthai), to converse, argue.

This figure is used when we represent one or more persons as
speaking about a thing, instead of saying it ourselves: Dialogue.

The persons speak in a manner suitable to their character or
condition.

When there are not two persons represented, but the objecting
and answering is done by the one speaker, the figure is called
LOGISMUS, and what is stated is said to be in dialogismo, or in
logismo.

Sometimes the speaker brings forward another as speaking, and
uses his words, adapting them to the object in view.

The Latins called this figure SERMOCINATIO, which means the
same thing.

Isa. 14:16-19.-“They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and
consider thee, saying,
