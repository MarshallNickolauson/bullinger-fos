Pros?-?-po-graph?-i-a, from πρόσωπιον (pros?-?-pon), a face, one’s
look, or countenance, and later, a person; and γράφειν (graphein), to
write, or describe. Hence Prosopographia is a vivid description of a
person by delineating the general mien, dress manners, etc.

Called by the Latins PERSON.DESCRIPTIO, description of a
person

See Mat. 3:4, where John’s appearance, etc., is described.

See also the graphic description of the Lord, after the execution of
His judgments in the day of His vengeance (isa. 63:1-6). (Compare,
for the interpretation of the passage, Isa. 34:8; Isa. 61:2).

Also the description of Jerusalem compared with a person when
she was caused “to know her abominations” (Eze. 16:4-26).

When the description is confined to the personal appearance, or
features, it is called

Effictio; or, Word-Portrait

Ef-fic’-ti-o, from Latin, effingo, to form, fashion artistically, to portray.
