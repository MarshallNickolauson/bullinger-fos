throwing of a javelin, from jaculum, a javelin (from jacere, to throw).
This name is confined to a parenthesis which consists of a short
prayer, such as “God forbid,” “God be praised,” “Thank God.”
Hos. 9:14.-Here, the prayer is in the form of a question:-“Give them, О
Lord: what wilt thou give? give them,” etc. See under Aposiopesis-
Hypotimesis; or, Under-Estimating
Parenthetic Addition by way of Apology or Excuse
Hy-po-ti-mee’-sis (ὑποτίμησις), from ὑπτό (hypo), under, and ήµησις
(timeesis), a valuing, or estimating, from τιμάω (tima?), to deem, or
hold worthy. Hence, an under-estimating, under-valuing.
A parenthetical remark is so called when it is apologetic, in order
to excuse some bold or extravagant use of language, such as “If | may
so say,” or “So to speak,” or, “As it were.”
