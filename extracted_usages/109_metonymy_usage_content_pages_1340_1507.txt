|. Metonymy of the Cause

This is when the cause is put for the effect; and it is of four kinds: (i.)
The person for the action; (Π.) The instrument for the effect; (Ш.) The
thing or the action for its product; and (iv.) The material cause for the
matter made. We will consider these in their order: and the examples
themselves will explain the meaning and use of the figure.
i. The person acting for the thing done
1. The Spirit for the gifts and operations of the Spirit
Joh. 3:34.-“Рог God giveth not the Spirit by measure to Him”: i.e., the
gifts and operations produced by the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a
person, and cannot, therefore, be measured out or given by measure.
The “measure” must consequently mean the measure of His power or
gifts bestowed.

Joh. 6:63.-“The words that | speak unto you, they, are spirit ({6., the
gift and operation of the Spirit of God), and they are life (i.e., they give
and produce divine, spiritual and eternal life).”

Act. 19:2.-“Did ye on believing receive the Holy Ghost?” Here, this
must mean the wondrous gifts of the Spirit, because they had already
received Him, or they could not have believed at all. Verse 6 also
shows that this must be so, for the very gifts and powers are named
and exercised.

1Co. 14:12.-“Forasmuch as ye also are zealous of spirits”: ie., of
spiritual powers and gifts and revelations. Here, the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has
actually so rendered the figure, and put the literal Greek in the margin!
So verses 26 and 32.

1Со. 14:32.-“The spirits (i.e., the spiritual gifts) of prophets are subject
to prophets”: i.e., they are able to use them to edification according to
the instructions given in Scripture.
Gal. 3:2.-“Received ye the Spirit ({6., the gifts of the Spirit) by the
works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?”

Verse 5: “He, therefore, that ministereth to you the Spirit ({6., the
gifts of the Spirit) and worketh miracles among you,” etc.

Eph. 5:18.-“Be filled with the Spirit’: {6., not with the Person of the
Holy Spirit surely! but with His operations: i.e., with the gifts which
come through the ministry of the Word; as is clear from Col. 3:16,
where this effect is produced by the same cause: viz., occupation of
the heart with God-the Word of Christ dwelling richly within us.

1Th. 5:19.-“Quench not the Spirit”: i.e., do not hinder in yourself or in
others the use of spiritual gifts.

The verb to quench is oBévvuul (sbennumi), to put out, and always
of extinguishing a light or fire; hence, to extinguish.* [Note: See its
occurrences: Mat. 22:20. Mar. 9:44; Mar. 9:46; Mar. 9:48. Eph. 6:16.
Heb. 11:34, where it is rendered “quench”; and Mat. 25:8, where it is
“gone out, or going out” (marg.).] It is impossible for mortal man to
extinguish the Holy Spirit of God: so that there must be a figure here.
That figure lies not in the word “quench,” but in the word “spirit,” which
is put for the gifts of the Spirit. These are quenched, when any,
assuming and usurping authority, forbid the use of them by a brother,
or hinder him in the exercise of them.
This is clearly the subject of the exhortation; for the very next
sentence goes on to speak of the manner in which it is to be obeyed:
“Despise not prophesyings”: do not treat them with contempt or scorn;
do not neglect or disregard them. This is the meaning of ἐξουθενέω
(exoutheneq) (see Luk. 23:11. Act. 4:11. Rom. 14:10, where it is
rendered set at nought; and Luk. 18:9. Rom. 14:3. 1Co. 1:28; 1Co.
16:11. Gal. 4:14, where it is rendered despise: and 1Co. 6:4, to be
least esteemed; and 2Co. 10:10, contemptible).

2. The Spirit is put also for His quickening, regenerating and
sanctifying work in man, in creating the new nature with its
spiritual desires and powers
Psa. 51:10 (12).-“Renew a right spirit within me”: i.e., the Divine
workings of the Spirit by which alone true obedience is rendered to

God. See Eze. 11:19. Eph. 4:23. Rom. 12:2.
Joh. 3:6.-“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
Here, the second time the word “spirit” is used, it is in a different
sense, by the figure of Antanaclasis (q.v. [Note: Which see.] , page
286); and by Metonymy it is put for the effect of the Spirit's operation:
ie., the New man, the New nature, in all its manifestations. This New
nature is constantly spoken of as “spirit” (see Rom. 8:1-15), just as the
Old nature is spoken of as “flesh.”

For examples of the word “spirit” being put for the work of the Holy
Spirit within man, see Psa. 51:17 (19). Isa. 26:9. Eze. 18:31. Mat. 5:3;
Mat. 26:41. Act. 17:16; Act. 19:21; Act. 20:22. Rom. 1:9. 1Co. 5:3-5;
1Co. 6:20. 1Pe. 3:4, etc.

Rom. 8:2.-“For the law of the spirit of life (/.e., not the Holy Spirit, but
His life-giving work in the New nature created within us) hath made
me free from the law of sin and death.”

The Law brought the knowledge of sin; and its wages-death. But
the work of the Holy Spirit has freed me from that Law, and has given
me a new nature, by which | serve and obey Him from a totally
different motive.

3. The Spirit is put for special and extraordinary operations of the

Spirit acting externally in various ways, publicly or privately
Num. 11:17.-“I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it
upon them”: {6., not the Person of the Holy Spirit, but His operations,
enabling Moses, and afterwards the seventy elders, to rule the
People.

The history goes on to tell how Joshua would have had two of
them forbidden! True specimen of official religion to-day, and through
all time; ever ready to forbid the use of spiritual powers and gifts that
come out of the ordinary course!

Eldad and Medad are types of what has been true from that time
till the present day.
2Ki. 2:9.-“Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me”: i.e., of thy
miraculous gifts, spiritual powers. It was so: and it was so shown; for
while Elijah’s miracles were eight in number, Elisha’s were sixteen.*
[Note: See Number in Scripture, by the same author and publisher,
page 202.]

Dan. 5:12; Dan. 6:3.-“Because an excellent spirit ... was in him”: i.e.,
the wonderful and extraordinary operations of the Spirit were manifest
in him.

Joh. 7:39.-“This spake he of the Spirit”: i.e., this outflow of spiritual
power mentioned in verse 38. A person could not flow out from
another person.

Luk. 1:17.-“And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of
Elijah”: i.e., the same wonderful spiritual power should be in John as
was in Elijah. See under Hendiadys.

Luk. 1:80.-“And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit”: i.e., in the
special and peculiar manifestations of the Spirit. So Luk. 2:40.

Act. 1:5.-“Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost”: i.e., ye shall be
immersed in spiritual “power” (see verse 8), which shall cover you as
well as fill you and flow out from you.

Act. 7:51.-“Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost”: i.e., the testimony of
the Holy Spirit as given by the prophets. Their fathers resisted the
prophets, and would not hear the Spirit's voice in them and now they,
like their fathers, were resisting the same testimony as given at
Pentecost, and since then culminating in Stephen.
The Holy Ghost in His testimony is always resisted by the natural
man: /е., opposed by him. He cannot, of course, be resisted in the
sense of being successfully repelled. The Greek word here is
avtittittTw (antipiptd), to fall against, oppose. It occurs only here, but
the context clearly shows the nature and character of the opposition,
the reference to the “ears” indicating that they refused to listen to His
testimony. The natural ear is always closed against the Divine
testimony, until it is “opened” by One who is stronger than the strong
man armed.
2Co. 3:6.-“Who hath made us competent ministers also of the New
Covenant: not of letter (/.e., the Divine Law of the Old Covenant), but
of spirit (1.6., the ministration of the Spirit, verse 8: the New Covenant
as contained in the Gospel).”

4. The Spirit is put also for special revelations and visions

communicated by Him
Eze. 37:1.-“The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in
the Spirit of the Lord”: i.e, in a vision.
2 Theas. 2:2.-“That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
neither by spirit ({.6., by a revelation professed to have been received
by the Spirit), nor by word (professed to be spoken by us), nor by
letter as from us (said to be written by us), as that the Day of the Lord
has set in.” For the meaning of this last statement, see the next verse
under Ellipsis, pages 52 and 53.

1Jn. 4:1-3.-“Beloved, believe not every spirit (i.e., every doctrine that
is put forth as the teaching of the Spirit), but try the spirits ({:6., their
teaching and doctrines, Act. 17:11), whether they are of God (or of
demons and evil spirits): because many false prophets are gone out
into the world. Hereby know ye the spirit (or doctrine and teaching) of
God. Every spirit ({6., doctrine) which confesseth (or teacheth) that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit (or
doctrine) that confesseth not (i.e., that does not teach) that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit (ie.,
teaching) of Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come; and
even now is it in the world.”

As Antichrist himself has not yet come, it must mean his teaching
which is already here. The confusion of the small and capital letters (5
and S) in this passage shows that the translators did not perceive the
Metonymy here used.

Rev. 1:10.- was in spirit.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] uses a capital S,
and not a small one as in chap. 4:2; 17:3, and Eze. 37:1, etc., but, the
meaning is the same. “I became in a spiritual vision or ecstasy; or, |
received a spiritual revelation;” which was afterwards written down.
See also Act. 10:10; Act. 22:17, and 2Co. 12:2, where similar visions
and revelations are called a “trance.” There is great divergence of the
use of small and capital letters in all different versions.

5. Parents and Ancestors are frequently put for their posterity,
and for children: and the name of the stock or race is put for the
patronymic

Japhet and Shem are put for their posterity (Gen. 9:27).

Jacob and Israel for the Israelitish people (Exo. 5:2. Num. 21:25;
Num. 24:5; Num. 24:17. Deu. 33:28. 1Ki. 18:17-18. Psa. 14:7; Psa.
135:4. Amo. 7:9).

Isaac for the people of Israel (Amo. 7:9).

Esau for the people descended from Esau (Rom. 9:13).

David is put for him who is descended from David; and therefore
especially of the Messiah, who was of the seed of David according to
the flesh (Eze. 34:23). Compare Rom. 1:3; Rom. 9:5.
Abraham is put for Christ by the same figure of Metonymy. “In thee
shall all families of the earth be blessed”: i.e., in Christ (Gen. 12:3;
Gen. 18:18). So Isaac, 26:4; and Jacob, 28:14. This is explained in
Gal. 3:8; Gal. 3:14; Gal. 3:16. Gen. 22:18. Psa. 72:17. Act. 3:25-26.

6. The Writer is put for his writing or book
Luk. 16:29.-“They have Moses (i.e., his writings) and the prophets
(i.e., their writings); let them hear them.”
See Luk. 24:27. Act. 15:21; Act. 21:21. 2Co. 3:15.
7. To this first species of Metonymy must be referred the use of the
word Soul for life, which is the effect of it
Indeed, when so used, the Hebrew déu (nephesh) and the Greek
ψυχή (pseuchee) are often so translated.

See Gen. 9:5; Gen. 37:21. Exo. 4:19. Lev. 17:11. Jdg. 9:17. 1Sa.
26:21. 1Ki. 2:23. Est. 8:11. Psa. 33:19; Psa. 38:12 (13); 56:13 (14).
Jer. 40:14; Jer. 45:5. Lam. 5:9. Jon. 2:6. Mat. 2:20; Mat. 10:39; Mat.
16:25; Mat. 20:28. Joh. 10:17; Joh. 12:25; Joh. 13:37-38; Joh. 15:13,
etc.

8. The Soul is also put for the person, as when we say a city contains
so many thousand souls
We have examples in such phrases as “Praise the Lord, O my soul”
(1Θ., О myself) (Psa. 103:1, etc.); or, “My soul doth (i.e., | myself do)
magnify the Lord” (Luk. 1:46); or, “Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e.,
me) in Sheol” (Psa. 16:10. Act. 2:27; Act. 2:31. See Psa. 49:15.
Hebrews 16). Rev. 6:9 : “I saw the souls of them that were beheaded”:
ie., | saw them (i.e., the persons of them) that were slain.” Compare
20:4.
9. The Soul is also put for the will, affection, or desire, which are its
operations and effects:-
Gen. 23:8. Exo. 23:9. Deu. 23:24. 1Ki. 19:3. Pro. 23:2. Jer. 34:16. Joh.
10:24.
10. The word spirit is sometimes so used for the soul or life in its
manifestations:-
Gen. 45:27. Num. 14:24. Jdg. 8:3. 2Ch. 21:16; 2Ch. 36:22. Ezr. 1:1.
Psa. 76:12 (13); 77:3 (4), 6 (7). Pro. 1:23; Pro. 18:14; Pro. 29:11. Ecc.
7:9. Isa. 29:10. Jer. 51:11. Eze. 13:3. Dan. 2:1; Dan. 2:3. Hag. 1:14.
Rom. 11:8. 1Co. 2:12.
ii. The ORGANIC CAUSE or instrument is put for the thing
effected by it
1. The Organs of Speech are put for the testimony borne
The Mouth is put for the witness or testimony borne by it.
Deu. 17:6.-“At the mouth ({6., on the testimony) of two witnesses or
three shall he ... be put to death.” So Deu. 19:15, and Mat. 18:16.
The Mouth is put for the command or precept given.

Gen. 45:21.-“And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the mouth
(1Θ., commandment, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) of Pharaoh.”
Exo. 17:1.-Israel journeyed “according to the mouth (i.e,
commandment, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) of Jehovah.” So Num. 3:16; Num.
3:39; Num. 20:24; Num. 27:14. Deu. 1:26; Deu. 1:43.
Deu. 34:5.-“So Moses ... died there according to the mouth ({6., the
word) of Jehovah.”

The Targum of Jonathan takes this literally (or as
Anthropopathpoeia, q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ), and interprets it as a
kiss!

The Tongue is put for what is spoken by it.
Psa. 5:9 (10).-“They flatter with their tongue”: i.e., with what it says.
Pro. 25:15.-“A soft tongue (i.e., gentle speech) breaketh the bone”
(1Θ., overcomes obstinacy).

Pro. 10:20.-“The tongue (i.e., the words or speech) of the just is as
choice silver.”

Jer. 18:18.-“Let us smite him with the tongue”: i.e., with hard words.
The Tongue is also put for the language peculiar to any people or
nation.

Act. 2:4.-“They ... began to speak with other tongues”: i.e., in other
languages). So verse 11. Mar. 16:17. 1Co. 14:18.
The Lip is put for the language.

Gen. 11:1.-“And the whole earth was of one lip ({6., language) and of
one speech.”
Pro. 12:19.-“The lip (/е., speech) of truth shall be established for
ever.”

Verse 22: “Lying lips (ie., liars or lies) are abomination to the
Lord.”
Pro. 14:8.-“The lips of knowledge”: i.e., the words of wisdom, or wise
words.
Pro. 17:7.-“Excellent lip (i.e., speech) becometh not a fool; much less
does a lip of lying a prince”: i.e., lying words. So Pro. 18:6-7.
Isa. 33:19.-“A people deeper of lip ({6., speech) than to be
understood.”

The Palate is put for the words spoken.
Pro. 5:3.-“Her palate is smoother than oil”: i.e., her speech.
The Throat also is put for the words spoken.

Psa. 5:9 (10).-“Their throat (i.e., their speech) is an open sepulchre.”
So Rom. 3:13, explained by Luk. 11:44.

2. The Hand is put for the actions performed by it
These are many and various; as finding, counselling, thought,
purpose, impulse, effort, attempt, or care. The “hand” is put by
Metonymy for all these and similar things.
Deu. 32:36.-“When he seeth that their hand was gone.” This is rightly
rendered “power”; for which the “hand” is put by Metonymy.
1Sa. 22:17.-Saul said, “Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord; because
their hand ({6., help) is with David, and because they knew him when
he fled, and did not show it to me”: i.e., the priests helped David with
their counsel, and with food; and by silence, in not betraying him. All
this is contained in, and expressed by, the word “hand.”
2Sa. 3:12.-“My hand (i.e., my help) shall be with thee.”
2Sa. 14:19.-“Is not the hand (i.e., the counsel) of Joab with thee in all
this?”
1Ki. 10:29.-“And so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
Syria, did they bring them out by their hand” (i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , by
their means).
Psa. 7:3 (4).-“O Jehovah my Elohim, if | have done this: if there be
iniquity in my hands”: {6., if | have done iniquity. So Isa. 1:15.

The Hand is also put for instrumentality or agency, especially in

connection with /nspiration.

Ezr. 9:10-11.-“Thy commandments which thou hast commanded by
the hand (i.e, the agency) of thy servants the prophets.”

In all these cases there is an implied reference to testimony
preserved in writing.
Neh. 9:30.-“Thou testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in (or by) the
hand (i.e., the agency) of thy prophets.”
Zec. 7:12.-“The words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in (or by) His
Spirit by the hand of the former prophets”: {6., by their agency.

This is the testimony of one of the latter prophets to the Inspiration
of the “former”: viz., Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.

The Hand is also put for the writing done by it or hand-writing. As we
say of one “he writes a good hand.”
See 1Co. 16:21. Col. 4:18.
The Hand is also put for a gift given to anyone.
Psa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God”:
ie., shall bring presents, as in Psa. 68:29, of which this is the
continuation. As further explained in Psa. 72:10. Isa. 49:7; Isa. 60:6;
Isa. 60:9. Psa. 22:27 (28).

3. The Sword is put for war or for slaughter
Exo. 5:3.-“Lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with sword”: i.e.,
with slaughter.
Lev. 26:6.-“Neither shall the sword (i.e, war) go through your land.”

So Isa. 1:20. Jer. 14:12-13; Jer. 14:15-16; Jer. 43:11. Psa. 144:10.

Rom. 8:35, and many other, passages.
Mat. 10:34.-Ч came not to send peace, but a sword” (i.e., but for war).
That is to say, the object of His coming was peace, but the effect of it
was war.
4. A Line is used for the territory divided up or marked out by it
Amo. 7:17.-“Thy land shall be divided by line”: i.e., divided up among
others.

Mic. 2:5.-“Thou wilt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the
congregation of Jehovah.”

The land in Palestine round each village was divided by lot for the
year, for each family to sow and reap. Referring to this, David says,
“The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places,” and then he goes on
to explain it, “Yea, | have a goodly heritage” (Psa. 16:6).

Hence the word “line” is used of an inheritance measured out See
Deu. 3:4 (where it is rendered “region”). Jos. 17:14. Psa. 105:11 (the
lot of your inheritance).

In this sense Israel was (among the other nations) the line or lot of
Jehovah's inheritance. Deu. 32:8-9.
20ο. 10:16.-“In another man’s line”: /е., in another man’s inheritance
or sphere of labour.

Psa. 19:4 (5).-“Their line is gone out through all the earth.” The A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] interprets the Metonymy incorrectly in the margin, “their rule or
direction.” \t is their inheritance: i.e., the whole earth was the sphere
through which their words and speech went forth, and where the
knowledge imparted by the stars was made known. See Rom. 10:18.*
[Note: And The Witness of the Stars, by the same author and
publisher.]

5. Silver is put for the thing procured by it
Exo. 21:21.-Where a servant is said to be the money of the master.

6. Hyssop is put for the sprinkling which was effected by it
Hyssop ({ό/6) a small humble moss-like shrub (1Ki. 4:33; ΚΙ. 5:13)
used in ceremonial sprinklings. See Lev. 14:4. Num. 19:18, etc.

Psa. 51:7 (9).-“Purge me with hyssop, and | shall be clean”: {6., purge
me with the atoning blood; not with the herb.
iii. The THING or ACTION is put for that which is the effect or
product of it
Some Rhetorists confine Metonymy only to nouns, and deny its
application to verbs. But there seem to be certain words, even verbs,
the use of which cannot otherwise be classed except under the figure
Metonymy: words which, if not actually changed for or strictly used
instead of others, are yet analagous, and have the meaning of another
word taken conventionally with them; so that a thing or action is put for
some effect which is understood as being consequent upon it.

1. In certain NOUNS, where the Feeling or Affection is put for the

effects resulting or proceeding from the feeling
Love is put for the benefits and blessings flowing from it.
1Jn. 3:1.-“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
upon us”: i.e., not merely the feeling of love, but the manifestation of it
in all that it has done for us: one thing here being the calling and
making lost sinners the sons of God, and blessing them with all
spiritual blessings in Christ.
Mercy is put for the offices and benefits which are the outcome of it.

Gen. 20:13.-"This is thy kindness which thou shalt show, etc.”
Gen. 32:10.-“I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all
the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant”: i.e., all the
material and spiritual benefits bestowed in kindness and faithfulness.
2Ch. 35:26.-“Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness”
(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] Heb. kindnesses): i.e., his acts of
kindness.

By the same figure the Greek ἑλεημοσύνη (pity, or mercy) is put for
benefits bestowed upon the poor.
Mat. 6:1.-“Take heed that ye do not your alms.” The R.V. [Note: The

Revised Version, 1881.] and Critical Texts (G. [Note: . Griesbach and

his critical Greek Text.] L. [Note: . Lachmann and his critical Greek

Text.] T. [Note: . Tischendorf and his critical Greek Text.] Tr. [Note: r.

Tregelles and his critical Greek Text.] A. [Note: . Alford and his critical

Greek Text.] ) have δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee), righteousness, instead

of ἐλεημοσύνη (elesmosunee), mercy. The reading doubtless arose

from some scribe’s not seeing the Metonymy, and trying to explain it.
In either case the feeling is put for the acts which manifest it. So

Luk. 11:41. Act. 10:2; Act. 10:4.

Anger and Wrath are put for punishment, and various acts which flow

from them.

Psa. 79:6.-“Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known

thee”: i.e., thy judgments. So 1Sa. 28:18.

Mic. 7:9.-“I will bear the indignation of Jehovah”: ie., the

chastisements which it inflicts.

Rom. 2:5.-Thou “treasurest up unto thyself wrath”: i.e., the judgments

produced by it.
Rom. 4:15.-“The law worketh wrath”: ie., inflicts or executes
punishments and penalties. The word “execute” is actually supplied in
Rom. 13:4.

Rom. 13:5.-“Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath”:
i.e., on account of the effects of the anger, etc., of those who govern,
“but also for conscience sake”: {6., because ye believe it to be right
according to the will of God.

Eph. 5:6.-“For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon
the children of disobedience”: {6., the punishments inflicted by God on
account of His wrath.

Justice is put for the judgment or punishment which manifests it.
Exo. 6:6.-“I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm and with great
justice”: {6., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] , judgments. As rendered in Pro. 19:29.
Eze. 14:21, etc.

It is put also for the actual sentence and condemnation.

Jer. 26:11.-“The judgment (/.e., the sentence) of death is for this man.”
This Metonymy is idiomatically rendered in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So Joh. 3:19
(κρίσις, krisis, the act or process of judging).

Sin and its synonyms are put for the effects or punishment of sin.
Gen. 19:15.-“Lest thou be condemned in the iniquity’: ie.,
punishment, as in margin of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So Psa. 7:16 (17).

Jer. 14:16.- will pour their wickedness upon them”: ie., the
punishment on account of their wickedness.
Zec. 14:19.-“This shall be the sin (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) of
Egypt”: i.e., the punishment for Egypt's sin.

When joined with the verb to bear (i.e., to bear iniquity), it means
to bear the punishment or judgment for iniquity, etc. See Exo. 28:43.
Lev. 5:1; Lev. 20:20; Lev. 22:9. Num. 14:33. Isa. 53:4. Eze. 23:35;
Eze. 23:49; Eze. 18:20.

When Christ is said to bear our sins, it means that He bore
thepunishment (i.e., death) which was due to them. Heb. 9:28. 1Pe.
2:24, etc.
Work is put for the wages paid for it.

Lev. 19:13.-Heb. work; A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , wages.
Jer. 22:13.-“And doth not give him his work”: i.e., Heb. his wage. A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] : “for his work.”
Rom. 11:6.-“If by grace, then is it no more of works”: i.e., of wages or
merit.
Rev. 14:13.-“And their works (i.e., their rewards) do follow with them.”

Divination is put for the money received for it.
Num. 22:7.-“So the elders departed with divinations in their hands.”
Here, both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] do
not scruple to boldly translate the Metonymy and put “the rewards of
divination.”
Labour is put for that which is produced by it.

Deu. 28:33.-“All thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat
up”: {9., all the fruit of thy labours.
Psa. 78:46.-“He gave ... their labour unto the locust”: {6., the fruit of
their labour.
Psa. 105:44.-“They inherited the labour of the people.”
Psa. 128:2.-“Thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands”: i.e., that which
the labour of thy hands has produced.
Pro. 5:10.-“Lest ... thy labours be in the house of a stranger”: i.e., that
which thou hast made or produced.

So Ecc. 2:19. Isa. 45:14. Jer. 3:24. Eze. 23:29.
Strength is put for that which it effects or produces.
Gen. 4:12.-“When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
unto thee her strength”: i.e., her fruits shall not be brought forth freely
and liberally to thee.
Pro. 5:10.-“Lest strangers be filled with thy strength”: i.e., that which
thy strength brings forth. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : wealth.
Hunting is put for the flesh of the animal that is caught.
Gen. 25:28.-“And Isaac loved Esau because hunting was in his
mouth.” Here, the mouth is put for the eating which it performed, and
hunting for the venison which it caught. See also under Ellipsis, page
26.
Gen. 27:3.-‘Hunt me a hunting”: i.e., catch or take for me some
venison (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] ). See Polyptoton, page 275.
2. In certain VERBS
The same Metonymy is seen in certain verbs, but it is confined to
verbs of (a) Knowing, (b) Remembering, (c) Loving and Hating, and
(d) Operation.
(a) Verbs of Knowing
are used of the effect of knowing: i.e., understanding, caring for,
approving, etc.
Job. 19:25.-“I know that my redeemer liveth”: {6., | believe, or have a
saving knowledge of the fact.
Psa. 1:6.-“The Lord knoweth ({6., approveth) the way of the
righteous.” So Rev. 2:24.
Psa. 9:10 (11).-“They that know thy name will put their trust in thee”:
i.e., they that understand Thee as their God and Saviour.
Psa. 35:11.-‘False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
that | knew not”: i.e., things which | was not conscious of, or did not
acknowledge as true. So Psa. 51:3 (5). 2Co. 5:21.
Psa. 90:11.-“Who knoweth ({6., Who rightly considers) the power of
thine anger?” Many may hear of it and know of it in the ordinary sense
of the verb, but who rightly estimates it and understands it?
Pro. 24:23.-“It is not good to know (or discern) faces in (giving) the
judgment”: i.e., to have respect or show favour to them. See Deu. 1:17
(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) and 16:19. Job. 34:19.

Isa. 1:3.-“Israel doth not know.” The next parallel line goes on to
explain it:-“My people doth not consider.” So Jer. 8:7. Luk. 19:42 (cf.
[Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] Psa. 101:4). This comes also
under the figure Exergasia (q.v. [Note: Which see] )

Jer. 9:24.-“Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
and knoweth me”: /.е., loves me and believes me. Compare verses 3
and 6.

Jer. 31:34.-“They shall all know me”: {6., believe in me with a saving
faith.

Joh. 8:43.-“Ye cannot hear (i.e., receive, and understand, and
approve) my word.” See verse 44.
Joh. 10:27.-“My sheep hear my voice, and | know them”: {6., | love
them with all a shepherd’s fondness.
Joh. 17:3.-‘This is life eternal that they might know (i.e., believe on)
thee-the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”
Act. 10:34.-"I perceive (i.e., | now understand and am made to know
from what has taken place) that God is no respecter of persons.”
Rom. 7:15.-“For that which | do | know not.” Here, the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
translates the Metonymy, “that which | do | allow not”: i.e., | do not
approve. The old Eng. of the verb allow is allaud, to praise or approve,
as in Psa. 11:5. Prayer Book (i.e., Coverdale’s) Version: “The Lord
alloweth the righteous”: i.e., approveth him.
1Со. 8:3.-“If any man love God, the same is known of him”: {8., is
loved and cared for by Him (see Heterosis of the verb).

Verbs of Knowing are sometimes put for caring for or manifesting

affection to.

Gen. 39:6.-“He (Potiphar) knew not ought he had”: i.e., had no anxiety
about it.
Exo. 2:25.-“And God knew them”: i.e, as in AV. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , had
respect unto them.
Deu. 33:9.-“Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew ({6.,
cared for) his own children.”

So Rth. 2:10; Rth. 2:19.
Jdg. 2:10.-“There arose another generation after them, which knew
not the Lord”: {.6., which did not care for Him.
1Ch. 17:18.-“Thou knowest (i.e., hast respect to) thy servant.”
Psa. 37:18.-“The Lord knoweth the days of the upright”: ᾖθ., has
respect to them and acts accordingly.
Psa. 142:4 (5).-“There was no man that would know me”: i.e., that
would care for me. See under Ellipsis.
Pro. 12:10.-“A righteous man knoweth the life of his beast”: i.e., he
regardeth and careth for it.
Pro. 29:7.-“The righteous knoweth (A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , considereth) the
cause of the poor.”
Jer. 1:5.-“Before | formed thee in the belly | knew thee”: i.e., cared for

and loved thee.

Jer. 24:5.-“So shall | know (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or

current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , acknowledge) them that are

carried away captive.”

Amo. 3:2.-“You only have | known of all the families of the earth”: i.e.,

loved and cared for. Cf. [Note: f. Compare (for Latin, confer).] Deu.

4:20.

1Th. 5:12.-“We beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour

among you”: i.e., to consider and care for them.

2Ti. 2:19.-“The Lord knoweth (i.e., loves and cares for) them that are

his.” See also under Heterosis.

Verbs of Knowing are used also of experiencing, either by saving faith
or by personal dealing.

Isa. 53:11.-“By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify

many”: i.e., knowledge of Him and the salvation which He gives. See

Luk. 1:77. “To give knowledge of salvation.”

Mat. 7:11.-“If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children,” etc.: i.e., are able, notwithstanding all your innate
blindness, to understand enough, in spite of your selfishness, to give
good gifts, etc.

Mar. 5:29.-“And she knew (ἔγνω) by her body (i.e., by the sensations
of it) that she was healed of that plague”: i.e. (as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ), “she
felt.” She experienced, just as the Lord Himself did in verse 30, where
we have the same verb used of Him: “knowing in Himself” (ἐπιγνούς).
1Co. 4:19.-“But | will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know
(i.e., will find out and expose) not the speech of them which are puffed
up, but the power.”
20ο. 1:9.-“We had the sentence of death in ourselves”: ᾖθ., we
experienced the feelings of those who have had the sentence of death
pronounced upon them.
(b) Verbs of Remembering
are used of a strong desire or wish for the thing mentioned or
remembered.
Isa. 44:21.-“Remember these, O Jacob and Israel ... thou shalt not be
forgotten of me”: i.e., desire the things which make for your peace,
etc.
Eze. 23:19.-“Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to
remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the
harlot in the land of Egypt”: i.e., in desiring again the former sins.
Jon. 2:7 (8).-“When my soul fainted within me, | remembered the
Lord” (and therefore desired Him, and called upon Him).
2Ti. 2:8.-“Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was
raised from the dead according to my Gospel”: i.e., Believe and enjoy,
and rest in, the blessed knowledge of the fact.

Heb. 11:15.-“If they had been mindful of that country from whence
they came out”: i.e., if they had longed for it, or desired to return to it,
they could have done so. This is clear from the verb to “desire” in
verse 16.

So the noun is used of the Lord’s Supper, “in remembrance of Me”:
ie., not a mere calling to mind, but that which is produced by such
remembrance: viz., faith, love, hope, which are all bound up in that
acknowledgment of Christ's death (Luk. 22:19. 1Со. 11:24-25).
Hitherto they had celebrated their deliverance from Egypt. Henceforth
they were to remember Christ, and the exodus which He
accomplished, and to desire His return, looking for it with loving hope.

On the other hand, the verb to forget is used of unfaithfulness, and
rejection.
Hos. 4:6.-“Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, | will also
forget thy children”: i.e., seeing thou hast been unfaithful to me, and
will reject thy children.
(c) Verbs of Loving and Hating
are put for the actions consequent upon them.

To Love is put for to expect, or desire, or take.
Psa. 11:5.-“Him that loveth violence (i.e., and hence practises it) his
soul hateth.”
Pro. 21:17.-“He that loveth (and therefore liveth in) pleasure shall be a
poor man,” etc. He would not be poor unless he gratified his love of
pleasure by spending his substance.
Mat. 6:5.-“They love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the
corners of the streets,” and they do it because they love it.
Luk. 11:43.-“Ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues”: i.e., ye
not only love them, but take them because ye love them.
Joh. 3:19.-“Men loved darkness rather than light”: (and practised, and
lived, and acted, accordingly).
2Ti. 4:8.-“All them also that love His appearing” (and act, and live,
accordingly).
2Ti. 4:10.-“Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world”:
(and returned to it).

To Love is used of the exercise of the greatest possible care for
whatever is the object of the love. While {ο hate is used in the opposite
sense, of exercising less care, or of neglect.
Gen. 29:31.-“And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated”: i.e.,
neglected, and the other more esteemed. See verse 30.
By some this is called Hyperbole (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ).
Joh. 12:25.-“He that loveth his life shall lose it”: {6., that cares more
for his life than for Christ. See under Ellipsis and Hyperbole.
This is the explanation of Mat. 16:25, where it reads, “whosoever
shall save his life”: i.e., shall care more for it, and preserve it, instead
of giving it up for Christ. Compare Luk. 14:26.

To Love is used not merely for the act itself, but for the effect of it.
Psa. 109:17.-“As he loved cursing”: i.e., not merely loved to do it, but
did it.

Pro. 13:24.-“He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth
him chasteneth him betimes”: i.e., his love takes effect, and is seen, in
the chastening.
Pro. 18:19.-“He loveth trangression that loveth strife’: ie, he
trangresses who strives, for He does it because he loves to do it.
Pro. 8:36.-“All they that hate me love death”: i.e., so live and act as to
injure life and accelerate death.
(d) Verbs of Operation
The verb to do often denotes the effect rather than the act.
Gen. 12:5.-“The souls that they had gotten (Heb., made) in Haran”:
ie., the servants which they had acquired in Haran. Thus the
Metonymy is here translated by the word “gotten.”

Gen. 30:30.-“And now when shall | do for my house also?” The A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] translates the Metonymy by the verb “provide”: “when shall |
provide?” etc.

Mat. 25:16.-“He that had received the five talents went and traded
with the same and made them (i.e., gained) other five talents,” as
explained in verse 20.

Certain Verbs have not their own proper signification, but are used of

the actions or effects consequent upon them:
To Judge is put for punish or condemn.

Gen. 15:14.-“That nation whom they serve shall | judge”: i.e., punish
with judgments, not simply rule. Act. 7:7.

2Ch. 20:12.-“O our God, wilt thou not judge them?” i.e., punish them.
Psa. 9:19 (20).-“Let the heathen be judged in thy sight.”
Heb. 13:4.-“Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge”: i.e.,
punish. See also Joh. 3:18 and Rom. 14:3.
To Judge is also used in the sense of acquit, which is also an effect of
judging. See
Psa. 35:24.-“Judge me, О Lord my God”: {6., acquit me.
To Hurt or even to Injure is put for the Aurt or injury done.

Luk. 10:19.-“Nothing shall by any means hurt you”: {Θ., have any
injurious effect upon you.
Rom. 8:31.-“If God be for us, who can be against as?” i.e., who can
hurt us or bring any evils upon us? They can, of course, be “against
us,” but not have any hurtful effect.

iv. The MATERIAL is put for the thing made of or from it

1. Trees are put for arms or instruments made from them
Nah. 2:3 (4).-“The fir-trees shall be terribly shaken.” The context
shows that “trees” are put for the spears, etc., which men make from
them.
2Sa. 6:5.-“And David and all the house of Israel played before the
Lord on all fir-woods.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] both treat this as though it were an Ellipsis: “on all
manner of instruments made of firwood,” instead of seeing the
Metonymy and saying simply, “On all manner of instruments,” which
are immediately mentioned: viz., harps and psalteries. But according
to a note in Dr. Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint reads with all
might and with songs instead of “on all manner of fir-woods.” Compare
verse 14 and 1Ch. 13:8.

2. Brass is put for fetters, etc
Lam. 3:7.-“He hath made my brass heavy”: i.e., my fetters, or bonds,
or chains.

fetters.

ie., fetters, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.]
3. Curtains are put for tents

or tent.
Jer. 4:20.-“Suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtain ({Θ., my
tabernacle or dwelling) in a moment.”
Hab. 3:7.-“And the curtains (i.e., tents) of Midian’s land did tremble.”
4. Corn is put for bread or food generally
Lam. 2:12.-“They say to their mothers, Where is corn (i.e., bread) and
wine?”
5. Gold and Silver and other metals and similar substances are put for
what is made with them
Gen. 23:9.-“That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he
hath, which is in the end of his field, for silver (i.e., money made from
silver) full (i.e., of full value) he shall give it to me in your midst (i.e.,
within your boundaries), for a possession of (i.e., hereditary)
sepulchre.”

Gen. 24:22.-“Of ten gold was their weight”: i.e., bracelets made of
gold, ten shekels in weight.

2Ki. 5:5.-“Six thousand of gold”: i.e., pieces of money.

2Ki. 12:4 (5), where it is rendered “money.”

1Ch. 21:22; 1Ch. 21:24.-“Full silver’: for full money value. In A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] rendered “full price.”

1Ch. 29:2.-Here, the figure is translated by the words “things of’ in
italics. “| have prepared ... the gold for gold (things), and the silver for
silver (things), and the brass for brass (things),” etc.

Psa. 115:4.-“Their idols are silver and gold”: i.e., made of silver and
gold.

Mat. 10:9.-“Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass ({6., money
made from these) in your purses.”

Act. 3:6.-“Silver and gold (i.e., money, like the Scottish “siller’ and
French /’argent) have | none.”
6. Iron is put for things made of it

2Ki. 6:5.-“As one was felling a beam the iron (i.e., the axhead, as the
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] renders it) fell into the water.”
Psa. 105:18.-“Whose foot they hurt with the gyve, his soul came into
iron”: i.e., he was fast bound with iron chains.

7. Stones are put for things made of them
Exo. 7:19.-“Both in woods and in stones”: {6., both in wooden vessels
and stone vessels.
Deu. 25:13.-“Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers stones”: i.e.,
weights. Heb., a stone and a stone.
Pro. 11:1.-“A perfect stone (i.e., a just weight) is his delight.”
Isa. 34:11.-“The stones of emptiness’: i.e., the stones which
characterize waste land.
Jer. 2:27.-“Saying ... to a stone (i.e., to an idol), Thou hast brought me
forth” Jer. 3:9.
Zec. 4:10.-“They shall see the stone of tin (i.e, the plummet) in
Zerubbabel’s hand.”

8. Wood is put for things made of wood
See above Exo. 7:19 (for vessels). Isa. 44:19. Jer. 2:27; Jer. 3:9; Jer.
10:8. Hos. 4:12 (for idols).
Eze. 37:16.-“Take thee one wood and write upon it, ‘For Judah and for
the children of Israel his companions’: then take another wood, and
write upon it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house
of Israel his companions’ ”: i.e., take a tablet or stick made out of
wood.
Gen. 40:19.-“Shall hang thee on a tree”: {6., a gallows. So Jos. 8:29.
Deu. 21:22-23. Est. 7:9-10. Gal. 3:13. 1Pe. 2:24.
2Sa. 21:19.-“The wood ({6., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,
or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “staff’) of whose spear
was like a weaver’s beam.”
Act. 16:24.-“And made their feet fast in the wood”: i.e “in the stocks,”
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.]
9. Flax is put for the wick made of it

Isa. 42:3.-“The smoking flax (i.e., wicks) shall he not quench.” See
under Tapeinosis.
Isa. 43:17.-“They are quenched as the flax”: /е., as a wick. (A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
161411, tow).

Gen. 18:27.-“Dust and ashes.” See under Paronomasia.
Psa. 103:14.-“He remembereth that we are dust”: {6., made of dust.

was.”
11. Seed is put for son or posterity

Gen. 4:25.-“God ... hath appointed me another seed”: i.e., son.

Gen. 15:13.-“Thy seed shall be a stranger,” etc. So Act. 7:6; where the
period of sojourning is stated to be 400 years. Whereas, in Exo. 12:40,
and Gal. 3:17, where the period refers not to the sojourning of
Abraham's seed (which could not commence till Isaac was born, thirty
years after the promise), but includes that of Abraham himself, the
sum is given as 430 years.

12. Forest or wood is put for the houses, etc., made of its trees
Jer. 21:14; Jer. 22:7 : compare these with Jer. 52:13. 2Ki. 25:9 and
2Ch. 36:19, and the figures in the last two passages will be explained.

Il. Metonymy of the Effect
This is when the effect is put for the cause producing it. It is of four
kinds: (i.) The action for the actor. (ii.) The thing for the organic cause
of it. (iii.) The effect for the producer of it. (iv.) The matter made for the
material cause of it. We will consider these in their order:-
i. The ACTION or the EFFECT for the person producing the effect,
or for the author of it

1. Nouns
Gen. 25:23.-“Two nations are in thy womb”: i.e., two infants whose
progeny should become two different nations.
Gen. 26:35.-“Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah”:
ie., the source of much sorrow to them.
Gen. 49:18.-“I have waited for thy salvation (i.e., for Him who shall
bring and work salvation), O Lord.”
Neh. 12:31; Neh. 12:38; Neh. 12:40.-“Two great celebrations.” The
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have
supplied the words implied by the Metonymy (the former in italics, the
latter in roman type), by rendering “two great companies of them that
gave thanks.” The effect of the praises or thanks, is put for the people
who rendered them.
Psa. 18:1 (2).-“I will love thee, О Jehovah my strength”: i.e., the
author and source of my strength. So Psa. 22:19 (20). Jer. 16:19.
Psa. 27:1.-“The Lord is my light and my salvation.” This is not a
Metaphor but a Metonymy: i.e., Jehovah is the source of my light, and
the author of my salvation. Compare Heb. 5:9.

Psa. 106:20.-“Thus they changed their glory (i.e., God) into the
similitude of an ox that eateth grass.”

The Massorah records this as one of the passages in which the
Sopherim changed the pronoun “my” into “their.” It was thought to be
too gross an anthropomorphism to say “my,” Jehovah being the
speaker. See Appendix E.

Isa. 49:6.-“That thou mayest be my salvation (i.e., the Saviour whom |
have sent) unto the end of the earth.”

Jer. 23:6.-“Jehovah our Righteousness”: ᾖθ., the Author of our
righteousness: our Justifier.

Mar. 9:17; Mar. 9:25.-“A dumb spirit”: i.e., a spirit which produced the
effect of dumbness in the person possessed.
Luk. 11:14.-“And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb”: i.e., it
produced dumbness in the man possessed. Compare Mat. 9:32-33.
Mar. 9:17; Mar. 9:25.

Luk. 2:30.-“Mine eyes have seen thy salvation”: i.e., Christ the
Saviour: the Worker and Author of Salvation. Luk. 3:6 and Isa. 49:6.
Luk. 13:11.-“And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of
infirmity.” The negative uf (mee) implies that she felt unable to
straighten herself up,* [Note: The Greek of this is jie <6 otic 7 (eis
to panteles), which occurs only here and Heb. 7:25. Here, to her full
height; there, to their full need.] and indicates some nervous disorder.
So the Lord uses the remarkable language about Satan as binding
her.

This is not Enallage, “an infirm spirit,” but it is Metonymy, by which
the effect is put for the cause. The woman was troubled by a spirit
which caused or produced this infirmity.

Joh. 11:25.-“l am the resurrection and the life”: i.e., the Worker of
resurrection, and the Giver of resurrection life.

Rom. 13:3.-“Rulers are not a terror”: {.6., a source of terror.

2Со. 1:14.-“We are your rejoicing (i.e., cause of rejoicing), even as ye
also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.” So 1Th. 2:19-20.
Rev. 1:12.-“And | turned to see the voice (/е., Him) that spake with
me.” So Joh. 1:23.

2. Verbs
Gen. 42:38.-“Shall ye bring down,” etc.: {6., shall be the cause of my
death. See under Periphrasis.
Gen. 43:6.-“Why have ye done evil to me, to disclose to the man that
ye had yet another brother?” {6., why have you brought or caused all
this evil to be brought upon me.
Exo. 23:8.-“The gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the
righteous”: i.e., is an occasion by which these effects are produced.
1Ki. 18:9.-“What have | sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant
(i.e., cause to be delivered) into the hand of Ahab to slay me?”
Psa. 76:10 (11).-“Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee”: i.e., shall
be the occasion of praise to thee.
Isa. 43:24.-“Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins”: i.e., thy sins
have caused the hard service and Passion which | endured on
account of them.
Jer. 38:23.-“Thou shalt burn this city with fire”: i.e., thou shalt cause it
to be burnt. See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] margin.
Eze. 19:7.-“He laid waste their cities”: i.e., their sins caused them to
be destroyed.
Act. 1:18.-“Now this man purchased (i.e., caused to be purchased) a
field.”
Rom. 14:15.-“Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died”:
ie., do not be a cause of destruction.
1Co. 7:16.-“For what knowest thou, О wife, whether thou shalt save
(i.e., be the means of salvation or the occasion of much blessing to)
thy husband?” etc. See 1Pe. 3:1.
ii. The THING EFFECTED by an instrument for the instrument or
organic cause of it

Gen. 49:6.-Lit., “My soul (i.e., myself, I) will not come into their secret
(counsel), mine honour shall not be with them in their assembly.”

Here, “honour” is put for the tongue which gives it; and it means
that he would not honour them by speaking or taking part in their
assembly. Compare Psa. 57:8; Psa. 108:1.

Deu. 24:6.-“No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to
pledge: for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.” Here “life,” the effect, is
put for the means of livelihood by which the life is preserved.

Psa. 7:5 (6).-“Let him ... lay mine honour in the dust”: /.e., myself who
gives honour.

Psa. 16:9.-“Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth”: {6.,
my tongue gives glory, as is explained in Act. 2:26.
Psa. 30:12 (13).-“To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and
not be silent.”

Here, the word “glory” may be put for the tongue which gives it: but
the structure of the Psalm suggests another explanation of the
Metonymy. This verse corresponds, in the structure, with verse 4:
“Sing to Jehovah, O ye saints of His.” Compare 2Co. 8:23.

So that verse 12 would be “To the end that Thy saints may sing
praise to Thee”: “glory” being put for the saints who give the glory.
Psa. 57:8 (9).-“Awake up, my glory”: i.e., my tongue, wake up and
glorify God.

Pro. 27:27.-“And thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for
the food of thy household, and for the life (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )
of thy maidens”: i.e., as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it, “for the
maintenance of thy maidens.”

Mar. 12:44.-“She of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her
living (or life)”: i.e., all her means of supporting herself in life.

Luk. 15:12.-“And he divided unto them his living (or life)’: /е., his
means or property, by which life is sustained. So Mar. 12:44.
Act. 17:31.-Lit., “Whereof he hath given faith to all men.” Here faith,
the effect, is put for the proofs or evidence on which it rests. “Whereof
He hath afforded evidence unto all men”: and then the evidence or
proof is stated, “in that he hath raised him from the dead.” The A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] well render it
“hath given assurance.”

The Resurrection of Christ is the evidence God affords of His
purpose to judge the world by Him.
Rom. 1:16.-“For it [the gospel] is the power of God unto salvation to
every one that believeth”: i.e., the belief is the effect of the power of
God through the preaching of the gospel.
1Jn. 5:4.-“This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith.” “Victory,” the effect, is put for “our faith,” which accomplishes it.
From Eph. 6:16 we learn that it is through Christ; who is the shield
which faith uses.

iii. The EFFECT for the thing or action causing or producing it
(a) In Nouns
Exo. 10:17.-“Intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from
me this death only”: i.e., this plague which is causing death.
Deu. 30:15.-“I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
and evil”: {6., good things which end in life, and evil things which end
in death. So in Deu. 32:47, and Jer. 21:8, etc.
2Ki. 4:40.-“There is death in the pot”: i.e., there is that which produces
death as the effect of eating it. How forcible is this Metonymy, by the
use of which time is saved, and perhaps life too.
Pro. 10:2.-“Righteousness delivereth from death”: {6., from the things
that end in death.
Pro. 19:13.-“A foolish son is the calamity of his father”: i.e., does that
which brings or produces calamity.
Pro. 20:1.-“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.”

Here, wine, etc., is put for its effects. It brings him who drinks to
excess into derision, and causes tumults.
Ecc. 11:1.-“Cast thy bread (i.e., the seed which produces it) upon the
waters.”
Isa. 28:12.-‘This is the rest”: i.e., this is what gives rest.
Jer. 3:24.-“For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers”: i.e.,
the worship of Baal, which brought upon them shame and sorrow.
Shame is put for an idol or for idolatry in Jer. 11:13 (see margin). Hos.
9:10. See also Jer. 48:13, etc.

Lam. 2:14.-“Thy prophets have seen vain things for thee and
expulsions”: {6., the things which led to expulsion from the land and
captivity.
Eze. 44:18.-“They shall not gird themselves with sweat”: {6., as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] , with anything that causeth sweat. The effect “sweat” being put
for the garments which cause it.

Hos. 4:18.-“Their drink is rebellious, or turned aside”: i.e., has caused
them to turn aside from God. Through not seeing the Metonymy, the
translators try to find other meanings for nf (see text and margin).
The verse refers to Isa. 28:1; Isa. 5:11.

Mic. 1:5.-“What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And
what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?” i.e.,
Samaria and Jerusalem were the cause of the transgression of
Israel:-“What is the cause of Jacob's trangression?”

Hab. 2:5.-“Yea, also because the wine transgresseth”: i.e., the effects
of the wine was transgression; or, “Yea, so surely as wine causeth
trangression.”

Joh. 3:19.-“And this is the judgment”: i.e., the cause of which
judgment or condemnation was the effect: viz., “that light is come into
the world, and men loved darkness rather than light,” etc.

Joh. 12:50.-“And | know that his commandment is life everlasting”:
ie., the effect of it is eternal life.
Joh. 17:3.-“This is life eternal”: i.e., the effect of it is life eternal.

Rom. 6:6.-“The body of sin” is more than “sinful body.” It is more than
mere character. The effect is put for the cause; which is the old nature,
that, through the body, works out sin; and sin is the effect; which is
thus used, here and in other parts of this epistle (chap. 5:12-8:39), for
the old nature itself.

Whereas, in chaps, 1:16-5:11, we have “sins,” as the product of
the Old nature, and the fruit of the old tree, we have, in 5:11-8:39,
“sin,” or the Old nature, which causes and commits the “sins”; and the
old tree itself which produces the fruits.

Rom. 7:7.-15 the law sin? (1.е., Is sin the effect of the law?) God
forbid. But yet | knew not sin except through the law!”

There is no “nay” in the Greek. The word “but” brings out the
meaning: “God forbid that sin should be the effect of the law. But
nevertheless.” So it is.

Rom. 7:24.-“The body of this death”; or, by Hypallage (q.v. [Note:
Which 5εε.]), as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] margin, “this body of death”: in which
case, “of death” is either, by Enallage, put for the adjective “dying,” or
it may be the Metonymy of the effect, and the result “death” put for the
cause-viz., all that leads up to, and ends in, death.

Rom. 8:6.-“To be carnally minded is death (i.e., the cause of death),
but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (i.e., ends in life and
peace or peaceful life).” So verse 10.

1Со. 12:6.-“And there are diversities of operations”: {6., of faculties
and gifts effected by the Divine operations.

1Co. 14:3.-“He that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and
exhortation, and comfort”: /е., words which build up, exhort, and
comfort.

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] obtains this meaning by supplying the word “to.”
2Co. 1:10.-“Who delivered us from so great a death”: i.e., from the
persecution or trouble which threatened to kill them, and end in death.
20ο. 11:23.-“In deaths oft.” This cannot, of course, mean that he had
died more than once; but that he had often been at death’s door, and
in troubles which cause or bring about death.
Php. 1:13.-“My bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace”: i.e., the
effect of his preaching made it manifest that his bonds were on
account of his service for Christ, and not for any crimes.
Heb. 6:1.-“Dead works”: /е., works wrought by the Old nature. So
Heb. 9:14, according to Rom. 6:23.
Rev. 6:8.-“And power was given unto them ... to kill with the sword,
and with hunger, and with death”: i.e., with pestilence which produced
death.

(b) In Verbs
Psa. 25:2.-“O my God, | trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not
mine enemies triumph over me” (and thus be a cause of my being put
to shame). So verse 20. Psa. 31:1 (2);Psa. 119:116, etc.
Psa. 70:4 (5).-“Let them rejoice and be glad in Thee, all that seek
thee”: i.e., let there be a cause of rejoicing and gladness to all seeking
thee. Through not seeing the Metonymy the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] render it: “Let all those that
seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee.”
The cause and effect are joined together in Psa. 5:11 (12), 12 (13).
Isa. 28:16.-“Не that believeth shall not make haste.”

Here, hastening away or flight is put as the effect for the confusion
and shame which is the cause of it. See Rom. 9:33; Rom. 10:11. 1Pe.
2:6, where the cause is put. The sense is that he that believeth will
have no need of hurried flight, he will wait God’s time.

iv. The THING MADE, for the material from which it is made or

produced

Psa. 74:15.-“Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood”: ᾖ6., the
rock from which the fountain flowed.
Isa. 28:28.-“Bread is bruised”: i.e., the corn of which it is made. The
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] supplies “corn.” The sense is clear from verse 27 and
Job. 28:5. In Psa. 104:14, we have the opposite of this in the
Metonymy of the cause.
Isa. 33:12.-“And the people shall be as the burnings of lime”: i.e., as
fuel for lime-kilns.
Isa. 47:2.-‘Take the millstones and grind meal”: i.e., grind corn, from
which meal is made.
Ill. Metonymy of the Subject
The third division of Metonymy is when the subject is put for the
adjunct: i.e., for some circumstance pertaining to (or joined to) the
subject: e.g., as when the place, or thing containing it, is put for that
which is contained: the possessor for the thing possessed, etc. It is
divided into the five following heads:-
i. The SUBJECT (i.e., the Thing or Action) for that which is
connected with it (i.e., the adjunct)
1. Nouns
Gen. 3:7.-“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew
that they were naked.” They knew this fact before: but they did not
know all that was connected with it. Their nakedness, after the fall,
received a new meaning.
1Sa. 1:15 - ... have poured out my soul before the Lord”: i.e., my
desires and longings.
1Ch. 12:38.-“All these ... came with a perfect heart”: {6., affections
and desires.
Psa. 7:9.-“God trieth the hearts and reins”: /е., the thoughts and
affections and desires. This is clear from Psa. 51:6 (8); 73:11. Pro.
23:7.
Psa. 16:7.-“My reins (/е., my thoughts) also instruct me in the night
season.”
Psa. 26:2.-“Examine me, О Lord, and prove me: try my reins (/е., my
thoughts) and my heart.”

See also Jer. 11:20; Jer. 17:10; Jer. 20:12. Rev. 2:23.
Psa. 38:8 (9).-“l have roared by reason of the disquietness of my
heart” (i.e., my thoughts).
Psa. 62:9.-“Pour out your heart before Him”: i.e., your thoughts and
desires. So Lam. 2:19.
Psa. 62:10 (11).-“Set not your heart (i.e., your affections) upon them.”
Pro. 6:32.-“Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh heart.”
(So Heb., see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] margin). Here heart is put for
“understanding,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ; because it is spoken of as the seat
of wisdom and understanding. See Pro. 2:10; Pro. 8:5; Pro. 11:29;
Pro. 15:14; Pro. 16:21.
Pro. 7:7.-“A young man void of heart”: i.e., of understanding.

It is so used in Pro. 9:4; Pro. 9:16; Pro. 10:13; Pro. 10:21.
Pro. 15:32.-“He that heareth reproof possesseth an heart”: /.е., as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin, getteth understanding.
Pro. 16:23.-“The heart (i.e., the desires and thoughts) of the wise
maketh wise his mouth”: i.e., his words, by Metonymy of the cause.
See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin.
Pro. 22:17.-“Apply thine heart (i.e., thy thoughts and powers) unto my
knowledge.”
Pro. 26:7.-“The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
mouth of fools.” So A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.]

R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “The legs of the lame
hang loose!” The Heb. is: “The legs of the lame are lifted up” (see A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] margin). Here “legs” are put for the clothes which being lifted
up expose the lameness. So when a fool attempts to utter a parable,
he soon exposes himself.

Pro. 28:26.-“He that trusteth in his own heart (i.e., understanding) is a
fool.”

Isa. 5:21.-“Woe unto them that are ... prudent before their face”: .e.,
in themselves or in their own view of matters. See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin.

Isa. 49:16.-“I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands”: i.e., as
indelible as the lines graven in the palms of the hands, (with which we
are born) will be My remembrance of thee.

Jer. 12:2.-“Thou art near in their mouth (i.e., their words, Met. of
cause), and far from their reins” (i.e., their affections, Met. of subject).
See Isa. 29:13.

Hos. 4:11.-“Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart”:
ie., the understanding. That this is meant is clear from chap. 5:11.
Hos. 7:11.-“Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart”: i.e., without
understanding.

Mat. 6:21.-“Where your treasure is, there will your heart (i.e., your
thoughts and affections) be also.”

Mat. 16:19.-“Whatsoever thou ({6., by the word which thou shalt
minister) shalt bind (see Met. of Adjunct below) on earth.” So Mat.
18:18. Whatever this refers to, Peter had neither the power nor the
authority to pass it on to any one else.

Mat. 24:45.-“Who then (i.e., how great and blessed and happy) is a
faithful and wise servant?”

Joh. 20:23.-“Whose soever sins ye (i.e., by the word which ye
minister) remit.” See below under verbs. Whatever this may mean, it
was spoken to the apostles: and it is certain that they had no
commission, authority, or power to pass on that gift to others.

Act. 1:11.-“This same Jesus, which is taken up from you”: i.e., from
your presence and company. So verse 22.

Act. 1:24.-“Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts (/.e., the thoughts) of
all men,” etc. See Psa. 139:2; Psa. 139:4.
Rom. 6:6.-“Our old man is (Gr., was) crucified with him”: i.e., not a
man really, but our Old nature derived from Adam: our old self with its
desires and qualities and conditions. So Eph. 4:22. Compare Rom.
6:12; Rom. 7:5; Rom. 7:7-8. 2Co. 7:1. Heb. 12:1.
Rom. 15:24.-“If first | be somewhat filled with you”: i.e., your company,
etc., as expressed in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin and verse 32.
Rom. 16:3; Rom. 16:7.-“My helpers in Christ Jesus”: i.e., in the
service of Christ.
20ο. 5:17.-“If any man be in Christ he is a new creature”: i.e., he has
a new nature created within him. Thus a new standing is given to him,
with new thoughts and desires, etc. So Eph. 4:24. Compare Rom.
12:2; Rom. 8:2; Rom. 8:5. 1Pe. 3:4 and Rom. 7:22. 2Co. 4:16.
Gal. 4:15.-“Where is then the blessedness ye spake of”: ᾖθ., how
great was that blessedness ye spake of! for, etc.
Php. 1:21.-“To me to live is Christ’: /е., to serve Christ, to work and
labour for Him.

2. Verbs
Where the action is put for the declaration concerning it: or where
what is said to be done is put for what is declared, or permitted, or
foretold as to be done: or where an action, said to be done, is put for
the giving occasion for such action.

Gen. 2:7.-See below, under Deu. 9:1.

Gen. 27:37.-“Behold, | have made him (Jacob) thy lord”: /е., | have
blessed him; and this was part of the blessing.

Gen. 30:13.-“The daughters will call me blessed”: i.e., | am now a
mother. For the parallels to this see Psa. 72:17. Luk. 1:48.

Gen. 34:12.-“Ask me never so much dowry and gift”: /.е., ask me to
give never so much, etc.

Gen. 35:12.-“And the land which | gave Abraham and Isaac”: i.e.,
which | promised to give, or gave in promise.

Gen. 41:13.-“Me he restored (i.e., declared that | should be restored)
unto mine office, and him he hanged (i.e., declared he should be
hanged).”

Exo. 13:2.-“Sanctify unto me all the first-born”: i.e., declare in My
name to the People that | sanctify (i.e., separate) them, etc. Which
Moses did in verses 11 and 12.
Exo. 20:7.-“The Lord will not make him guiltless”: i.e., will not declare
or pronounce. Or “hold,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

Lev. 13:3.-“And the priest shall look on him, and he shall be unclean
(or “uncleanse him,” for the verb is in the Piel)”: {θ., “he shall
pronounce him unclean,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

Deu. 9:1.-“Hear, О Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day”: i.e.,
it is declared this day that thou art to pass over Jordan.

With this passage compare Gen. 2:17 : “In the day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die”: {6., not that he should die in that day,
but it should be declared “in that day”: i.e., thou shalt be sentenced to
die.
2Sa. 7:22.-“Wherefore thou art great”: {6., | will declare and praise
Thee as great: or, Thou shalt be known as great.

See other examples in Isa. 8:13. Jer. 1:5; Jer. 1:10. Eze. 13:19;
Eze. 20:26.

Isa. 6:10.-“Make the heart of this people fat”: i.e., declare that it shall
become so. (Isaiah could not make it fat, etc.) So Mat. 13:14. Mar.
4:12. Luk. 8:10. Joh. 12:40. Act. 28:26-27. Rom. 11:8.

Jer. 1:10.-“I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
kingdoms, to root out (i.e., to declare that they shall be rooted out),
and to pull down (i.e., to prophesy that they shall be pulled down), and
to destroy ({6., to declare that they shall be destroyed), and to throw
down (i.e., to foretell that they shall be thrown down),” etc.
Jer. 4:10.-“Then said 1, Ah, Lord God (Adonai-Jehovah)! surely thou
hast vehemently (or verily) deceived this people (i.e., prophesied that
this People shall be deceived), saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas
the sword reacheth unto the soul.”

The people deceived themselves, assuring themselves that they
should have peace (see chap. 5:12). The Lord had declared by his
prophet that they would so deceive themselves, and so it came to
pass that they were permitted to be deceived by their false prophets.
Jer. 38:23.-“Thou shalt burn this city with fire”: /.е., thou shalt declare
that it shalt be burnt. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it cause it to be burnt, as
though it were the Metonymy of the effect. It is clearly the Metonymy
of the subject: for Zedekiah was not personally to set light to the city!
Eze. 13:19.-“And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of
barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die
and to save the souls alive that should not live”: to prophesy (falsely)
that they should die, and to promise life to those who should not live.
Eze. 13:22.-“Ye have ... strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
should not return from his wicked way, by quickening him”: i.e., by
promising him life. See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.
Eze. 20:25-26.-“Wherefore | gave them also statutes that were not
good, and judgments whereby they should not live (i.e., | permitted
them to receive such statutes from the heathen); And | polluted them
in their own gifts,” etc.: ie., | suffered them to pollute themselves
inthose gifts which, by the Law, they ought to have dedicated to Me.
See under Antanaclasis.
Hos. 6:5.-“Therefore have | hewed them by the prophets (i.e., | have
declared by the prophets that they shall be hewed); | have slain them
by the words of my mouth ({6., | have foretold by the words of my
mouth that they shall be slain).”
Mat. 6:13.-“And lead us not into temptation”: i.e., suffer us not to be
led.
Mat. 16:19.-“Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth ({6., declare to be
binding as a precept, etc.), shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth (i.e., declare to be not binding) shall be
loosed in heaven.” But note that, whatsoever this may mean, it is
nowhere stated that the apostle had either authority or power to
transmit the gift to others; still less to transmit the power to others to
give this gift! And in any case it refers to the “kingdom” and not to the
“Church.” See also chap. 18:18.
Luk. 7:29.-“And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans
justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John”: i.e., declared
God to be just, and praised him for His justice and goodness; in that
they humbled themselves in confession of sin and were baptized by
John. So the word is used again in verse 35 and chaps, 10:29; 16:15,
etc.

Joh. 20:23.-“Whose soever sins ye remit (i.e., declare to be remitted)
they are remitted unto them: and whose soever sins ye retain ({6.,
declare to be retained) they are retained.”

Here note that the apostles had neither the authority nor the power
to transmit this gift; still less to transmit the power to others to give it.
Act. 10:15.-“What God hath cleansed”: ie., declared to be
(ceremonially) clean: as is clear from verse 28.

Rom. 7:9.-“But when the commandment came”: j.e., when its power
was declared in revealing my impotence to obey it, I, in my
experience, suffered its penalty-death. See Gal. 3:23, below.
2Со. 3:6.-“The letter killeth”: i.e., the Law of God manifests its power,

in convincing of sin, and causing the sinner to condemn himself to

death, which is the wages of sin. Compare Rom. 7:10, and Hos. 6:5.

Gal. 3:23.-“Before faith came”: i.e., before the Gospel was declared,

and brought a new object for faith.

Jam. 2:21.-“Was not Abraham our father justified by works?” ie.,

declared to be justified. See verse 23 and Gen. 22:12. So also verses

24, 25.

Jam. 2:22.-“By works was faith made (i.e., declared to be, or

manifested to be) perfect”: {6., true and sincere.

ii. The CONTAINER for the contents: and the PLACE for the thing
placed in it

1. Circuit is so put in all these cases for what is contained within

it

Num. 22:4.-“Now shall all this company lick up all our circuit”: {.6., “all

that are round about us” (as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or

current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ).

Ezr. 1:6.-“And all their circuit”: i.e., all that were about them.
2. Basket is put for its contents
Deu. 28:5.-“Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough” (and
verse 17 contra). Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has translated the latter
Metonymy, but not the former. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] has translated neither. The container is put for the contents.
Here, probably, the “basket” is put for the seed, and “kneading-trough”
for the meal; the beginning and the end of their labours.

3. Wilderness is put for the wild beasts in it

Psa. 29:8.-“The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness”: i.e., the
people and animals or inhabitants of the wilderness, as is clear from
the next verse, and Deu. 8:15.

4. House is put for household
Gen. 7:1.-“Come thou and all thy house (i.e., thy family) into the ark.”
Gen. 30:30.-“When shall | provide for mine own house (i.e., family)
also?”

Gen. 43:16.-Joseph ... “said to the ruler of his house”: {6., of his
servants. We use the word “establishment” in the same way: as the
French also use “ménage.”

Exo. 1:21.-God “made them houses”: i.e., families, or progeny.

Exo. 2:1.-“And there went a man of the house (i-e., lineage) of Levi.”
2Sa. 7:11.-“Jehovah telleth thee that make thee an house will
Jehovah”: i.e., a posterity, especially referring to Christ, Who should
be of “the seed of David,” and sit on His throne for ever. Luk. 1:31-33.
Observe the Figure Epanadiplosis in the above rendering of the
Hebrew.

1Ch. 10:6.-“So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
together” (i.e., all his family), as explained in 1Sa. 31:6.

Psa. 49:11 (12).-“Their inward thought is that their houses (i.e., their
families) shall continue for ever.”

Isa. 36:3.-“Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was
over the house”: ᾖ6., the servants, or household.

Eze. 3:1.-“Go speak unto the house (i.e., the descendants) of Israel.”
The margin of Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible gives another reading: “sons.”
Eze. 27:14.-“They of the house of Togarmah”: i.e., of Togarmah’s
descendants. See Gen. 10:3.

Luk. 19:9.-“This day is salvation come to this house”: i.e., to
Zacchzeus and his family.

Act. 10:2.-Cornelius ... “feared God with all his house”: {6., all his
family or household.

1Co. 1:16.-Here the Greek word “house” is rendered “household”: {6.,
family.

1Ti. 3:4.-“One that ruleth well his own house”: {6., his own family.

2Ti. 3:6.-“For of this sort are they that creep into houses”: i.e.,
families.

2Ti. 4:19.-Here the Greek, “house,” is rendered “household”: {6.,
family.

Tit. 1:11.-“Who subvert whole houses”: {6., families.
Heb. 11:7.-“Noah ... prepared an ark to the saving of his house”: i.e.,
of his family.

5. Islands are put for their inhabitants
Isa. 41:1.-“Keep silence before me, О islands”: /.е., the inhabitants of
the islands. So Isa. 42:4; and Isa. 51:5.

6. Table is put for the things on it
Psa. 23:5.-“Тпои preparest a table before me”: i.e., the good things
upon it. As, when we say that such an one “keeps a good table,” we
mean that it is spread bountifully.
Psa. 78:19.-“Can God (6, the name of concentrated power) furnish
(Heb., order, see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) a table in the
wilderness?”: i.e., set the things upon it.
Under this head comes also

Hos. 14:2 (3).-“So will we render the calves of our lips.”
Here, note first, that the word “render” is uéi (shilem), to offer or
pay a vow. Next, that the word “calves” means oxen; i.e., the animals
used in sacrifice.

Then we have two Metonymies. First, oxen are put (by Metonymy
of the subject) for the sacrifices offered; and then the lips are put (by
Metonymy of the cause) for the confession made by them. So that the
verse really should read: “So shall we offer our sacrifices of
confession and prayer”; being exactly what is expressed in Psa. 51:17
(19). “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, etc.,” and Heb. 13:15 :
“By him ... let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is,
the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” See also Psa. 69:30
(31), 31 (32); 116:17; 141:2.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , while trying to
improve the translation, misses both Metonymies: “So will we render
as bullocks the offering of our lips’-retaining the “letter” (“bullocks” and
“lips”) and missing the “spirit” (sacrifices and confession).

Heb. 13:10.-“We have an altar”: i.e., a sacrifice, referring to the sin-
offering which was burned without the camp including the skin and the
dung, no soul having a right to eat of it. So Christ is our sin-offering
offered without the gate. That it is a figure is clear, for the verse reads
on: “We have an altar, whereof (ἐξ οὗ, ex hou, of which) they have no
right to eat which serve the Tabernacle.” People do not eat “altars”!
The word “altar’ must, therefore, be used by Metonymy for the
sacrifices offered upon it, which were eaten.

But, here, it is the sin-offering which is referred to, which no one
might eat; and therefore those who continued still “served the
tabernacle” could have no part in Christ as the sin-offering.

7. Mountain is put for mountainous region
Jos. 13:6.-“Mountain” is put for a mountainous region, translated here
“hill country.” See Jdg. 7:24.
Jdg. 3:27; Jdg. 7:24.-“Mountain of Ephraim’: Mount Ephraim is put
for the mountainous region of Ephraim.
Mountains are also put for idols worshipped there; or for their
inhabitants.
Jer. 3:23.-"Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from
the multitude of mountains.” Here, “mountains” and “hills” are put for
the idols which were worshipped there. See Eze. 18:6; Eze. 18:11;
Eze. 18:15.
Mic. 1:4.-“And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the
valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are
poured down a steep place.” From a comparison with Psa. 68:2 and
1Ch. 12:15 (16) it seems that “mountains” and “valleys” are here put
for their inhabitants. So Psa. 97:5.
8. The World is put for its inhabitants

Joh. 3:16.-“God so loved the world”: i.e., the inhabitants of the world,
now without distinction. Before it was only Israel without exception.
See further under Synecdoche.
2Co. 5:19.-“Reconciling the world (i.e., the inhabitants of the world)
unto himself.”
41Jn. 2:2.-“He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but
also for the whole world”: i.e., for all the inhabitants of the world
without distinction; as shown by the use of the word for “ours” (which
is ἡμέτερος (heemeteros) and not ἡμῶν (heemapn), of us: i.e., “our,”
as in the previous clause).

Heemeteros denotes that which is peculiarly ours as distinct from
others’. See Act. 2:11; Act. 24:6; Act. 26:5. Rom. 15:4. 2Ti. 4:15. Tit.
3:14. 1Jn. 1:3.

See also under Synecdoche and Ellipsis.
1Jn. 5:19.-“The whole world (i.e., all the inhabitants of the world) lieth
in [the power of] the wicked one.” See under Ellipsis.

9. The World is put for a portion of its inhabitants
Joh. 1:10.-“The world knew him not”: {6., people of the world.
Joh. 3:17.-“That the world through him might be saved”: i.e., people in
the world without distinction.

Joh. 6:33.-“The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,

and giveth life unto the world”: i.e., to God’s People in the world.
Compare verse 51. Hence Joh. 1:9; Joh. 3:17.

Joh. 7:7.-“The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth”: ie., the

inhabitants of the world, as without God.

Joh. 14:17.-“The Spirit of truth; whom the world (i.e., men) cannot

receive.” So Joh. 15:19; Joh. 16:20; Joh. 16:33; Joh. 17:9; Joh. 17:14,

etc.

Joh. 14:31.-“But that the world may know that | love the Father’: i.e.,

that the godly in the world. Hence Joh. 1:9 : “That was the true light,

which, coming into the world (i.e., among men), lighteth every man,”

without distinction of race or language, etc.; as heretofore only Israel,

not without exception, for that is not the fact. See under Periphrasis.

Joh. 17:21.-“That the world may believe”: i.e., many in the world,

without distinction.

1Co. 11:32.-“That we should not be condemned with the world”: i.e.,

with the ungodly.

1Jn. 3:1.-“Therefore the world (i.e., those who are without God)
knoweth us not.” 1Jn. 4:5; 1Jn. 5:4-5, etc.
So the Devil is the Prince (or god) of this world: i.e., the ungodly
inhabitants of it.
Joh. 12:31; Joh. 14:30; Joh. 16:11. 2Co. 4:4. Eph. 2:2; Eph. 6:12.
And conversely, the world may be put for God’s people.
10. Ships are put for the souls in them
Isa. 23:1.-“Howl, ye ships of Tarshish.” Here “ships” are put for the
people in them. So verse 14.
11. Nests are put for the birds in them
Deu. 32:11.-“As an eagle stirreth up her (Heb., masc.) nest”: i.e., her
young in the nest, as is clear from the rest of the verse.
12. Ophir is put for the gold of Ophir
Job. 22:24.-“Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust; and Ophir (i.e., the
gold of Ophir) as the stones of the brooks.”
13. Cup is put for the wine in it

Jer. 49:12.-“Сир” is put for the contents: i.e., for the wine in it.
Eze. 23:32.-“Cup” is put for what is in it.
Luk. 22:17; Luk. 22:20.-“Сир” is put for its contents, as is clear from
verse 20, and Mar. 14:24 and Mat. 26:28.
1Co. 10:16; 1Co. 10:21; 1Co. 11:25-28.-In these and other places
“cup” is put for the contents of it.

14. Region is put for its inhabitants
Gen. 47:15.-“All Egypt came unto Joseph”: /-e., all the Egyptians, as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.]
Psa. 105:38.-“Egypt was glad when they departed”: {6., the Egyptians
were glad.
Psa. 68:31 (32).-“Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God”:
ie., the Ethiopians.
Job. 1:15.-“Sheba fell upon them”: i.e., the Sabeans, as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
See 6:19 and Isa. 43:3.
Mat. 3:5.-“Then went out to him Jerusalem (i.e., the inhabitants of
Jerusalem) and all Judzea (i.e., the dwellers in Judaea),” etc.
Rom. 15:26.-“For it pleased Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain
contribution”: i.e., the saints in Macedones and Achaia.
15. Grave is put for the dead buried in it

Isa. 38:18.-“The grave (i.e., those who are buried in it) cannot praise
thee.” This is clear from verse 19 and Psa. 115:17.

16. Tents, etc., are put for the dwellers therein
Gen. 13:5.-“Tents” are put for the many servants, etc., who dwelt in
them.
Psa. 78:67.-“He refused the tabernacle (or tent: /е., the tribe) of
Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.”
Psa. 87:2.-“The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the
dwellings (i.e., tribes) of Jacob.”
Psa. 91:10.-“Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling”: i.e.,
those who dwell in it.
Pro. 14:11.-Here “house” and “tabernacle” are put for those who dwell
in them.

17. The land or earth are put for its inhabitants
Gen. 6:11.-“The earth also was corrupt before God”: i.e., the
inhabitants of the earth, as is clear from the next verse.
Gen. 11:1.-“And the whole earth was of one language, and of one
speech”: i.e., the people on the earth.
Gen. 18:25.-“Shall not the Judge of all the earth ({6., the people on
the earth) do right?”
Gen. 41:30.-“The famine shall consume the land”: i.e., the people in
the land.
Gen. 41:57.-“And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy”: {6.,
people from all countries.
Jdg. 5:7.-“The villages ceased”: {6., the inhabitants of the villages, or
the Peasantry. So also 5:11. See under Ellipsis and
Homeeopropheron.
1Sa. 14:29.-“Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land”:
ie., the People.
2Sa. 15:23.-“And all the country (i.e., the people) wept with a loud
voice.”
Pro. 28:2.-“For the trangression of a land (i.e., of the people of a
country) many are the princes thereof.”
Psa. 9:8 (9).-“And he shall judge the world in righteousness”: i.e., the
inhabitants of the world.
Psa. 22:27 (28).-“All the ends of the world (i.e., the people living in the
uttermost parts of the world) shall remember and turn unto the Lord.”
So Psa. 67:7 (8).
Psa. 66:1.-“Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands”: i.e., уе
nations.
Psa. 66:4.-“All the earth (i.e., the peoples) shall worship thee.” So
Psa. 82:8; Psa. 96:1. Eze. 14:13.
Mat. 5:13.-“Ye are the salt of the earth”: i.e., the peoples.

“Salt” also is used by Metaphor (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.] ) for its
preserving effects.
Land is also put for its spoils.

Isa. 43:3.-“Egypt’ is put for the spoils of Egypt.

18. Theatre is put for its spectacle
1Со. 4:9.-“For we are made a theatre to the world”: i.e., a spectacle,
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.]

19. City, etc., put for its inhabitants
1Sa. 22:19.-“And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he”: i.e., its
inhabitants.
Jer. 4:29.-“The whole city shall flee”: i.e., all the inhabitants of the city.
Isa. 14:31.-“Cry, О city”: i.e., ye inhabitants of the city.
Jer. 26:2.-“Speak unto all the cities of Judah”: ie, to their
representatives.
Jer. 48:8.-“Here “city,” valley,” and “plain” are put for their respective
inhabitants.

Jer. 49:23.-“Hamath” is put for its inhabitants. So Arpad too in verse
24, Damascus.

Mic. 6:9.-“The Lord’s voice crieth unto the city”: {6., to the inhabitants.
Mat. 11:21; Mat. 11:23.-“Chorazin,” “Bethsaida,” and “Capernaum,”
are put for their inhabitants.
Mat. 23:37.-“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem”: i.e., the people that dwelt
there.
Mar. 1:5.-“Judzea’” is put for its inhabitants.
Mar. 1:33.-“And all the city was gathered”: i.e., all its inhabitants.
Act. 8:25.-They “preached the gospel to many villages of the
Samaritans”: /е., to their inhabitants. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] evades and hides
the Metonymy by rendering it “in many,” etc.

20. Heaven is put for God, Who dwells there
Psa. 73:9.-“They set their mouth against the heavens”: i.e., against
God, Who dwells there.

The rest of the verse confirms this:-“Their tongue (Met. for words)
walketh through the earth.” Here “earth” is put for the people who
dwell upon it; and so “heaven” is put for Him who dwells there.

So Dan. 4:26; Dan. 4:29. 2Ch. 32:20.
Mat. 3:2.-“The kingdom of heaven”: i.e., of God; the sphere in which
God rules and reigns. For the word βασιλεία means dominion rather
than territory.

The expression occurs only in Matthew, and in this gospel we have
it 35 times. Whether the Lord spoke in Hebrew or Aramaic is open to
question: but it is certain He did not speak in Greek.

It is also certain that several passages, which are exactly parallel
in every other respect, are unlike in this: e.g., Mat. 11:11 : “He that is
least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he (i.e., John the
Baptist),” and Luk. 7:28 : “He that is least in the kingdom of God is
greater than he.”

How is this difference to be explained? Only by the assumption
that the Lord speaking in Aramaic, or Hebrew, used the words
“kingdom of heaven.” Then, in putting this into Greek, in Matthew the
figure was preserved, literally; while in Luke it was translated,
“kingdom of God.”

“Heaven” is frequently put for “God,” who dwells there. We say”
Heaven forbid,” “Heaven protect us,” etc. So the lost son says, “I have
sinned against heaven.” He means, against God!
This does not at all affect the truths concerning the kingdom, as
contrasted with the Church.

While the kingdom or reign is God's, yet it has different aspects. In
Matthew, the expression “Kingdom of heaven” corresponds with the
aspect of the kingdom as presented in that Gospel.

Our suggestion is that in each case the words “kingdom of
heaven” were the words spoken in Aramaic; but that, in presenting
them in Greek, the figure is translated, and given idiomatically in Mark
and Luke.

The effect of this figure, then, here, is that, by the figure of
Enallage, the emphasis is placed on the words “heaven” and “God,”
and not on the word “kingdom”; and by the figure of Heterosis, the
plural, “heavens” (as it is in the Greek) is put for the singular to still
more emphasize the expression.

Hence the phrase means that this reign is the Divine or Heavenly
Dominion, in contrast with all the kingdoms which are of or from this
world.

In Matthew, the aspect of it is Old Testament and Jewish; while in
the other gospels the aspect is larger and wider in its sphere.
The reign and rule of God Comprises all in time and space, and
many are the spheres and departments embraced within it. Thus,
while the Church of God is embraced in it, the church is not the
kingdom. While Israel is embraced in it, Israel does not exhaust the
reign and dominion of God. While the Gentiles come within the reach
of that dominion, they are neither the kingdom itself nor the church. All
these are distinct from each other; and yet all are embraced in the
universal reign of heaven; the church occupying its own unique
position as the Body of Christ, in whom all things are to be headed-up
(Eph. 1:10; Eph. 1:20-23).

Mat. 21:25.-“The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven (i.e.,
from God), or of men?” So Luk. 20:4.
Luk. 15:18.-“Father, | have sinned against heaven (i.e., against God),
and before thee.”
Joh. 3:27.-“A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from
heaven”: i.e., from God (who dwells there).

21. Heart is put for nature and character
Psa. 24:4.-“He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.”
Here “hands” are put for the works done by them; while “heart” is
not the muscular organ of the body, but is put for the inward character
Psa. 84:2 (3).-“My soul longeth (i.e., | long), yea, even fainteth for the
courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God”:
ie., my soul and my body, my whole being. See also under
Synecdoche.
1Pe. 3:4.-“Let it be the hidden man of the heart”: i.e., the new nature
implanted within.

22. Belly is put for heart or thoughts
Job. 15:35.-” Their belly prepareth deceit’: i.e., their thoughts and
desires.
Pro. 18:8.-“The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go
down into the chambers of the belly”: i.e., the innermost thoughts and
feelings, moving them as the belly is actually moved by excitement.
See Hab. 3:16. So Pro. 26:22.
Pro. 20:27.-“The spirit of man is the candle (or lamp: /.е., light) of the
Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly”: i.e., moving and
influencing the thoughts and feelings, as the belly itself is moved.
Joh. 7:38.-“He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of
his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” Here, “belly” is put for the
innermost thoughts and feelings, and what the Scripture hath said of
this is written in Pro. 18:4.

iii. The possessor is put for the thing possessed

1. Nations are put for countries

Deu. 9:1.-“To possess nations”: /.е., their countries, and all that they
contained.
2Sa. 8:2.-“And he smote Moab, and measured them (i.e., the territory
of the Moabites) with a line, casting them (i.e., the cities within it) to
the ground.”
Psa. 79:7.-“They have devoured Jacob”: i.e., the riches and good
things of the descendents of Jacob.
Mar. 5:35.-“While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
synagogue”: i.e., from his house: ᾖθ., his servants, whom he
employed.
2. Person is put for possessions

Gen. 15:3.-“And, lo, one born in my house inherits me”: i.e., my
possessions or property.
2Co. 11:20.-“For ye suffer ... if a man devour you”: i.e., your goods or
property, as expressed in Psa. 14:4.

3. Princes are put for the thousands whom they led
Mat. 2:6.-“Art not the least among the princes of Judah.” Here the
princes who led-men by the thousand are put for the thousands or
families whom they led. See 1Sa. 10:19.

In Mic. 5:2 (1), we have the word “thousands” literally instead of
the figure Metonymy. So Jdg. 6:15, and 1Sa. 10:19. Our English
“hundreds,” as applied to a territorial division, has the same origin.

4. God is put for the sacrifices offered to Him
Jos. 13:33.-“The Lord God of Israel was their (the Levites’)
inheritance, as he said unto them”: see verse 14. From which it is
clear that the name of Jehovah is put for the sacrifices which were
offered to him, and which He accepted: {.6., their priesthood, as stated
in 18:7. Deu. 10:9. Eze. 44:28. Num. 18:8; Num. 18:20. Deu. 18:1-3.
5. Christ is put for His people

Act. 9:4.-“Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” i.e., My People who
belong to Me. See verse 5; and compare verses 1 and 2.
1Со. 12:12.-“For as the body is one, and hath many members and all
the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is
Christ” or the Christ: i.e., Christ mystical; not personal; as is clear from
verse 13 and what follows.
Col. 1:24.-“Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh”: i.e., Christ
mystical; not personal; as is clear from what follows: “for His body’s
sake, which is the Church.”

6. God is put for the power manifested by Him
Luk. 1:35.-“The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee”: i.e., the
Highest shall overshadow thee; and His power, which is infinite, shall
be put forth upon or manifested in thee.

iv. The object is put for that which pertains or relates to it

1. Jesus is put for His doctrine
2Co. 11:4.-“For if he that cometh (i.e., the one who is coming, perhaps
from Jerusalem or the Twelve) preacheth another Jesus”: ᾖθ., a
different doctrine or teaching concerning Jesus. See Gal. 1:8.

2. A god is put for his worship
Exo. 32:1.-“Make us a god which shall go before us”: i.e., whom we-
may worship and honour. Compare 1К!. 12:28.

3. Attributes are put for the praise and celebration of them
Psa. 29:1.-“Give unto the Lord glory and strength”: How can we give
these to God? We can praise Him for these, but we cannot give them.
They are thus put, by Metonymy, for the praise given to Him for his
glory and strength. So also Psa. 96:7.

Psa. 8:2 (3).-“Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou

ordained strength”: i.e., praise for the manifestation and putting forth

of God's strength, as is clear from Mat. 21:16, where it is rendered

“Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise.”
4. Burden is put for the prophecy

Isa. 21:1.-“The burden of the desert of the sea.” Here, “burden” is put

for the prophecy of Divine punishment which follows. So Isa. 13:1; Isa.

23:1, etc., etc. Mal. 1:1 The burden might be in words, or by a vision.
5. Sin is put for the offering for sin

Gen. 4:7.-“Sin (i.e., a sin offering) lieth at the door.” So the word “sin”

is frequently used for a sin offering. See Exo. 30:10. Lev. 4:3; Lev.

6:25. Num. 8:8. Psa. 40:6 (7), etc. Lev. 7:5; Lev. 7:7. 1Sa. 6:3-4, and

2Co. 5:21.

Exo. 29:14.-‘It is a sin”: i.e., an offering which atones for sin.

Hos. 4:8.-“They eat up the sin, ({.6., the sin-offering) of my people.”
2Со. 5:21.-“Не hath made him to be sin (i.e., a sin-offering) for us.”
See- Isa. 53:10. Eph. 5:2.

6. Promise is put for the faith which receives it
Rom. 9:8.-“The children of the promise are counted for the seed”: i.e.,
who believe and receive the promise of God, as is clear from 4:12, 16.
Gal. 3:7; Gal. 3:29; Gal. 4:28.

7. Covenant is put for the two tables of stone
1Ki. 8:21.-“l have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
covenant of the Lord (i.e, the two tables of stone) which he made with
our fathers,” etc., as is clear from Exo. 34:28 Rom. 9:4. See especially
Deu. 9:9; Deu. 9:11; Deu. 9:15; Deu. 9:17.

8. Blood is put for blood-shedding
Isa. 33:15.-“That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood”: from
listening to those who shed blood, according to Pro. 1:10-11.
9. Double is used for that which is complete, thorough, or ample;
and of full compensation, whether of judgment or of blessing

This Metonymy arose out of the literal use of the word. See
Gen. 43:12, where the “double money” was to pay for the corn taken
that time as well as for that which was taken the time before.
Exo. 16:5.-The “double” manna was “twice as much,” so as to be
enough for two days instead of one.
Exo. 22:7; Exo. 22:9, where the thief was to restore “double”: i.e., to
make compensation in full.
Deu. 15:18, where the liberated bond-servant was worth the “double”
of an hireling in serving six years instead of three (compare Isa. 16:14;
Isa. 21:16).

From this literal use of the words mishneh (ida) and kiphlayim
(6666), the word “double” is used by Metonymy, as follows:-
Job. 11:6.-“The secrets of wisdom are double to that which is”: /.e., far
beyond, or much more.

Job. 41:13.-“Who can come to him (leviathan) with his double ({6.,
strong) bridle.” Here. it is 666 (kephel) in the singular.

Isa. 40:2.-“For she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for all her
sins”: i.e., full punishment.

Isa. 61:7.-“For your shame ye shall have double, and for confusion
they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore, in their land they shall
possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.”

Here, we have the “double” denoting not full punishment (as in Isa.
40:2), but complete compensation. And this is marked in the
alternation of the four lines: where we have this completeness in the
first and third lines; and the consequent joy and rejoicing in the
second, and fourth lines:-

a For your shame ye shall have complete compensation or full

acquittal.
Ь And for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion.

a Therefore in their land they shall possess the complete

pardon.
Ь — Everlasting joy shall be unto them.
Jer. 17:18.-“Destroy them with double destruction”: ie., with a
complete destruction.
Jer. 16:18.-“And first | will recompense their iniquity and their sin
double”: i.e., with a complete and thorough punishment. Not literally
double, but completely.
Zec. 9:12.-“Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-
day do | declare that | will render double unto thee”: ie., | will
completely pardon you and give you full compensation for all your
troubles.
1Ti. 5:17.-“Let the elders that rule be counted worthy of double ({6.,
liberal) honour (/.е., maintenance).” See under /diom.

v. The thing signified is put for the sign

Exo. 8:23 (19).-“And | will put a redemption between my people and
thy people ({6., the judgment, which would be the sign of the
redemption): for to-morrow will this sign be.”
Num. 6:7.-“Because the consecration (Heb. separation, see margin)
of his God is upon his head”: {6., the hair, which was the sign and
symbol of his separation.

Deu. 16:3.-“Unleavened bread ... even the bread of affliction”: i.e., the
bread which was the sign and symbol of their affliction in Egypt.

Deu. 22:15; Deu. 22:17.-Here the Metonymy is supplied in italics, the
letter of the passage being so obviously figurative.

2Ki. 13:17.-“The arrow of the Lord’s deliverance”: i.e., the sign of the
future deliverance which the Lord would work for His People.

1Ch. 16:11.-“Seek the Lord and his strength”: i.e., the Ark of the
Covenant, which was the sign and symbol of His Presence and
strength. So Psa. 105:4, according to Psa. 132:8.
Psa. 78:6.-“And delivered his strength into captivity” i.e., the Ark of the
Covenant, referring to 1Sa. 4:11, etc. See Psa. 132:8.

Isa. 49:6.-“It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise
up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the desolations of Israel”: i.e., the
land and the cities of Israel which have been reduced to desolation.

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] renders it “preserved,” not seeing the figure, but
it puts “desolations” in the margin.

Eze. 7:27.-“The prince shall be clothed with desolation”: i.e., with his
garments rent, which was the sign of his mourning.

IV. Metonymy of the Adjunct
The fourth division of Metonymy is called the Metonymy of the Adjunct
(or Relation), and is the opposite of Metonymy of the Subject.

It is so called because some circumstance pertaining to the
subject is put for the subject itself; e.g., the contents for the container,
the possession for the possessor, etc. It is divided into the seven
following parts:-
i. The adjunct or accident is put for the subject

That which is an accident, or belongs to anything, is put for the subject
or the thing itself to which it belongs.

1. The abstract is put for the concrete; or, the attribute is put for

that to which anything is attributed

Gen. 31:54.-“Then Jacob killed beasts upon the mount”: i.e., he
offered sacrifices, as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it. Here, by
Metonymy, the abstract is put for its concrete.
Gen. 42:38.-“Then shall ye bring down my grey hairs (i.e., me, in my
old age) with sorrow to the grave.”
Gen. 46:34.-“For every shepherd is an abomination (ie., an
abominable person) unto the Egyptians.”

1Sa. 15:29.-“And also the eternity of Israel will not lie nor repent.”
Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] renders it “Strength,” but the attribute “Eternity”
is put for Him to whom it is attributed: i.e., the eternal One: i.e., God.
See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin.

2Sa. 23:23.-“And David set him over his listeners”: i.e., those who
stood at David’s door and listened for his command. Hence his
bodyguard. See 20:23. 1Ki. 1:38.

Neh. 5:9.-“Because of the reproach (i.e., the reproachful deeds) of the
heathen our enemies.”

Job. 5:16.-“So the poor hath hope, and iniquity (i.e., the iniquitous
man) stoppeth his mouth.”

Job. 31:21.-“If | have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when |
saw my help ({6., those who helped me or would be on my side) in the
gate.”

Job. 32:7.-“I said, Days (i.e., men of days, or men of full age) should
speak, and multitude of years (i.e., aged men) should teach wisdom.”
Psa. 12:1 (2).-“Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth: for the faithful
from the sons of men fail”: i.e., faithful men fail. So Psa. 31:23 (24).
2598. 20:19.

Psa. 65:8 (9).-“They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at
thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
rejoice”: [.Θ., thou makest those who go out in the morning and return
in the evening to sing. [Note: ing. The Singular Number.] See under
Ellipsis.

Psa. 68:18 (19).-“Thou hast led captivity ({6., captives) captive.” Isa.
49:24. Jer. 29:14.

Psa. 110:3.-“From the womb of the morning: thou hast (or shall be)
the dew of thy youth”: i.e., thy young men shall be born to thee as dew
is born in the morning.
Pro. 23:21.-“For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:

and drowsiness (i.e., the sluggard) shall clothe a man (i.e., himself)

with rags.”

Isa. 57:13.-“Vanity (i.e., vain men) shall take them.” So Psa. 144:4.

Jam. 4:14.

Jer. 2:5.-They “have walked after vanity (i.e., vain things, or idols),

and are become vain.” See under Paronomasia. So Deu. 32:21. Jer.

14:22, and compare Act. 14:15.

Eze. 44:6.-“And thou shalt say unto rebellion”: i.e., to the rebellious

People.

Amo. 8:3.-“And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day.”
Here, through missing the Metonymy in the first part of this

sentence, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of

our English Bible, 1611.] has been obliged to alter the latter part, and

put in the margin, “Heb., shall howl.” But if we note that “songs” are

put for singers, then we have perfect sense:-“And the singers of the

temple shall howl in that day.”

Luk. 1:78.-“Whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us”: i.e.,

the morning star which precedes the day. So John the Baptist, as the

“morning star,” preceded Christ, Who is “the Sun of Righteousness.”
See Isa. 9:2 (1); 60:1, 2. Mal. 4:2 (3:20), etc.

Joh. 11:40.-“Said | not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou
shouldest see the glory (i.e., the glorious work) of God?”

Rom. 3:30.-“Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision
by faith and uncircumcision through faith.” Here, “circumcision” is put
for those who are circumcised; and uncircumcision for uncircumcised
persons, as in 15:8 and Gal. 2:9; Gal. 2:12.

Rom. 8:19.-“The earnest expectation of the creation ({6., created
things or creatures) waiteth.”

Rom. 11:7.-“But the election (i.e., elect persons) hath obtained it.”
Eph. 1:21.-Here, the attributes are put for the beings who possess
them:-“Far above all princes, and powerful beings, and mighty ones,
and lords”: i.e., all spiritual beings in heavenly places. See also under
Synonymia and Polysyndeton.

Php. 1:16.-“Supposing to add affliction to my bonds”: i.e., my captivity.
See also under Prosapodosis.

1Pe. 2:17.-“Love the brotherhood”: i.e., the brethren. Compare 1Ре.
5:9.
2. Other adjuncts also are put for the subjects to which they
pertain: as Light for the sun, Oil for anointing, etc.

Gen. 34:29.-“And all their strength”: i.e., wealth, as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
Exo. 14:4.-“And | will be honoured upon Pharaoh and upon all his
power.” Heb. is geél: ie., his power, which is put by Metonymy for
his army, which was the expression of his power. See below 1Sa.
14:48.
Lev. 13:4.-“Then the priest shall shut up the plague seven days”: i.e.,
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “him that hath the plague.” See verses 13, 31, 50.
Deu. 8:17.-“And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of
mine hand hath gotten me this strength”: i.e., wealth, as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
1Sa. 14:48.-“And he gathered a power” (Heb. geé, i.e., an host), as
in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] See Exo. 14:4.
1Ki. 7:9.-“From the foundation unto the coping.” Heb. édgiu
(tephachoth), spans, put by Metonymy for the height: i.e., from the
foundation to the summit.

Job. 6:22.-“Give a reward (or perhaps “bribe”) for me of your
strength”: i.e., “of your substance,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ; 19., that which
your strength has procured.
Job. 31:26.-“If | beheld the light when it shined.”

Here “the light” is put for the sun, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] (see margin). So
also 37:21 and Hab. 3:4.

Pro. 5:10.-“Lest strangers be filled with thy strength”: i.e., thy wealth,
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.]

Pro. 15:6.-“In the house of the righteous is much strength”: ie.,
treasure, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.]

Isa. 1:18.-“Though your sins be as scarlet.” It is a question whether
here “sins” be not put for sinners. Certainly persons are spoken of,
and it is not easy to think of “sins,” as such, becoming white! It is the
sinner himself who is thus made “whiter than snow.” Psa. 51:7.

Isa. 10:14.-“And my hand hath found (or found means to reach) as a
nest the strength of the peoples”: i.e., their riches, gotten by their
strength, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.]

Isa. 10:27.-“Because of the oil”: i.e., the anointing, as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
But, from the reference to Gideon’s exploits which we have in verse
26, the sense may be: “And yoke snapt at sight of oil”: i.e., as Midian’s
yoke was distended till it «περί before the ой (or resin) burning in
Gideon’s lamps, so will Asshur’s yoke, again, recoil (enlF, verse 26)
from thy neck, before the hot “blast” (see 37:7, and compare Psa.
18:15 (16); see, too, 2Th. 2:8).

Isa. 30:6.-“They will carry their strength ({6., riches) upon the
shoulders of young asses.” Here “strength” is put for the riches and
presents which Israel’s ambassadors were taking down to Egypt, to
induce Egypt to help Israel against Assyria. In verses 2 and 3,
“strength” is used literally. But in the next verse (7), it is put by
Metonymy for “Egypt,” in whose strength they trusted.

Isa. 30:7.-“Their strength is to sit still.”

These words are usually taken as an exhortation to the Lord’s
people to sit still and do nothing. But the fact is just the opposite. They
are spoken of Egypt, on whom Israel was relying for help against the
Assyrians. See verses 1, 3: “The strength of Pharaoh” was what they
trusted in. But Jehovah declared that that would be a vain trust, for

“The Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:

Therefore have | cried concerning this,
Their strength is to sit still:”
ie., Egypt, when Israel’s ambassadors arrived there (verses 4-6),
would sit still, and not help them at all. “Strength” is put by Metonymy
for Egypt, in the strength of which Israel trusted.
Jer. 20:5.-“Moreover | will deliver all the strength ({6., all the riches
which are procured by strength) of this city ... into the hand of their
enemies.”
Jer. 40:7.-“And of the poverty of the Land”: i.e., the poor people of the
country.
Eze. 38:4.-“And all thy power”: /.e., “all thine army,” as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
Mat. 8:3.-“His leprosy was cleansed”: i.e., the leper. See verses 2, 3,
and compare Mar. 1:42.
Mar. 14:54.-And Peter “warmed himself at the light”: i.e., at the fire, as
in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] See Joh. 18:18.
Act. 14:15.-“We ... preach unto you that ye should turn from these
vanities (i.e., idols) unto the living God.”
Note that the term “Living God” is generally used when idols are
mentioned or implied in the context (See 1Th. 1:9-10, etc.).
Gal. 3:13.-“Being made a curse for us”: i.e., accursed, one under the

curse of the Law.

Eph. 5:8.-“For ye were sometimes darkness ({6., dark and ignorant),

but now are ye light (i.e., enlightened ones) in the Lord.”

ii. The CONTENTS, for that which contains them: and what is

placed, for the place where it is located

Gen. 28:22.-“And this stone, which | have set for a pillar, shall be

God’s house”: {6., this place, of which the stone formed a part.

Jos. 15:19.-“Give me also springs of water”: i.e., land containing them

as well as the south land.

1Ch. 9:24.-“In four winds were the porters”: i.e., in the four quarters,

as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English

Bible, 1611.] But see Jer. 49:32 below.

Psa. 135:7.-“Bringing the wind out of His treasures”: i.e., treasuries,

as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] here properly renders the figure.

Isa. 23:3.-“The harvest of the river”: {6., the country through which the

river flows.
Jer. 49:32.-‘I will scatter into all winds”: i.e., all quarters (Heb., every
wind).

Eze. 5:12.-“I will scatter a third part into all the winds”: i.e., into all
quarters.

Eze. 26:5.-“It shall be the spreading of nets”: /е., a place for the
spreading of nets, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

Hos. 9:6.-“Thorns shall be in their tabernacles”: {6., in the places
where their tents were formerly pitched.

Amo. 8:5.-“Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may
sell corn? and the sabbath that we may open wheat (i.e., granaries).”
Not “set forth wheat,” as in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] The translators have
stumbled over the verb (see margin) through not seeing the Metonymy
of the noun.

Mat. 2:11.-“And when they had opened their treasures”: i.e., their
treasuries or caskets containing them; good and precious presents.
So Psa. 135:7. Mat. 12:35, etc.

Mat. 12:35.-“A good man out of the good treasure”: {6., treasury. The
words “of the heart” go out of the Text with the Textual Critics and R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

Mat. 13:52.-“Which bringeth forth out of his treasure ({6., treasury)
things new and old.”

Mat. 24:31.-“They shall gather his elect from the four winds”: i.e., from
the four quarters of the earth. The elect Nation of Israel is referred to.
Mat. 25:10.-“They that were ready went in with him to the marriage”:
i.e., to the place where the marriage was to be celebrated.

Mat. 25:21; Mat. 25:23.-“Enter thou into the joy of the lord”: {6., into
the place where the lord manifested his joy.

Luk. 21:4.-“All these have of their abundance cast in unto the
offerings of God”: i.e., into the chest or receptacle which received
those offerings made to God. Compare Mat. 15:5; Mat. 27:6.

Act. 16:13.-“Where we supposed was prayer”: {6., a place of prayer.
See verse 16. The word rendered “supposed” means that they looked
for and expected to find a place of prayer as lawfully and legally
allowed. Compare Luk. 3:23.

1Co. 9:24.-“Know ye not that they which run in a race-course (or
stadium)”: i.e., a race which is run there.

Gal. 2:12.-“For before that certain came from James”: i.e., from
Jerusalem, where James presided. See Act. 12:17; Act. 21:18.
Heb. 12:1.-“Let us run the race-course (or stadium)”: i.e., the race
which is run there. So 1Co. 9:24.
Rev. 8:3.-“And another angel came, having golden frankincense”: i.e.,
а censer. See verse 5.

iii. TIME is put for the things done in it, or existing in it
1. The word Time or Times
1Ch. 12:32 (33).-“And of the children of Issachar, which were men that
had understanding of the times”: {6., who understood what was going
on and being done, and needful to be done.
Est. 1:13.-“Then the king said to the wise men which knew the times”:
i.e., what was best to be done in connection with present and future

prosperity shall be brighter and clearer than noon.

be done to me) are in thy hand.” All are known to Thee, according to
Psa. 139:1.
2Ti. 3:1.-“This know also that in the last days difficult times will come”:
ie., difficult things will be done: which things are described in verses
2-5.

2. Age (αἰών, αἰφη), a period of time, is put for what takes place
in it

Mat. 13:22.-“The cares of this world”: lit., “of this age”: i.e., the things
of this life. So Mar. 4:19.
Luk. 16:8.-“The children of this world ({.6., of this age)”: those who are
living for the present things of this world.
Rom. 12:2.-“Be not conformed to this age”: i.e., to the passing
fashions, practices, and maxims of this world.

when that rule will be done away.

See under Anaphora and Antimereia.

age”: i.e., the course and life of this world.
Heb. 1:2.-“By whom also he made (or constituted) the ages”: i.e., the

καταρτίζω (katartizq), to adjust, prepare, or restore.
3. Years is put for what happens in them
Pro. 5:9.-“Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years (i.e.,
thy strength and labours and life) unto the cruel.”
4. Day, or Days, is put for what transpires in them, the context
showing what it is
Deu. 4:32.-“For ask now of the days that are past”: /е., of what has
been done in them, past history.
Job. 18:20.-“They that come after him shall be astonied at his day”:
{9., at his fate.
Job. 24:1.-“Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do
not they that know him see his days?” i.e., understand His dealings
with them.
Psa. 37:13.-‘The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day
(i.e., his punishment) is coming.”
Psa. 137:7.-“Remember, О Lord, the children of Edom in the day (i.e.,
calamities) of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the

is at hand.” So Joe. 2:1; Joe. 2:31 (Joe. 3:4). Amo. 5:20. Zep. 1:14-16;
Zep. 1:18; Zep. 2:2.

Oba. 1:12.-“Thou shouldest not have looked on the day (i.e., the
calamity) of thy brother.”

Mic. 7:4.-“The day of thy watchmen”: ᾖθ., the calamity which the
watchmen will see coming.
Luk. 17:22; Luk. 17:26.-“The days of the Son of man”: i.e., the day
when Christ, as the second man, the Lord from heaven, shall assume
universal dominion over the earth and execute the judgments
necessary to secure it.
Luk. 19:42.- thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day”:
ie., in this time of grace, and of all the wonderful blessings which have
been brought to thee. See verse 44.
1Co. 4:3.-“It is a very small thing that | should be judged of you, or of
man’s day”:* [Note: See Four Prophetic Periods, by the same author
and publisher. Price one penny.] /.е., by human judgment. For now is
the time when man is judging; but the Lord’s day is coming, when He
will judge.

Psa. 118:27.-“Bind the feast (i.e., sacrifice) with cords.”

Isa. 29:1.-“Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
year to year; let them kill sacrifices.” Here, the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
translates the Metonymy “sacrifices,” for which in the Hebrew is put
“feasts”; lit., “kill the feasts”: {6., the sacrifices.

In Mal. 2:3, where it is so very clear, the A.V. [Note: The

adorn and beautify the earth. The Chaldee has “which is praised in the
earth”; and the Heb.: cir (zahmor) means to adorn. See the first

song in praise of God. But cir does not mean primarily to praise, but
to embellish or adorn or trim the song.

calling”: i.e., of that for which He has called you: viz., to deliver you out
of the tribulation; so that He may be glorified in His saints before He
comes forth “in flaming fire,” etc. (verses 8 and 9). For that coming
forth in judgment will not take place until He shall have come. (ἔλθῃ,
elthee), thus to be glorified: ἔλθῃ is the 2nd Aor. Subj. Compare its use

needy, now will | arise, saith Jehovah; | will set him (1.6., each one) in
safety: he bloweth upon (i.e., he despiseth) it ({6., the oppression).”
