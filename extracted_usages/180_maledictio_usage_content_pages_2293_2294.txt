Maledictio; or, Imprecation
Expression of Feeling by way of Malediction or Execration
Mal’-e-dic’-ti-o. This is the Latin name, and means denunciation,
cursing, imprecation, or execration.

Hence the other Latin names, IMPRECATIO and EXECRATIO,
COMMINATIO. Also ARA, an altar, by which, and at which, oaths and
execrations were pronounced.

The Greeks called it APEUCHE, ap-eu-chee, from ἀπεύχομαι, to
pray a thing away, to pray that a thing may not be, and MISOS, mi-
sos, Greek µῖσος, hate, hatred, a hateful object or thing.

See 1Sa. 3:17. Rth. 1:17.

Eze. 34:2.-“Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
themselves!”

A woe that comes upon all shepherds to-day who do not “feed the
flocks.”

See the whole chapter for the reasons for this solemn “Woe.”

A concordance will enable students to find the examples for
themselves, as they begin with “Woe,” such as those in Deu. 28:11-19.
