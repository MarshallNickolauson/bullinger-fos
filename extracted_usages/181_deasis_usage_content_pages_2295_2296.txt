The Latins called it OBSECRATIO, a beseeching, imploring, and
OBTESTATIO, an adjuring, or calling of God to witness.

The figure is used when the speaker or writer calls God or heaven
to witness to the truth of what is said, or to the facts which he states.
Apart from this calling to witness, the figure is of the nature of
Apostrophe (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).

For examples, see Deu. 4:26; Deu. 30:19. 2Sa. 20:20. Job. 27:5.
Isa. 14:24; Isa. 62:8. Jer. 22:5; Jer. 27:5. Eze. 5:11; Eze. 33:11; Eze.
34:8. Act. 20:26.

It is exemplified in such phrases as: “Be it far from me”; “The Lord
do so unto me,” if | do or do not, etc.; “As the Lord liveth, and as thy
soul (thy own self) liveth.”

“Be it far from me” seems to mean “profane be it to me”: i.e., be it
as far from me as | could wish a profane thing to be.
