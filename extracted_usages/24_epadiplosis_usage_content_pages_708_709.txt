The repetitions at the beginning and end of distinct portions, or
independent passages (such as Psa. 8:1-9, ciii., etc.), belong rather to
the subject-matter and are classed under Correspondence (q.v. [Νοίε:
Which 5εε.]).

Epadiplosis; or, Double Encircling
Repeated Epanadiplosis

When Epanadiplosis occurs at the beginning and end of successive
sentences, it is called EPADIPLOSIS (Ep-a-dip-lo-sis), a doubling
upon.
Psa. 47:6.-

“Sing praises to God, sing praises:

Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.”
Rom. 14:8.-“For whether we live, to the Lord we live; and whether
we die, to the Lord we die.”
Anadiplosis; or, Like Sentence Endings and
Beginnings
The Repetition of the same Word or Words at the end of one
Sentence and at the beginning of another
An‘-a-di-plo-sis. Greek, ἀναδίπλωσις, ava (ana), again, and διπλοῦν
(diploun), to double, or διτλοῦς (diplous), double.

It is also called EPANASTROPHE (Ep -a-nas*-tro-phe), from étri
(epi), upon, ava (ana), again, and στρέφειν (strephein, to turn), and
means, a turning upon again.

Also PALILLOGIA (pa-lil-log’-i-a), from πάλιν (palin), again, and
λόγος (logos), a word.

In Latin it is called REVERSIO, a turning back; and
REDUPLICATIO, a reduplication. The figure is so-called because the
word which ends one sentence is repeated at the beginning of the
next.
