Aganactesis; or, Indignation
An Expression of Feeling by way of Indignation

Ag’-an-ak-tee’-sis. Greek, ἀγανάκτησις, physical pain and irritation;
hence vexation, indignation.

The figure is used when an exclamation proceeds from the deep
feeling of indignation.

See Gen. 3:13; Gen. 4:10; Gen. 20:9; Gen. 31:26.
Act. 13:10.-Here we have a forcible example of Paul’s indignation at
the opposition of Elymas the Sorcerer.
Apodioxis; or, Detestation
An Expression of Feeling by way of Detestation
Ap ‘-o-di-6x’-is. Greek, aTrodiwéic, a chasing away; from ἁπό (apo),
away from, and διώκειν (αἰδκείη), to pursue.

The figure is so called, because the speaker or writer repels
something, and spurns it as absurd or wicked.

The Latins called it REJECTIO, a rejecting or rejection;
DETESTATIO, a detesting or detestation; and ABOMINATIO, an
abominating or abomination.

Psa. 50:16.-“But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
mouth?”

Isa. 1:12-15 is a solemn expression of Jehovah’s detestation of
religion, per se, such as existed among, and was manifested by, the
Jews at Christ's first coming. This passage describes the most minute
attention to every religious observance, which only heightens the
indignation with which the Lord repudiates it all, because it does not
proceed from the heart.
