Gen. 1:2.-“Апа the earth had become tohp1 (Wl) and Бопы (2al).”
For the lesson taught by this (the second Figure used in the Bible),
see under Anadiplosis.
Gen. 4:25.-“She called his name Seth (ad, Sheth). For God, said
she, hath appointed (ad, shsth, set) me a seed instead of Abel,
whom Cain slew.”

Gen. 9:27.-“God shall enlarge (e6u; yapht) Japhet (δ6δή,
Pyephet).”

Gen. 11:9.-"Therefore is the name of it called Babel (AAG, Babel),
because the Lord did there confound (aéé, balal, or turn to babble)
the language of all the earth.”

Gen. 18:27.-Abraham says, “Behold now, | have taken upon me to
speak unto the Lord, which am but dust (hdr, aphar) and ashes
(fOr, v’epher).” See also Job. 30:19.

Gen. 29:34."Now this time will my husband be joined (6618,
yillaveh) ... therefore was his name called Levi (élé, Levi, or
Jjoiner).”

Gen. 29:35.-“Now will | praise (158, фаей) the Lord: therefore she
called his name Judah (ealaa, y’hudah).”

Gen. 41:51.-“And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh
(dua, M’nasheh): For God, said he, hath made me forget (dudé,
nasshanee).”

Gen. 41:52.-“And the name of the second called he Ephraim (réréi,
Ephrayim): for God hath caused me to be fruitful (adrdé,
hiphranee) in the land of my affliction.”

Gen. 49:8.-“Thou Judah (όβΙᾶ8, y’hudah), thy brethren shall praise
thee (élale, yoducha).”

Gen. 49:16~"Dan (Ad, Dan) shall judge (GAC, yadeen) his
People as one of the tribes of Israel.”* [Note: Compare Gen. 30:6 :
“And Rachel said, God hath judged me (addé, dananni) ... therefore
she called his name Dan (ad, Dan).”]

Gen. 49:19.-“Gad (aa, Gad), a troop (aala, g’dbid) shall overcome
him (ealadl; у’яыйеппы); but he shall overcome (όβᾶ, yagud) at
the last.”

Exo. 32:18.-“And he said, /t is not the voice of them that shout
(Adld, апф®) for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry
(Adld, anqpth) for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing
(AGU, annepth) do | hear.”

It may be Englished thus: “It is not the sound of those who strike,
neither the sound of those who are stricken: but the sound of those
who strike up (musically) do | hear.”

Num. 5:18.-“And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water (ié
airéi, mey hammarom) that causeth the curse (aiffréi,
hamarrom).”

Num. 18:2.-“And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi élé, Levee),

Num. 24:21.-“And he looked on the Kenites (a-édé, hakeyno), and
took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou
puttest thy nest (-de, kinnecha) in a rock.”
Deu. 30:3.-And in all the passages where Jehovah says, “I will turn or
bring again (uae, v’shavto) the captivity (ruluald, eth-
sh’vpith) of my people,” there is this use of two similar words. See
2Ch. 28:11. Neh. 8:17. Job. 42:10. Psa. 14:7; Psa. 53:6 (7); 85:1 (2);
126:1, 4. Jer. 30:3; Jer. 30:18; Jer. 31:23; Jer. 32:44; Jer. 33:7; Jer.

16:53; Eze. 29:14; Eze. 39:25. Amo. 9:14. Zep. 2:7; Zep. 3:20.
1Sa. 1:27-28.-“For this child | prayed; and the Lord hath given me my
petition (UfCUC, sh’alstho), which | asked of him (UfeUE,
shpaltee): therefore also | have lent him (aureuéal; hishiltohpt)
to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent (urlé, shabil).”
1Sa. 13:7.-“And some of the Hebrews (inaréi, V’ivrom) went over
(haf ‚ аугы) Jordan.”

N.B.-“Abram the Hebrew” was so called to describe him as the
man who had come from the other side of the Euphrates and had
crossed over into Canaan. They are so called by Saul in this chapter,
verse 3. See also 14:11, 21, where the Philistines call them so.
2Sa. 22:42.-“They looked @eunil; yishbt), but there was none to save
(δή, πιῴσμος). Or, they might crave, but there was none to
save.

See also Psa. 18:41 (42).

From the two similar roots und (shaah), to look, and eur
(yasha), to save.
1К!. 2:36.-“And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth
thence any whither” (fda lfda, aneh veanah), i.e., as in English,
hither and thither. So verse 42; and 2Ki. 5:25 : Gehazi said “Thy
servant went no whither,” /.e., aneh veanah, hither and thither.
1Ch. 22:9.-“For his name shall be Solomon (uéta, Shelcbm¢ph), and
| will give peace (uéii, shaldbm) and quietness unto Israel in his
days.”
2Ch. 28:11; Neh. 8:17. See Deu. 30:3.
Job. 11:12.-“For vain (dala, Navbiv) man would be wise (όδά6,
yillavev), though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.” Or, For man, in
his vanity, will vaunt of sanity; though humanity be born as a wild
ass’s colt.

From the two verbs of like origin.
Job. 42:10.-See Deu. 30:3.
Psa. 14:7 (8).-See Deu. 30:3.
Psa. 18:7.-“The earth shook (άβῆή, “vattigash) and trembled
(arn, vattirash).” Or, The earth shaked and quaked.
Psa. 22:16 (17).-Every important Massorah gives a list of words which
occur twice in different senses. The word éffé (kaaro) is one of
these words, and the two places are Isa. 38:13 and Psa. 22:16. There
can be no doubt also that some Codices read {ΤΙ (Ка-агы) as a rival
reading. Dr. Ginsburg concludes from the Chaldee translation that
both these readings were at one time in the text, and it is not
improbable that one of the words of this pair dropped out.* [Note: See
his Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, pp. 968-972.] If this was the
case then there was originally not only a beautiful completeness as to
the sense, but also a forcible Paronomasia as well.

“They tore (δή, Каагы) like a lion (éfré, kaari) my hands and
my feet.” Or

“Like a lion they tore my hands and my feet.”

This is borne out by the structure of the passage (verses 12-17).t
[Note: See under Ellipsis, pp. 28, 29.]

The reading is shown to require the two words, which thus make
the beautiful Paronomasia:

“Like a lion they tore my hands and feet.”

Exactly as in Isa. 38:13.
Psa. 25:16.-“Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for | am
desolate and afflicted” (Inaé faé, vahno ahno, lit. “afflicted am I”).
Psa. 39:11 (12).-“When thou with rebukes dost correct man (feu,
osh) for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth
(AU, ης)”
Psa. 40:3 (4).-“Many shall see it ffl ‚ yirbt) and fear (léérrl-
у’уогаы).” Or, Many will peer and fear.

See also Psa. 52:6.
Psa. 53:6 (8).-See Deu. 30:3.
Psa. 56:8 (9).-“Thou tellest my wanderings (daé, пфаее); put thou
my tears into thy bottle (AG/AE, b’nodecha).” The similarity of
sound is intended to call our attention to the fact that the tears caused
by our wanderings are noted and noticed by God.
Psa. 64:4 (5).-“Suddenly do they shoot at him (éfal; уогибы) and
fear (eérfl; yorakp)) not.”
Psa. 69:30-31 (31, 32).-“I will praise the name of God with a song
(aber, b’shor).... This also shall please the Lord better than an ox
(iu if, mishgpr) or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.”

Psa. 85:1. See Deu. 30:3.

Psa. 96:5.- ΕΟΓ all the gods (élréae, kol-elohay) of the nations
are idols (reeéeei, elolom).” This latter word means nothings, or
things of naught; so that we might render it, “The gods of the nations
are imaginations.”

Psa. 119:13.-With my lips (AUOUE, bispatai) have | declared
(AOFUE, sipparti).”

Psa. 122:6.-“Pray for (urél; shaalbl) the peace of (uéli, sh’lom)
Jerusalem (efluééi, Y’rbishalayim): they shall prosper (euéel;
yishlahybt) that love thee.”

Psa. 126:1; Psa. 126:4.-See Deu. 30:3.

Psa. 137:5.-‘If | forget thee, О Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning.” This is how the passage stands in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] It has also been treated as
an Ellipsis (see pp. 9, 10); where we have supplied “me” after the
verb, i.e., let my “right hand forget me.”

The first verb is ruéee. (eshkachech), / / forget thee. And the
second is uude (tishkach), /её it forget (third pers. sing. Kal. fut.
from ὑδς, shachach).

Dr. Ginsburg suggests that in the transcription from the ancient
Phoenician characters to the present square Hebrew characters, the
aleph (= is) which originally commenced the latter word, was mistaken
for Tau ( = U), which it closely resembles, and thus the verb was
changed from the first person to the third in the second clause. If we
restore the Aleph i) we have the following sense and a beautiful
Paronomasia:-

“If | forget thee ({ᾷξςρ, eshkachech), Ο Jerusalem, may | forget
(ruée, eshkach) my right hand.”
Pro. 6:23.-“For the commandment is a lamp, and the law (ΜΙΓΑ,
v’teprah) is light (fr, opr); and reproofs of instruction are the way of
life.”
Pro. 18:24.-The Paronomasia here lies in the word “friends,” ἴπέί,
reyim, and éaurinn, lehitrepsa (i.e., геуе and гфза: the “т” of the
former, and “lehith” of the latter belonging to the inflections). The latter
is from ima (raah), to break (and not from mma (raah), to feed), and
means to our own detriment, and not to make friends. Then further,
ru (ish) is not a peculiar spelling of réu (osh), man, but stands for
éu, there is. So that the verse reads:

“There are friends to our own detriment (or ruin);

But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”

Or, as we might put it:
“There are friends that break us,
But there is a friend that makes us.”
Or:-
“There are friends that give us broken hearts,
But there is a friend who ne’er departs.”
Ecc. 7:1.-“A good (cla, 1фу) name (uf, shem) is better than
ointment (uid, mishshemen) that is good (cla, tov).

See under Epanadiplosis.

Ecc. 7:6.-“As the crackling (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] sound) of
thorns (anéréi, hassirim) under the pot (aneéyr, hassir) so is the
laughter of fools.”

Here the figure attracts the attention to the fact that the burning of
the thorns makes a noise, but it lasts only for a moment and it is all
over. So it is with the laughter of fools. See further and compare Psa.
58:9; Psa. 118:12, and Ecc. 2:2.

It may be Englished thus: “As the sound of the nettle under the
kettle;” or, “as the flaming of whin* [Note: Furze or gorse.] neath a
caldron of tin;” or, “as the blazing of grass neath a caldron of brass.”
Isa. 2:19; Isa. 2:21.-“When He ariseth to shake terribly (δΗἴό,
laar¢ptz) the earth (AITO, haaretz).”

Isa. 5:7.-"He looked for judgment (11166, mishpat), but behold
oppression (ide, mishpach); for righteousness (6a-a, tzdakah),
but behold a cry (ОЙ-а, tzeskeh).”

We might English this by rendering it, “He looked for equity, but
behold iniquity; for a righteous nation, but behold lamentation.”
Isa. 7:9.-“If ye will not believe (fi ёг ЦЙёб' im lo taaminbt!),
surely ye shall not be established (6é ёг ufidl; ki lo {еатепы.

We may English it thus:-“If ye will not understand, ye shall not
surely stand.” Or,

“If ye have no belief, surely ye shall have no relief.”

Or, “no confiding, no abiding.”
Isa. 10:16.-“And under his glory he shall kindle (6-a, yekad) a
burning (6 -Ἔ, уекфа) like the burning (G@-I8, кжфа) of a fire.”
Isa. 13:4.~"The Lord of hosts (ОаЙИ, tzevacpth) mustereth the host
(баг, tzeva) of the battle,” or a host for the battle.
Isa. 13:6.-“Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as
a destruction (GUA, k’shtbd) from the Almighty (11186, mish-
shaddai).” The awful nature of that day is emphasized by this figure,
and our attention is directed to the fact that Destruction comes from
the all-bountiful One! It is like “the wrath of the Lamb,” of which we
read in Rev. 6:16-17. We have the same figure again in Joe. 1:15.

Isa. 15:9.-“For the waters of Dimon (AGiIC’, Dimepn) shall be full of
blood (Ai, dam).”

Isa. 17:1.-“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city inéy,
meyeer) and it shall be a ruinous heap (iné, me-o).” The latter word
is put for inlé, ma-avee, so that by an unusual form of the word it
may allude to the word “city.”

Isa. 17:2.-“The cities (Are, araye) of Aroer” (AAR, Aroer).

Isa. 21:2.-“Go up (ἄξό, alee), Ο Elam (ἄόξί, eylam).”

Isa. 22:18.-“He will surely (ald, tzandph) violently turn (e6dée,
yitznaphcha) and toss thee (6d6a, tzenepha).”

Isa. 24:3."The land shall be utterly (AAl- ΠΙΡΟΦΚ) emptied (IAI-,
ΕΒΟΦΚ), and utterly (AIG, whibbepz) spoiled (MAIC, tibbepz): for
the Lord hath spoken this word.”

Isa. 24:4.-“The earth mourneth (Faéa, avelah) and fadeth away
(daéa, naviah), the world (UAE, tevel) languisheth (Пёёа,
umlelah), and fadeth away (daéa, navlah), the haughty people of
the earth do languish (eel; umlalbi).

Isa. 24:17-18.-"Fear (O€A, pachad), and the pit (δού, v’phachat),
and the snare (δς, vapach) are upon thee, Ο, inhabitant of the
earth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
the fear (AO€A, happachad) shall fall into the pit (AOCU,
happachat): and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit (a6eu,
happachat) shall be taken in tone snare (ad¢, bappach).
See also Jer. 48:43-44.
Isa. 25:1.-O Lord, thou art my God: | will exalt thee (ΠΠ,
ardmimcha), | will praise thy name (faa ὑῖθ, cbdeh shimcha).”
Isa. 25:6.-“And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all
people a feast duda, mishteh) of fat things (uidéi, sh’maneem) a
feast (ada, mishteyh) of wines on the lees (uiréi, sh’marim), of
fat things (uidéi, sh’manim) full of marrow (igéi,
m’muchayeem), of wines on the lees (uiréi, sh’marim) well
refined.
Isa. 30:16.-“But ye said, No; for we will flee (din, Nanbis) upon
horses (nih, 5015): therefore shall ye flee (Μα[ήία, ?nbisbin): and,
We will ride upon the swift (-6, kal); therefore shall they that pursue
you be swift (-él- yikkallbt).
Isa. 32:6.-“For the vile person (daé, naval) will speak villainy
(daéa, n’valah),” where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] preserves the figure very
well.

Isa. 32:7.-“The instruments also of the churl (lééé 6éél, vecheleo
kelav) are evil.”

Isa. 32:19.-“When it shall hail (lara, bivarad) coming down on
(AF AU, b’redeth) the forest.”

Isa. 41:5.-“The isles saw it (rfl ‚ гаы), and feared (léérrl ‚ V’yirabl):

Isa. 61:3.-“To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them

the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, What seest thou? And |
said, | see a rod of an almond tree (ἀ-ᾶ, shaked). Then said the Lord
unto me, Thou hast well seen; for | will watch over it (U-A, shoked).
So, A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin.

Our attention is thus called to the fact that the almond tree has to
do With judgment deferred, but finally executed. This is just what we
have in Jeremiah: and hence it is the truth set forth in the opening
chapter.

The times of the Gentiles are passed over to show that their
judgment is deferred tiff that foretold shall have been executed on
Babylon (chap. 25).

Chapters 50 and 51 give us the day of reckoning with Babylon for
the plunder and destruction of the temple. Jer. 50:4-5 tells us when it
shall take place. So again 50:20. If we compare the following
passages, it is clear that all this is yet future. Compare:

Jer. 51:13
with

Rev. 17:1; Rev. 17:15;
Jer. 51:8
with

Rev. 18:2;
Jer. 51:45
with

Rev. 18:4;
Jer. 50:13
with

Rev. 18:19;
Jer. 51:48
with

Rev. 18:20;

Jer. 50:15

with

Rev. 18:22-23;

and we shall see that the judgment is indeed deferred; but, it will

surely come. God will “watch over” it to bring it to pass, and this is

emphasized and marked by the three words:

Shaked-shoked-sheshach.* [Note: See Jer. 25:26; Jer. 51:41.]
For the Figure involved in these three words, see under Znigma.

Jer. 1:17.-Here there are two Paronomasias which are alternated:-

“Be not dismayed (ugu, techath) at their faces (i6déai,
mipnehem),
Lest | confound thee (gue, achitcha) before them
(θά 8[, liphnenem).”
Jer. 6:1.-"Blow ({]-ἤ |-tiken) in Tekoa (at-lihy, the trumpet.”
Jer. 8:13.-1 will surely (Frid, ahsqph) consume them «Πέδί,
asiphem).”
Jer. 10:11.-“The gods that have not made (haal; avadb!) the
heavens and the earth, even they shall perish (6faal; yevadb!) from
the earth, and from under these heavens.”

Thus is the verse emphasized, and our attention called to it. And
when we look at it we find that, unlike the rest of the prophecies of
Jeremiah, this verse is not written in Hebrew but in Chaldee! It is a
message sent to the Gentiles and their gods by the God of Israel; and,
like parts of the book of Daniel which specially relate to the Gentiles,
and their times, it is in the Gentile and not in the Hebrew tongue.

See Dan. 2:4-49; Dan. 3:1-30; Dan. 4:1-37; Dan. 5:1-31; Dan.

(aid, madmen).”
Jer. 48:9.-“Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee (dor, natzo) and
get away (άδ, tetze).” Or, may fly and flee away.

Lam. 2:14.-See Deu. 30:3.

Lam. 3:47.-“Fear (9ρᾶ, pachad) and a snare (δού, vaphachath)

Eze. 24:21.-“I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your
strength, the desire (igia, machmad) of your eyes, and that which

your eyes’ admiration and your soul’s commiseration.
Eze. 25:16.-“Behold | will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines,
and | will cut off ([AGTUC, whichratti) the Cherethims (GFUCI,
k’rethim).”
Eze. 29:14; Eze. 39:25.-See Deu. 30:3.
Dan. 5:26-28.-“This is the interpretation of the thing:

МЕМЕ (if, m’ney): God hath numbered (148, m’nah) thy
kingdom and finished it.

TEKEL (U-€, t’kel’): thou art weighed (U-GUF, t’kolta) in the
balances and art found wanting.

PERES (OFM, p’res): thy kingdom is divided (OFENU, p’rosath)

(a-6, haketz) is come upon my people Israel; | will not again pass by
them any more.”

Le., they are now like the ripe fig, ready to be cut off, or ripe for
judgment.
Amo. 9:14.-See Deu. 30:3.

Jon. 4:6.-“And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come
up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow (68, tzel) over his head, to
deliver (GAOEE, Phatzil) him from his grief.” Or, a shield to shelter
his head.

Mic. 1:10.-"In the house of Aphrah (GNOFA, Paphrah) roll thyself in
the dust (nr, aphar).”

The names of all these places (10-15) are significant and
connected with the prophecy associated with them.

“Declare ye it not at Gath, weep not at Accho”t For so it should
read, uy (bacho) rendered “at all,” being the primitive form of the
word and standing for the later and fuller spelling προ] Accho was
connected with water, being a maritime town, and in the
neighbourhood of inland swamps. Now called Akka (French St. Jean
d’Acre). (Water Town).

“In the house of Aphra (Dust town) roll thyself in the dust.”
“Pass ye away thou inhabitant of Saphir (Fair town) in nakedness
and shame” (Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] and see margin
Α.Ν. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] ).

“The inhabitant of Zaanan (Flock-town) is not come forth” (R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).

(Heritage-town).”

“He shall come unto Adullam (Rest-town) the glory of Israel.”
Nah. 2:10."She is empty (@!-а, b’ukah), and void lial-a,
bimbooquah), and waste (ia6-a, umbullakah).”
Hab. 2:18.-“What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof
hath graven it: the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker
of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb (/@/@i, illimim) idols
«ξέξέ[, elitim).”
Zep. 1:2.-“I will utterly ({Πό, ahsoph) consume ({ήό, aseph) all
things from off the land, saith the Lord.” Lit, {ήό, [NO (asoph,
aseph), to end, | end, i.e., by taking away | will make an end of.
Zep. 2:4.-“For Gaza (nga, Aazzah) shall be forsaken (Aclaa,
aazuvah) ... and Ekron (A-fId’, v’ekrqpn) shall be rooted out (UA,
teaker).
Zep. 2:7; Zep. 3:20.-See Deu. 30:3.
Zec. 9:3.-"And Tyrus (Ol, Tz¢pr) did build herself a strong-hold (OIF,
та фг).”
Zec. 9:5.-“Ashkelon shall see it (uFf, tere) and fear (luérf, v’thira).
Mat. 21:41.-“He will miserably (κακῶς, kakdps) destroy those wicked
(κακούς, kakous) wicked men.”

In the Greek the two words come together, thus: κακοὺς κακῶς
(kakous kakqps).
Mat. 22:3.-“They would not come.” οὐκ ἤθελον ἐλθεῖν (ouk eethelon
elthein). See under Meiosis.
Mat. 24:7.-“There shall be famines (λιµοί, limoi), and pestilences
(λοιμοί, loimoi).” So Luk. 21:11.
Rom. 1:29.-“Fornication (πορνεία, porneia* [Note: This word should
go out according to the Texts of L.T.Tr. WH., and Π.Ν] ), wickedness
(πονηρίᾳ, poneeria) ... full of envy (Φθόνου, phthonou), murder
(φόνου, phonou),” etc.
Rom. 1:31.-“Without understanding (douvétouc, asunetous)
covenant-breakers (ἀσυνθέτους, asunthetous).”
Rom. 9:18.-“Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy.”

1Co. 9:17.-“For if | do this thing willingly (ἑκών, hekdpn), | have (ἔχω,
echqp) a reward.” See under Oxymoron.
2Co. 8:22.-“And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have
oftentimes (πολλάκις, pollakis) proved diligent in many things
(πολλοῖς, pollois).”

In the Greek the words come together, and in a different order:-
πολλοῖς πολλάκις (pollois pollakis).

(panti pantote pasan).
Php. 3:2.-“Beware of the katatomee (κατατοµή): for we are the
peritomee (περιτομή).

Thus are contrasted the false and the true circumcision. True
circumcision is “to worship God in the spirit, to rejoice in Christ Jesus,
and to have no confidence in the flesh” (Php. 3:3). It is “of the heart in
spirit, and not in letter” (Rom. 2:25; Rom. 2:29).

To go back therefore to ordinances, and to this ordinance, after
having been made free in Christ is mutilation, not true circumcision.
The verb κατατέµνειν (katatemnein) is always connected with
mutilation, see Lev. 21:5. 1Ki. 18:28. Isa. 15:2. Hos. 7:14.
1Ti. 1:18.-“War a good warfare,” strateian strateuein.
1Ti. 4:3.-This passage has been referred to under Ellipsis and
Zeugma; but there is a latent Paronomasia in one word that is omitted.
The Greek is κωλυόντων (κφΙειοπίφπ), forbidding. This word
suggests the other word which is omitted, but is obviously to be
υπαθιςίοος:-κελευόντων (keleuontdpn), commanding. There is the
difference of only one letter between the two words. This is not, of
course, a pure paronomasia as only one of the words is expressed.
1Ti. 6:5-6.-Where the word porismos, gain, is connected with
peirasmos, temptation, in verse 9.

Heb. 5:8.-“Though he were a Son yet learned he (ἔμαθεν, emathen)
obedience by the things which he suffered (ἔποθεν, epathen).”

Jam. 5:17.-“With prayer (προσευχῆ, proseuchee) he prayed
(προσηύξατο, proseeuxato)”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “He prayed
earnestly.” See Polyptoton.
