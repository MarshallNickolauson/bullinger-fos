Rom. 8:2-15 is a long Parembole setting forth the further relation
between flesh and spirit: /е., the Old man and the New man, the Old
nature and the New divine and spiritual nature, the TveGya (рпеита),
or πνεῦμα xpioToU (pneuma-Christou) which is given to all who are in
Christ. Consequently the “s” in spirit should be a small “s,” and not a
capital letter, in all these verses: the Holy Spirit Himself not being
mentioned, or referred to, as a Person until verse 16.

dead, if the dead rise not all?” etc. (see under Ellipsis, page 41).

sins,” etc. But see under Ellipsis (page 109).
