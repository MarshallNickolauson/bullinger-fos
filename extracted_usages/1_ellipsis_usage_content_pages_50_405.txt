|. The Omission of Nouns and Pronouns
1. The Omission of the Nominative

Gen. 14:19-20.-Melchizedek said to Abram, “Blessed be the most
high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And he
[18., Abram] gave him tithes of all.”

From the context, as well as from Heb. 7:4, it is clear that it was
Abram who gave the tithes to Melchizedek, and not Melchizedek to
Abram.

Gen. 39:6.-“And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew
not ought he had, save the bread Which he did eat. And Joseph was a
goodly person, and well-favoured.”

Here it is not at all clear which it was of the two who “knew not
ought he had.” If we understand Potiphar, it is difficult to see how he
only knew the bread he ate: or if Joseph, it is difficult to understand
how he knew not ought he had.

If the Ellipsis, however, is rightly supplied, it makes it all clear.

The verse may be rendered, and the Ellipsis supplied as follows:-
“And he [Potiphar] left all that he had in Joseph’s hand: and he
[Potiphar] knew not anything save the bread which he was eating. And
Joseph was beautiful of figure, and beautiful of appearance.”
All difficulty is removed when we remember that “the Egyptians
might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto
the Egyptians” (43:32). Everything, therefore, was committed by
Potiphar to Joseph’s care, except that which pertained to the matter of
food.
2Sa. 3:7.-“And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the
daughter of Aiah, and ... said to Abner, Wherefore, etc.”

Here it is clear from the Sense of the next verse and 2Sa. 21:8 that
“Ishbosheth’ is the word to be supplied, as is done in italics.
2Sa. 23:20.-“He slew two lionlike men of Moab.”

The Massorah points out* [Note: Ginsburg’s Edition, Vol. i., p. 106.]
that the word Ariel occurs three times, in this passage and Isa. 29:1.
In Isa. the word is twice transliterated as a proper name, while in 2Sa.
23:20, margin, it is translated lions of God: the first part of the word
alun (агее) a lion, and the second part AM (ϱ) God. But if we keep
it uniformly and consistently as a proper name we have with the
Ellipsis of the accusative (sons) the following sense: “He slew the two
sons of Ariel of Moab.”
2Sa. 24:1.-“And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against
Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel
and Judah.”

Here the nominative to the verb “moved” is wanting. Someone
moved, and who that was we learn from 1Ch. 21:1, from which it is
clear that the word Satan or the Adversary is to be supplied, as is
done in the margin:-“And again the anger of the Lord was kindled
against Israel, and [the Adversary] moved David against them to say,
Go, number Israel and Judah.”
1Ch. 6:28 (12).-“And the sons of Samuel; the firstborn Vashni (marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] , called also Joel, ver. 33 and 1Sa. 8:2) and
Abiah.”

Here there is an Ellipsis of the name of the firstborn: while the
word θμιρῆ, Vashni, when otherwise pointed (CLUB) means “and
the second”! so that the verse reads,

“And the sons of Samuel; the firstborn [Joe/] and the second
Abiah.” This agrees with the Syriac Version. The R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, and translates
vashni “and the second.”

“Joel” is supplied from ver. 33 (see also 1Sa. 8:2, and the note in
Ginsburg’s edition of the Hebrew Bible).
Psa. 34:17.-“[They] cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out
of all their troubles.”

The immediate subject in ver. 16 is evildoers. But it is not these
who cry. It is the righteous. Hence the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supply the words “the righteous”
in italics. The nominative is omitted, in order that our attention may be
fixed not on their persons or their characters, but upon their cry, and
the Lord’s gracious answer.

The same design is seen in all similar cases.

Psa. 105:40.-“[They] asked, and he brought quails,” i.e., the People
asked. The nominative is supplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] But the R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates it literally “They asked.”
Pro. 22:27.-“If thou hast nothing to pay, why should one [i.e., the
creditor] take away thy bed from under thee?”

Isa. 26:1.-“In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; we
have a strong city; salvation will one [i.e. God] appoint for walls and
bulwarks.”
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] interprets by supplying the nominative. The R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates it literally.
Jer. 51:19.-“He is the former of all things, and /srael is the rod of his
inheritance.”

Here both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] supply the Ellipsis from 10:16. Had it been supplied from the
immediate context, it would have come under the head of Relative
Ellipsis, or that of Repetition.

Eze. 46:12.-“Now when the Prince shall prepare a voluntary offering
or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord, one shall then open him
the gate that looketh toward the East, &c.,” ie., ДЩТШ the gate-
keeper (supplied from the noun ДЩТШ, the gate), which follows,
shall open the gate.

Zec. 7:2.-“When they (Heb. he) had sent unto the house of God,
Sherezer and Regem-melech and their men, to pray before the Lord”
[18., when the people who had returned to Judea had sent].

Mat. 16:22.-“Be it far from Thee, Lord.”

Here the Ellipsis in the Greek is destroyed by the translation. The
Greek reads, “IAcewc¢ σοι, κύριε” (hileds soi, kyrie), which is
untranslatable literally, unless we supply the Ellipsis of the Nominative,
thus: “[God be] merciful to Thee, Lord!” Thus it is in the Septuagint
1Ch. 11:19, where it is rendered “God forbid that | should do this
thing,” but it ought to be, “[Соа] be merciful to me [to keep me from
doing] this thing.”

Act. 13:29.-“And when they had fulfilled all that was written, of him,
they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre,” {6.,
Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus took him down. But it is the act
which we are to think of here rather than the persons who did it.
Hence the Ellipsis.

1Со. 15:25.-“For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
feet,” {6., “he [the Son] must reign, until he [the Son] shall have put all
things under his [the Son’s] feet.” Here the subjection refers to the
period of Christ's personal reign.

This is one of the seven New Testament references to Psa. 110:1,
“Jehovah said unto Adon-Sit thou at my right hand, until | make thine
enemies thy footstool.” The English word “make” occurs 1,111 times in
the Old Testament, as the rendering of 49 Hebrew words. The one so
rendered here is Lb (Sheeth) and means to put, place, set, or
appoint, and is rendered make only 19 times out of 94. Its proper
meaning is put or appoint. (See Gen. 3:15; Gen. 4:25; Gen. 30:40.
Psa. 140:5. Isa. 26:1, &c.)
The word in the N. Т. is τίθηµι (titheemi), and has the same
meaning. It is rendered make only 10 times out of 91, but in these
cases it means to set or appoint (Act. 20:28. Rom. 4:17, &c.). In every
case the verb is in the second aorist subjunctive, and should be
rendered “shall have put.”

Six of the seven references (Mat. 22:44. Mar. 12:36. Luk. 20:42.
Act. 2:34. Heb. 1:13; Heb. 10:13) refer to Christ’s session on the
Father’s throne (not to His reign upon His own, Rev. 3:21). And this
session will continue until such time as the Father shall have placed
Christ's enemies as a footstool for His feet. When that shall have been
done, He will rise up from His seat and come forth into the air for His
people, to receive them to Himself, and take them up to meet Him in
the air so to be ever with the Lord. Then He will come unto the earth
with them, and sit upon the throne of His glory, and reign until He shall
have put all enemies under His feet. The other six passages refer to
Christ's session. This one refers to His reign upon His own throne (not
to His session on His Father’s throne, Rev. 3:21). And this reign will
continue until He (Christ) hath put all His enemies under His feet.
Note, that in the six passages His enemies are placed “as a
footstool for His feet,” and there is not a word about their being under
His feet. In the one passage (1Co. 15:25) there is not a word about
being placed “as a footstool,” but the word “under” His feet is used.
We must distinguish between placing and making, and Christ's
session and His reign. Then all these passages teach the Pre-
Millennial and Pre-Tribulation coming of Christ for His people before
His coming with them.* [Note: See Things to Come for October, 1898.]
1Со. 15:53.-“For this corruptible [body] must put оп incorruption, and
this mortal [body] must put on immortality.”

The noun “body” must also be supplied in the next verse.

Eph. 1:8.-“Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and
prudence.”

It is not “wherein,” but ἧς (hees) which, ie., “[the knowledge] or
grace, which he hath made to abound in us in all wisdom and
prudence.”

Tit. 1:15.-“Unto the pure all things are pure.”

The noun “meats” (i.e., foods) must be supplied as in 1Co. 6:12.

“All [meats] indeed are clean to the clean.” The word “clean” being
used in its ceremonial or Levitical sense, for none can be otherwise
either “pure” or “clean.”

Heb. 11:1.-“Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of
divine service.” Here the word covenant is properly supplied in italics.
2Pe. 3:1.-“This second epistle, beloved, | now write unto you; in both
which | stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance,” i.e., “In both
which [epistles] | stir up,” etc.

1Jn. 5:16.-“If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto
death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, etc.,” i.e., “[God] shall
give him life.” See also Mat. 5:11; Mat. 5:15; Luk. 6:38, where men
must be the word supplied.

2. The Omission of the Object or Accusative, etc., after the verb
2Sa. 6:6.-“And when they came to Nachon’s threshing-floor, Uzzah
put forth his hand to the ark of God.”

Here the omission is supplied. The Ellipsis is used, and the
accusative is omitted, in order to call our attention to the act, rather
than to the manner of it.
1Ch. 16:7.-“Then on that day, David delivered first this psalm to thank
the Lord, etc.”

The Ellipsis might also be supplied thus: “David delivered first [the
following words] to thank the Lord, etc.”

Job. 24:6.-“They reap everyone his corn in the field.”

This hardly makes sense with the context, which describes the
wicked doings of those who know not God.

The question is whether the word Omime (beleel6) translated
“his corn” is to be taken as one word, or whether it is to be read as two
words Omi ме (belee 16) which mean not their own. In this case
there is the Ellipsis of the accusative, which must be supplied. The
whole verse will then read,

“They reap [their corn] in a field not their own:

They glean the vintage of the wicked,”
which carries on the thought of the passage without a break in the
argument.

If we read it as one word, then we must supply the Ellipsis
differently:-“They reap their corn in a field [not their own],” so that it
comes, in sense, to the same thing.

Psa. 21:12 (13).-“When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy
strings.”

Psa. 44:10 (11).-“They which hate us spoil for themselves.”

The word spoil is μισῃ (shahsah), and means to plunder. And it
is clear that the accusative, which is omitted, should be
supplied:-“They which hate us plunder [our goods] for themselves.”
The emphasis being, of course, on the act and the motive in the verb
“plunder,” and “for themselves,” rather than on the goods which they
plunder.
In verse 12 (13), both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or

current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] have supplied the accusative, “thy wealth.”
Psa. 57:2 (3).-“I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth
all things for me.” Here the object is supplied in the words “all things.”
Other translators suggest “His mercy,” “His promises,” “my desires.”
Luther has “my sorrow,” the Hebrew being BOLL! (gamar), to bring to
an end, complete, etc. The Ellipsis is left for emphasis. Nothing is
particularised, so that we may supply everything. The mention of any
one thing necessarily excludes others.

In Psa. 138:8 we have the same verb (though with a different

construction) and the same Ellipsis: but the former is translated “the
Lord will perfect,” and the latter is supplied “that which concerneth
me”: i.e., will consummate all consummations for me.
Psa. 94:10.-“He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct [you
among the heathen)?” This is evidently the completion of the sense.
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] fills up the Ellipsis in the next sentence. This is of a
different character, and comes under another division: “He that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?”
Psa. 103:9.-“Neither will he keep his anger for ever.” So in Nah. 1:2;
Jer. 3:5; Jer. 3:12.

Psa. 137:5.-‘If | forget thee, О Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning.”

Here both versions thus supply the accusative. But surely more is
implied in the Ellipsis than mere skill of workmanship. Surely it means,
“If | forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget me.” Let it forget
to work for me, to feed me and to defend me, if | forget to pray for thee
and to defend thee.

Pro. 24:24.-“He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him
shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him;” i.e., “He that saith to
the wicked [king].” This is clear from the context.

Verses 21-25 read literally. “Fear the Lord, O my son, and the king.
With men that make a difference (Lupa, shanah see Est. 1:7; Est.
3:8), between a king and an ordinary man thou shalt not mingle
thyself. For their calamity (whose? evidently that of two persons, viz.,
that of the king and also of the common man) shall rise suddenly; and
who knoweth the ruin of them both? These matters also belong to the
wise.” To make no difference between man and man belongs to
everyone alike, see Deu. 1:17; but to make no difference between a
man and a king is a matter that pertains only to the wise. “/t is not
good to have respect of persons in judgment. He that saith to the
wicked [king, as well as common man], Thou art righteous; him shall
the people curse, nations shall abhor him; but to them that rebuke him
(i.e., the wicked king) shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come
upon them.”
Here there is accuracy of translation and consistency of
interpretation. There is only one subject in verses 21-25.* [Note: Each
“proverb” or paragraph in the book of Proverbs is occupied with only
one subject, even if it consists of several verses. This may sometimes
throw light on a passage, e.g., Pro. 26:3-5, where verses 4 and 5
follow up the subject of verse 3, not changing the subject but enforcing
it; i.e., “For the horse a whip, for the ass a bridle, and for the fool’s
back a rod.” In other words you cannot reason with a horse or an ass,
neither can you reason with a fool. Then follow two very finely stated
facts, not commands. If you answer him according to his folly, he will
think you are a fool like himself, and if you answer him not according
to his folly, he will think that he is wise like yourself! So that we have a
kind of hypothetical command:

Do this, and you will see that;

Do that, and you will see, &c.] Here it is the command not to flatter
a wicked king; and this explains the word “both” in verse 22, and the
reference to “people” and “nations” in verse 24. Unless the Ellipsis is
thus supplied, the meaning is not clear.

That which is a true admonition as to kingcraft, is also a solemn
warning as to priestcraft. The “wise” makes no difference between a
so-called priest and another man; for he knows that all the people of
God are made “priests unto God” (Rev. 1:6), and “an holy priest-hood”
(1Ре. 2:5). Those who make a difference do so to their own loss, and
to the dishonour of Christ.

Isa. 53:12.-“Therefore will | divide him a portion with the great, and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong”; i.e., “Therefore will | [Jehovah]
divide (or apportion) to him a great multitude [for booty], and the
strong ones will he (i.e., Messiah) divide as spoil.”

The structure shows that 53:12 corresponds with, and is to be
explained by 52:15. The passage is concerning:-

Jehovah's Servant-the Sin Offering.

А 52:13. His Presentation.

В 14. His Affliction.
C 15. His Reward.
&А 53:1-3. His Reception.
В 4-10. His Affliction.
© 10-12. His Reward.

Hence the “many nations” of 52:15, answer to the “great
multitudes” of 53:12; and “the kings” of 52:15 answer to “the strong
ones” of 53:12. Thus the two passages explain each other. The first
line of verse 12 is what Jehovah divides to His Servant; and the
second line is what He divides as Victor for Himself and His host.
Compare Psa. 110:2-5, Rev. 19:11-16.

The word PK] (nazah) in 52:15, means to leap, leap out: of

liquids, to spurt out as blood: of people, to leap up from joy or
astonishment. So the astonishment of verse 15 answers to that of
verse 14. Moreover the verb is in the Hiphil, and means to cause
astonishment.* [Note: See Things to Come, August, 1898.]
Jer. 16:7.-“Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning.”
The word tear is ᾧμιο (paras) to break, cleave, divide. So that the
Ellipsis will be, “Neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning”
(as Eze. 24:17, Hos. 9:4, etc., and A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,
or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]
and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).

See under Idiom.

Jer. 8:4.-“Thus saith the Lord, Shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he
turn away and not return?”

This is unintelligible, and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] is no clearer:-“Shall one turn away and not turn again?”
The fact is that the Massorah* [Note: See note on this passage in
Ginsburg’s Edition of the Hebrew Bible.] calls attention to this
passage as one of several examples where two connected words are
wrongly divided. Here, the first letter of the second of these two words
should be the last letter of the preceding word. Then the sense comes
out most beautifully:

“Shall they return [fo the Lord]
And He not return [to them]?”

Agreeing with Mal. 3:7, and with the context; and bringing out the
parallel between the two lines as well as exhibiting more clearly the
figure of Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which 5εε.])

Mat. 11:18.-“John came neither eating nor drinking.”

Clearly there must be an Ellipsis here; for John, being human,
could not live without food. The sense is clear in the Hebrew idiom,
which requires the Ellipsis to be thus supplied in the English:-

“John came neither eating [with others] nor drinking [strong drink].”
See Luk. 1:15. Or, observing the force of the Greek negative: “John
came [declining invitations] to eat and drink.”
Luk. 9:52.-“And sent messengers before his face; and they went,
and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready ... for
him,” i.e., to prepare reception for him.

Joh. 15:6.-“If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch,
and is withered; and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and
they are burned.”

Here the accusative “them” is not repeated.

But the meaning of the verse is obscured, or rather a new meaning
is read into it by inconsistency of rendering. Why, we ask, are the
words ἐὰν µή (ean mee) translated “except” twice in verse 4, and here
in verse 6 “if ... not’? It is an expression that occurs fifty-two times,
and more than thirty of these are rendered “except.”t [Note: See Mat.
5:20; Mat. 12:29; Mat. 18:3; Mat. 26:42. Mar. 3:27; Mar. 7:3-4. Joh.
3:2-3; Joh. 3:5; Joh. 3:27; Joh. 4:48; Joh. 6:44; Joh. 6:53; Joh. 6:65;
Joh. 12:24; Joh. 15:4 (twice); 20:25. Act. 8:31; Act. 15:1; Act. 27:31.
Rom. 10:15. 10ο. 14:6-7; 10ο. 14:9; 1Co. 15:36. 2Th. 2:3. 2Ti. 2:5.
Rev. 2:5; Rev. 2:22. yi (ei mee), if not, is also rendered “except” Mat.
19:9; Mat. 24:22. Mar. 13:20. Joh. 19:11. Rom. 7:7; Rom. 9:29. 2Co.
12:13.] Here it should be rendered “Except anyone abide in me.” In
the preceding verses the Lord had been speaking of His disciples
“you” and “ye.” Here in verse 6 He makes a general proposition
concerning anyone. Not, if anyone who is already in Him does not
continue in Him, for He is not speaking of a real branch; but except
anyone is abiding in Him he is cast forth “AS a branch.”

Likewise, in verse 2, the verb is αἴρω (8/6) to lift up, * [Note: As in
Luk. 17:13. Joh. 11:41. Act. 4:24. Rev. 10:5.] raise up. “Every branch
in me that beareth not fruit he lifteth up,” ie., He raises it from the
ground where it can bear no fruit, and tends it, that it may bring forth
fruit, “and every branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth it, that it may
bring forth more fruit.”

Thus there are two conditions spoken of-two kinds of branches:
one that bears no fruit, and one that does. The former He raises up
that it may bear fruit, and the latter He prunes that it may bear more.
Act. 9:34.-“Arise, and make thy bed.”

Here both versions translate the figure. The Greek reads, “Arise,
and spread for thyself,” /.e., spread [a bed] for thyself: in other words,
“make thy bed.”

Act. 10:10.-“But while they made ready, he fell into a trance,” i.e.,
while they made ready [the food].
Rom. 15:28.-“When therefore | have performed this, and have sealed
to them this fruit, | will come by you into Spain”: i.e., “When, therefore,
| have performed this business.”

1Со. 3:1.-“And |, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual
[men], but as unto carnal [men].” (See under 1Co. 2:2).

1Co. 7:17.-“But as God hath distributed to every man.”

This is literally:-“Only as God hath apportioned [the giff] to each.”
1Co. 10:24.-“Let no man seek his own [advantage only], but every
man that of his neighbour [a/so].”

“Wealth,” in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] is the old English word for well-being
generally. As we pray in the Litany, “In all time of our wealth”; and in
the expression, “Commonwealth,” i.e., common weal. Compare verse
33, where the word “profit” is used. The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] supplies “good.”
2Co. 5:16.-“Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh
(κατὰ σάρκα, kata sarka, according to flesh, i.e., according to natural
standing): yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now,
henceforth know we him [thus] no more.”
Our standing is now a spiritual one, “in Christ” risen from the dead;
a standing on resurrection ground, as the members of the Mystical or
Spiritual Body of Christ.
2Co. 5:20.-“Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled
to God.”

Here the word “you” is incorrectly supplied. Paul was not
beseeching the saints in Corinth to be reconciled to God. They were
reconciled as verse 18 declares, “Who hath reconciled us to himself
by Jesus Christ.” Then in verse 19 he goes on to speak of “men”; and
in verse 20 he says that he beseeches them, as though God did
beseech them by us; we pray them in Christ's stead, and say:-“Be ye
reconciled to God.” This was the tenor of his Gospel to the
unconverted.
2Co. 11:20.-“If a man take [your goods].”

Php. 3:13.-“Brethren, | count not myself to have apprehended [the
prize (from verse 14)].”

1Th. 3:1.-“When we could no longer forbear.” Here στέγω (stegd)
means {ο hold out, to bear, to endure, and must have the accusative
supplied:-“Wherefore, when we could no longer bear [our anxiety],
etc.” The same Ellipsis occurs in verse 5, where it must be similarly
supplied.

2Th. 2:6-7.-“And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only
he who now letteth will /et, until he be taken out of the way.”

Here, there is an Ellipsis. But the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] treats it as though
it were the verb that is omitted, and repeats the verb “will let.” The R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] avoids this, by translating it
thus:-“only there is one that restraineth now, until, etc.”

Both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] fail
to see that it is the Ellipsis of the accusative after the verb in both
verses. The verb is κατέχω (katechd), which is rendered “withhold” in
verse 6 and “/ef’ in verse 7 (and in Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] “restrain” in both verses). But this verb, being transitive, must
have an object or accusative case after it; and, as it is omitted by
Ellipsis, it has therefore to be supplied.
The verb κατέχω (katech6) means to have and hold fast. The
preposition κατά (kata), in composition, does not necessarily preserve
its meaning of down, to hold down; but it may be intensive, and mean
to hold firmly, to hold fast, to hold in secure possession. This is proved
by its usage; which clearly shows that restraining or withholding is no
necessary part of its meaning. It occurs nineteen times, and is
nowhere else so rendered. On the other hand there are four or five
other words which might have been better used had “restrain” been
the thought in this passage.

Indeed its true meaning is fixed by its use in these epistles. In 1Th.
5:21 we read “hold fast that which is good,” not restrain it or “withhold”
that which is good! But the idea is of keeping and retaining and
holding on fast to that which is proved to be good. So it is in all the
passages where the word occurs:-

Mat. 21:38. Let us seize on his inheritance.

Luk. 4:42. And stayed him, that he should not depart.

Luk. 8:15. Having heard the word, keep it.

Luk. 14:9. Thou begin with shame {ο take the lowest room.
Joh. 5:4. Of whatsoever disease he had (i.e., was held).

Act. 27:40. And made toward shore (i.e., they held their
course, or kept going for the shore).

Rom. 1:18. Who hold the truth in unrighteousness.

Rom. 7:6. Being dead to that wherein we were held (margin
and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ).

10ο. 7:30. As though they possessed not.

10ο. 11:2. And keep the ordinances.

10ο. 15:2. If ye keep in memory what | preached.

2Co. 6:10. And yet possessing all things.

1Th. 5:21. Hold fast that which is good.

Phm. 1:13. Whom | would have retained with me.

Heb. 3:6. If we hold fast the confidence.

Heb. 3:14. If we hold the beginning
Heb. 10:23. Let us hold fast the profession.

This fixes for us the meaning of the verb κατέχω. But what is it that
thus holds fast “the man of sin’? and who is it that holds fast
something which is not mentioned, and which has therefore to be
supplied? For, in verse 6, that which holds fast is neuter, τὸ KaTéxov
(to katechon), while in verse 7 it is masculine © κατέχων (ho
katech6n):so that in verse 6 it is something (neuter) which holds the
man of sin fast, while in verse 7 some one is holding fast to
something.

We submit that in verse 6, that something is τὸ φρέαρ (to phrear)
the pit (Rev. 9:1-2; Rev. 11:7) out of which he ascends, and in which
he is now kept in sure possession until the season arrive when he is to
be openly revealed: meanwhile, his secret counsels and plans are
already working, preparing the way for his revelation.

The whole subject of the context is the revelation of two person-
ages (not of one), viz., “the man of sin” (verse 3) and “the lawless one”
(verse 8). These correspond with the two beasts of Rev. 13:1-18

This is clear from the structure of the first twelve verses of this
chapter:-* [Note: See The Structure of the Two Epistles to the
Thessalonians by the same author and publisher.]
2Th. 2:1-12.
А 1-3-. Exhortation not to be believing what the apostle did not
say.
В -3, 4. Reason. “For, etc.”
Α 5,6. Exhortation to believe what the apostle did say.
В 7-12. Reason. “For, etc.”
Or more fully, thus:-
А 1-3-. Exhortation (negative).
В а -3-. The Apostasy (open).
Ь -3. The Revelation of the “Man of Sin.” (The Beast
from the Sea, Rev. 13:1-10).
ο 4. The character of his acts. See Rev. 13:6-8.
Α 5-6. Exhortation (positive).
В а 7.Lawlessness (secret working).
Ь — 8. The Revelation of the Lawless one. (The Beast
from the Earth, Rev. 13:11-18).
c 9-12. The character of his acts. See Rev.
13:13-15.

Thus the open working Of the apostasy and the secret working of
the counsels of the Lawless one are set in contrast. We must note that
the word “mystery” means a secret, a secret plan or purpose, secret
counsel.* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.]

Thus we have here two subjects: (1) “The Man of Sin” (the beast
from the sea, Rev. 13:1-10), and the open apostasy which precedes
and marks his revelation; (2) “The Lawless one” (the beast from the
earth, Rev. 13:11-18), and the working of his secret counsels which
precedes his revelation, and the ejection of the Devil from the heavens
which brings it about.

An attempt has been made to translate the words, ἐκ μέσου
γένηται (ek mesou geneetai) be taken out of the way, as meaning,
“arise out of the midst.” But this translates an idiomatic expression
literally; which cannot be done without introducing error. ἐκ µέσου
γένηται is an idiom,t [Note: See below under the figure Idioma.] for
being gone away, or being absent or away.

This is clear from the other places where the idiomatic expression
occurs.} [Note: in Mat. 13:49, the wicked are severed from among the
just’ (1.е., taken away). In Act. 17:33, “Paul departed from among
them” (1.е., went away). In 23:10, he was taken “by force from among
them” (1.е., taken out of the way). 1Co. 5:2 is very clear, where he
complains that they had not mourned that “he that hath done this thing
might be taken away from among you.” In 2Co. 6:17, we are
commanded, “Wherefore come out from among them and be ye
separate.” In Col. 2:14 we read of the handwriting of ordinances which
was against us; Christ “took it out of the way.” We have the same in
the Septuagint in Isa. 52:11 : “Depart ye.... go ye out of the midst of
her,” and Isa. 57:1 : “the righteous is taken away from the evil to
come.”

The same usage is seen in Classical writers-Plutarch (Timol. p.
288, 3): “He determined to live by himself, having got himself out of
the way,” i.e., from the public; Herodotus (3, 83; and 8, 22): The
speaker exhorts some to “be on our side; but, if this is impossible,
then sit down out of the way,” i.e., leave the coast clear as we should
say, keep neutral and stand aside. The same idiom is seen in Latin-
Terence (Phorm. v. 8, 30): “She is dead, she is gone from among us”
(Θ medio abiit). The opposite expression shows the same thing. In
Xenophon (Cyr. 5, 2, 26), one asks, “What stands in the way of your
joining us?” (£2 2?2w 71222).

Thus the lawless one is, at present, being held fast in the pit (while
his secret counsels are at work); and the Devil is holding On to his
position in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:2; Eph. 6:12). But presently there
will be “war in Heaven” (Rev. 12:1-17), and Satan will be cast out into
the earth. Then in Rev. 13:1, we read, “and he (Satan) stood upon the
sand of the sea” (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) Then it is
that he will call up this lawless one, whom John immediately sees
rising up out of the sea to run his brief career, and be destroyed by the
glory of the Lord’s appearing.
The complete rendering therefore of these two verses (1Th. 2:6-7),
will be as follows:-“And now ye know what holds him [the lawless one]
fast, to the end that he may be revealed in his own appointed season.
For the secret counsel of lawlessness doth already work; only, there is
one [Satan] who at present holds fast [fo his possessions in the
heavenlies], until he be cast out [into the earth, Rev. 12:9-12; and
“stand upon the sand of the sea,” Rev. 13:1, R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ], and then shall be revealed that lawless one whom
the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with
the brightness of his coming” (Isa. 11:4).

Jam. 5:3.-“Ye have heaped treasure together for the, last days.” The
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is tame in comparison with
this, “Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.” θησαυρίζω
(theesaurizo) means simply to treasure up. In Rom. 2:5, we have the
expression “treasurest up wrath.” So here, there is the Ellipsis of what
is treasured up. We may supply “wrath” here. “Ye have treasured up
[wrath] for the last days,” or in last (or final) days, ie., days of
extremity.

1Pe. 2:23.-“But committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.”

Here the omitted accusative is supplied, but it is a question
whether it ought to be “himself,” or rather as in the margin both of A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] “his cause.”
3. The omission of the Pronoun

Where there can be no doubt to whom or to what the noun refers, the
pronoun is frequently omitted in the Greek, and in most cases is
supplied in italic type in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

The omission of the pronoun makes it more emphatic, attention
being called more prominently to it.
Mat. 19:13.-“That He should put the hands [of Him] upon them,” i.e.,
His hands.
Mat. 21:7.-“And put on them the clothes [of them]’ i.e., their garments,
“and he sat upon them.” This is the reading of the critical editions.
Mar. 5:23.-“Come and lay the hands [of thee] upon her” i.e., thy
hands. Where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] does not even put thy in italics. Compare
Mat. 9:18, where the pronoun (σου, sou) thy is used.
Mar. 6:5.-“And he laid the hands [of him] upon a few sick folk,” i.e., his
hands. So also 8:25, 16:18; Act. 9:17.

Luk. 24:40.-“And when He had thus spoken, He showed them the
hands and the feet [of Him], i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “his hands and
his feet.”

Joh. 11:41.-“And Jesus lifted up the eyes [of Him],” {6., his eyes.

Act. 13:3.-“And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid the hands
[of them] on them,” i.e., their hands on them.

Act. 19:6.-“And when Paul had laid the hands [of him] upon them,”
ie., his hands.

Eph. 3:17-18.-“That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may know
what is the breadth [of if], and length [of if], and the depth [of if], and
the height [of if],” i.e., of love. “That ye may know what is [its] breadth,
and length, and depth, and height, etc.”

Heb. 4:15.-“But was in all points tempted. according to the likeness [of
us] apart from sin,” /.е., according to [our] likeness.
Rom. 6:3-4.-Мау be perhaps best explained by this figure. “Know ye
not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus, unto his
death we were baptized? Therefore we were buried together with him
by the baptism [of him] (i.e., by his baptism) unto death.” For He had
“a cup” to drink of (His death), and “a baptism to be baptized with” (His
burial), and when He died and was buried, His people died and were
buried with Him, and, as the next verse goes on to say, rose again
with Him.

So the passage reads: “Therefore we were buried with him by his
baptism-unto-death [/е., his burial], in order that just as Christ was
raised from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also, in
newness of life should walk. For if we have become identified in the
likeness of his death, certainly in that of his resurrection also we shall
be: knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with [him] in
order that the body of sin may be annulled, that we should no longer
be in servitude to sin. For he that hath died hath been righteously
acquitted from the sin [of him], i.e., his sin. Now if we died together
with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with him.”

The whole argument lies in this that we are reckoned as having
died with Him, and as having been buried with Him in His burial (or
baptism-unto-death). (See Mat. 20:23; Mar. 10:38-39; Luk. 12:50).
Hence all such are free from the dominion and condemnation of sin,
and stand in the newness of resurrection life. This is “the gospel of the
glory” (2Co. 4:4), for it was by the glory of the Father that Christ was
raised, and it is glorious news indeed which tells us that all who are in
Christ are “complete in Him” (Col. 2:10), “accepted in the beloved”
(Eph. 1:6), “perfect in Christ Jesus” (Col. 1:28).

With this agrees Col. 2:10-12. “And ye are complete in him, which
is the head of all principality and power. In whom (ἐν (), en hé) also ye
are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting
off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;
buried with him in the baptism [of him] i.e., in his baptism-unto-death,
in whom (ἐν ᾧ, not “wherein,” but as it is rendered above) ye were
raised together also through the faith of the operation of God, who
raised him from among the dead,” etc.

Here, again, the whole argument turns on the fact that the
“circumcision” and the “baptism” spoken of are both “made without
hands,” and both are fulfilled in Christ. The whole context of these two
passages must be studied in order to see the one point and the great
truth which is revealed: viz., that in His death we are circumcised and
cut off, “crucified with Him” (Rom. 6:6): in His burial (or baptism-unto-
death) we are baptized (Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12): and in His resurrection
we now have our true standing before God. We have all in Christ.
Hence, our completeness and perfection in Him is such that nothing
can be added to it. All who are baptized by Him with the Holy Spirit are
identified with Him in His death, burial, and resurrection. Hence, those
who are being baptized are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not
(1Co. 15:29, see below), for they do not rise if Christ be not raised.
But, if Christ be raised, then we are raised in Him; and “Christ being
raised from the dead dieth no more ... for in that he died, he died unto
sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise ye
also reckon yourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, IN
CHRIST JESUS” (Rom. 6:8-11).
Rom. 2:18.-Thou “makest thy boast of God, and knowest the will [of
him],” i.e., his will: the will of God.
1Ti. 6:1.-“That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.”
The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads “that the name of
God and the doctrine be not blasphemed,” but it is better “the doctrine
[of him],” i.e., his doctrine, as in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

4. The Omission of Other Connected Words
1Ki. 3:22.-“Thus they spake before the king.” It is not to be supposed
that two women under these exciting circum-stances would confine
themselves to the few concise words of verse 22! Moreover, there is
no “thus” in the Hebrew. Literally it reads-“and they talked before the
king,” {9., “they talked [very much] or kept talking before the king.”
2Ki. 6:25.-“An ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and
the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.” Here it
is more correct to supply (with the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] margin) “shekels” instead of “pieces,” and translate “was at
eighty shekels of silver.”
2Ki. 25:3.-“And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine
prevailed.”

The Hebrew reads, “and on the ninth month.” But the Ellipsis is
correctly supplied from Jer. 52:6.

Psa. 119:56.-‘This | had, because | kept thy precepts;” ie., this
[consolation] | had. Luther supplies the word “treasure.”

Jer. 51:31.-“One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger
to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at
one end.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates “on every
quarter”! Another version renders it “to its utmost end.” Another “at the
extremity.” Thus it is clear that there is an Ellipsis, and much confusion
in supplying it.

The Hebrew is “from the end”: or with the Ellipsis supplied “from
[each] end.” So in chap. 50:26 (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ), “come against her from the utmost border.” (Margin:
“Hebrew, from the end”), i.e., as we have suggested, “from [each]
end.”

And so the prophecy was exactly fulfilled. The Babylonians, after
their first discomfiture by Cyrus in the field, retired to the city ... and,
85 Herodotus says, “remained т their holds.”* [Note: ?
i 2222222222.... ἐσσωθέντες 2ῇ 222 22222222222? E? 20 G???.
Herod. Hist. lib. i. §190. See also Xenophon, Cyrop. lib. vii. Compare
Jer. 51:30, “The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they
have remained in their holds.”]

The forces of Cyrus, having turned the waters of the Euphrates,
entered the city by the bed of the river at each end; and the
messengers who entered at the end where the waters quitted the city
ran to meet those who had come in where the waters entered the city;
so that they met one another. Herodotus expressly describes this in
his history (book i. §191). Those who were at the extremities were at
once slain, while those in the centre were feasting in utter ignorance of
what was going on. See Dan. 5:3-4; Dan. 5:23; Dan. 5:30. Thus the
correct supply of the Ellipsis is furnished and established by the exact
fulfilment of the prophecy, proving the wonderful accuracy of the
Divine Word.

Eze. 13:18.-“Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes.”
This may be translated literally, “Woe to those who sew together
coverings upon all joints of [the people ой my hands,” i.e., my people.
The context supplies the Ellipsis, for the subject is the deception of
God’s people by the false prophets; and the covering and veiling of
verse 18 corresponds to the daubing and coating of verse 14, etc.,
ie., the making things easy for the people so that they should not
attend to God’s word.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads, “that sew
pillows upon all elbows,” margin, “Heb. joints of the hands.” A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin, “elbows.”

Mat. 19:17.-“Keep the commandments,” i.e., of God.

Mar. 6:14-16.-The parenthesis in verse 14 must be extended to the
end of verse 15. What Herod said is stated in verse 16. The rumour of
what others said is stated in the parenthesis:-“And king Herod heard
[of these mighty works]; (for his name was spread abroad, and [one]
+ [Note: The Greek reads ἔλεγεν (elegen), one said. The reading put
by Tr. and R.V. in the margin, and by Lachmann, and Westcott and
Hort in the Text is esis (elegon) some said.] said that John the
Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show
forth themselves in him. Others said, It is Elias; and others said, It is a
prophet, or as one of the prophets). But when Herod heard* [Note:
Repeated from verse 14.] thereof, + [Note: Or when Herod heard
these various opinions.] he said, It is John whom | beheaded: he 15
risen from the dead.”

Luk. 14:18.-“They all with one consent began to make excuse.”

ἀπὸ μιᾶς (apo mias) with one [mind], or with one [declining]: i.e.,

they all alike began to decline the invitation.
Joh. 3:13.-“No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came
down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven.” The
words translated “which is” are © ὤν (ho 6n) the article, and the
present participle of the verb “to be’-literally, the one being: i.e., who
was being, or simply who was. Compare Joh. 1:18 “who was (0 ὤν) in
the bosom of the Father.” Joh. 9:25, “Whereas | was blind” (τυφλὸς
ὤν). Joh. 19:38, “being a disciple,” i.e., who was a disciple. Luk.
24:44, “I spake whilst | was yet with you” (ἔτι ὤν, ей δη). 2Co. 8:9,
“Though he was rich” (πλούσιος ὤν, plousios 6n).

Hence our verse reads, “Even the Son of Man who was in
heaven.” This agrees with Joh. 6:62, where we have the words, “What
and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?”

The fact taught us by this is, that the human body of the Lord
Jesus cannot be in more than one place at the same time. This fact
cuts at the roots of all errors that are based on any presence of Christ
on earth during this present dispensation. The presence of the Holy
Spirit is the witness to the absence of Christ. There can be no
presence of Christ now except by the Holy Spirit. He will be present
again bodily only at His personal return from Heaven. Now He is
seated at the right hand of God, “henceforth expecting,” until the
moment arrives for God to place His enemies as a footstool for His
feet, when He shall rise up to receive His people to Himself and come
with and reign until He shall have put all enemies under His feet. (See
above, page 7).
Any presence, therefore, of Christ in the Lord’s Supper, other than
by His Spirit in our hearts,t [Note: See the Rubrick at the end of the
Communion Service of the Church of England.] is a denial of His real
human nature, and of His return from Heaven: and this is an error
which affects both the first and second Advents. The Lord’s Supper,
therefore, is the witness of His rea/ absence; for it is instituted only “till
He come.” And not until that glorious day will there be any “real
presence” on earth. And then it will be a bodily presence, for it is “on
the Mount of Olives,” that His feet will rest, and “on Mount Zion” that
He shall reign.

Act. 10:36.-“The word which God sent unto the children of Israel
preaching peace by Jesus Christ.”

The Ellipsis here is caused by a Hebraism, as in Hag. 2:5.
“According to the word that | covenanted with you,” etc. So this will
read, “[According to] the word which God sent, etc.”

Or it may be taken as parallel to Psa. 107:20. “He sent his word,
and healed them.” So Isa. 9:8. God “sent” when His Son came,
through whom God proclaimed the Gospel of peace. Hence “[This is]
the word which God sent.”

Act. 18:22.-“And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up ...
and saluted the Church, he went down to Antioch,” i.e., “Gone up [to
Jerusalem].” As is clear from verse 21, as well as from the
circumstances of the case.

Rom. 2:27.-“And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil
the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost trangress
the law?”

Here we have, first, to note the figure of Hendiadys (q.v. [Note:
Which see.] ) “letter and circumcision” and translate it /iteral
circumcision. And next we have to preserve the emphasis marked by
the order of the words, which we can well do if we correctly supply the
Ellipsis:-

“And shall not uncircumcision which by nature fulfilleth the law,
condemn thee [though thou art a Jew], who, through the literal
circumcision, art a trangressor of the law?”

Rom. 11:11.-“l say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall [for
ever]? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.” The fall mentioned here
must be interpreted by verse 1 “cast away,” and verse 25 “until,” and
by the condition of verse 23. Is their fall the object or end of their
stumbling? See Joh. 11:4.

Rom. 12:19.-“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give
place unto wrath.” This does not mean “yield to the wrath of your
enemy,” but “give place to the wrath* [Note: <fj ὀσ]ῇ (tee orgee).] [of
God], for (the reason is given) it is written, Vengeance is mine; | will
repay, saith the Lord.”

Rom. 14:2.-“For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who
is weak [in the faith], eateth herbs [only].”

Rom. 14:5.-“One man esteemeth one day above another,” i.e., “one
man indeed (μέν), esteemeth one day [more holy] than another; but
(δὲ) another esteemeth every day [alike].”

Rom. 14:20.-“All things indeed are pure,” {6., “all [meats] indeed [are]
clean; but [it is] evil to the man who eateth with offence [to his weak
brother).” “Clean” here means ceremonially clean, and hence, allowed
to be eaten.

Rom. 14:23.-“And he that doubteth is damned (or condemned) if he
eat,” i.e., “and he that holdeth a difference [between meats] is
condemned if he eat, because [he eateth] not from (ἐκ) faith; for
whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”

1Co. 7:6.-“But | speak this [which | have said] by permission and not
commandment.”

1Co. 9:9-10.-“Doth God take care for oxen [only]? Or saith he it
altogether for our sakes?”
1Co. 12:6.-The expression “all in all” is elliptical: and the sense must
be completed according to the nature of the subject and the context,
both here, and in the other passages where it occurs.

Here, “it is the same God, which worketh all [these gifts] in all [the
members of Christ's body]:” what these gifts are, and who these
members are, is fully explained in the immediate context. See verses
4-31.
1Co. 15:28.-“Then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that
put all things under him, that God may be all in all.” The word πάντα
occurs six times in the 27th and 28th verses and is in each case
translated correctly “all things” except in this last occurrence. We have
no liberty to change the translation here. It must be “all things,” and to
complete the sense we must render it “that God may be [over] all
things, in all [places]; i.e., over all beings in all parts of the universe.
Eph. 1:23.-“The church, which is His body, the fulness* [Note: The
termination of the word @uu: denotes the result or product of the verb
to fill, i.e., of the act of the verb. Hence this fulness means a filling up
in exchange for emptiness. His members fill up the Body of Christ, and
He fills up the members with all spiritual gifts and graces.] of him that
filleth all in all.” Here, we must supply:-“that filleth all [fhe members of
His body] with all [spiritual gifts and graces].” Compare chap. 4:10-13.
Col. 3:11.-“Christ is all, and in all.” Here the Greek is slightly different
from the other occurrences, but it is still elliptical; and the sense must
be completed thus:-In the new creation “there is neither Greek nor
Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor
free: but Christ is [created in] all [who believe] and in all [places of the
world],” i.e., Πο man is excluded on account of earthly considerations
of condition or location from the blessings and benefits of the new
creation. See Gal. 3:28, where the same truth is expressed in different
words.
1Co. 14:27.-“If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two,
or at the most three [sentences, or perhaps, persons] and that by
course (i.e., separately); and let one interpret.”
2Co. 1:6.-“And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
salvation, which is effectual [in you] in the enduring of the same
sufferings which we also suffer, etc.”
2Co. 5:5.-“Now he that hath wrought us for the self same [desire], is
God.”
Gal. 5:10.-“I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
none otherwise minded.”

The Greek reads “that you will think nothing differently [from me].”
Php. 1:18.-“What then [does it matter]? at any rate, in every way,
whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and | therein do
rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”
1Th. 3:7.-“Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
affliction and distress by your faith,” i.e., “by [the news received of]
your faith.”
1Th. 4:1.-“As ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please God, so ye would abound more and more [therein].” See also
verse 10.
Heb. 13:25.-“Grace be with you all,” i.e., “The grace [of God be] with
you all.”
1Jn. 5:15.-“And if we know that he hear us [concerning] whatsoever
we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.”
1Jn. 5:19.-“The whole world lieth in wickedness:” R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] , “in the wicked one.” But this is not English.
The Ellipsis must be supplied thus:-“The whole World lieth in [the
power of] the wicked one.”

Il. The Omission of Verbs and Participles
A verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer, and
expresses the action, the suffering, or the being, or the doing.

When therefore the verb is omitted, it throws the emphasis on the
thing that is done rather than on the doing of it.

On the other hand, when the noun is omitted, our thought is
directed to the action of the verb, and is centred on that rather than on
the object or the subject.

Bearing this in mind, we proceed to consider a few examples:-

1. When the Verb Finite is wanting
Gen. 25:28.-“And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his
venison.” Or it may be that there is no Ellipsis, and it may mean
“because hunting was in his [Esau’s] mouth,” i.e., on his tongue.

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] has given a very free translation. But here again,
the correct supply of the words omitted enables us to retain a literal
rendering of the words that are given: “because the food taken by him
in hunting [was sweet, or was pleasanif] in his mouth.”
Num. 16:28.-“And Moses said, ‘Hereby ye shall know that the Lord
hath sent me to do all these works; for not of my own mind.’ ”

Here we may render it, “for not of mine own heart [have | said
these things]. See verse 24.
1Sa. 19:3.-“I will commune with my father of thee; and what | see, that
| will tell thee.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates “and if |
see aught.” But the Hebrew with the Ellipsis supplied, is: “and will see
what [he replies], and will tell thee.”
2Sa. 4:10.-“When one told me, saying, behold, Saul is dead, thinking
to have brought good tidings, | took hold of him, and slew him in
Ziklag, who thought that | would have given him a reward for his
tidings.”

Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] has supplied the verb “thought,” but perhaps the
verb “had come” is better, i.e., “who [had come] that | should give him
a reward for his tidings.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates, “which
was the reward | gave him for his tidings.”
2Sa. 18:12.-“Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.”

2Sa. 23:17.-This is a case in which the Ellipsis is wrongly supplied in
the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] “And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord, that | should do
this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their
lives?”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] rightly supplies from
1Ch. 11:19, “Be it far from me, О Lord, that | should do this: shail |
drink the blood of the men, etc.”
1К!. 11:25.-“And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of
Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did,” i.e., that Hadad
wrought or brought upon him.
1Ki. 14:6.-“I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.” The Hebrew is, “I am
sent to thee hard.”

The Ellipsis may thus be supplied: “I am sent to thee [fo tell thee,
or to bring thee, or to prophesy to thee] hard [things]. See verse 5.
1К!. 22:36.-“And there went a proclamation throughout the host about
the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every
man to his own country.” Here the verb return is to be supplied. “Let
every man return to his city, etc.,” or “[Return] every man to his city,
etc.”

2Ki. 25:24.-The word “fled” is not in the Hebrew. The Ellipsis is thus
supplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
correctly in italics.
Ezr. 10:14.-“Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let
all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges
thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned
away.”

The Hebrew of the last clause reads, “Until (TI) the fierce wrath of our
God be turned back from us, until (TI) this matter [be carried οι.”

This filling up of the Ellipsis enables us to take the other words in
the verse literally. The non-observance of the figure leads the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] to give two different meanings (viz., “until” and “for’) to the
word TI until, which is used twice in the same passage.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads, “Until the
fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be
dispatched,” and gives an alternative in the margin for the last clause
“as touching this matter.”

Ezr. 10:19.-“And being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their
trespass.”
Here the Ellipsis of the verb is properly supplied.
Job. 3:21.-“Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
than for hid treasures [but find it nof].”
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] supplies the first verb, but not the second.
Job. 4:6.-“/s not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
uprightness of thy ways?”
The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders it:-“Is not thy
fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways?”
These two lines are arranged as an introversion in the Hebrew:-
Is not thy fear
thy confidence?
And thy hope
the integrity of thy ways?
Or by transposing the words they may be exhibited as an alternation:
Is not thy fear thy confidence?
And the integrity of thy ways, thy hope?

It should be noted that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or

current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] of 1611 originally read, “/s not
this thy feare thy confidence; the uprightness of thy wayes and thy
hope?” The change first appears in the Cambridge edition of 1638.
But by whom this and many similar unauthorised changes have been
made in the text of the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] of 1611, is not known, and can only
be conjectured!* [Note: See Appendix Α.]
Job. 39:13 seems to have caused much trouble to the translators.
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] reads, “Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the
peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?” The R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] and other versions which ignore the
Ellipsis (which the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies) have to give a very
unnatural translation, and miss the challenge which is connected with
all the other wonders of God’s works in these chapters.

The scanty featherless wing of the ostrich (LUPP/H renana, not
peacock) is contrasted with the warm full-feathered wing of the stork(C/ Г.
chaseedah, not ostrich), and man is challenged, “Didst thou give
either the one or the other?”

Psa. 4:2.-°О ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into
shame?”
Psa. 22:16.-“They pierced my hands and my feet.” Through not
seeing the Ellipsis of the verb in this verse, the word in the Hebrew
text nan (karee), as a lion, has been translated as though it were
a verb Лаше (karoo) they pierced.t (Note: In the first case the Kaph
Л is rendered “as” and is prefixed to alun (aree) a lion; in the latter
case it forms part of the verb JILU@=(karoo).] But we have no
authority thus to ignore the printed text. On the contrary, verse 16
corresponds exactly with verse 12. In verse 12 we have two animals,
“bulls” and “a lion” (the first plural, and the second singular). So also
we have in verse 16, two animals, “dogs” and “a lion.” If, however, we
take karee as a noun, there is an Ellipsis of the verb, which we may
well supply from Isa. 38:13, and then we may translate the rest
literally: “As a lion [they will break up] my hands and my feet.”* [Note:
See Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Hebrew Bible,
р. 969.]
The structure of the passage proves that this is the case. Verses
12-17 form the Centre of this part of the Psalm:-
А 12-13. They. Beasts surrounding: “bulls” (pl. [Note: |. The
Plural Number.] ), and “a lion” (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular
Number,] ).
В 14-15. |. The consequence. “I am poured out like water.”

А 16. They. Beasts surrounding: “dogs” (pl. [Note: |. The Plural
Number.] ), and “a lion” (sing. [Note: ing. The Singular
Number,] ).

В 17. Ι. The consequence. “I may tell all my bones.”
Psa. 25:15.-“Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,” /е., “mine eyes
are ever lifted up or looking toward the Lord.” See Psa. 121:1. The
verb is omitted, that We may not think of the act of looking, but at the
object to which we look.
Psa. 120:7.-1 am for peace; but when | speak, they are for war.”
There are no verbs in the Hebrew, which is:-“l peace; but when |
speak, they for war.” The verbs to be supplied are doubtless, “I [/ove]
peace; but when | speak they [cry ouf] for war,” or “they break forth
into war.”
Ecc. 8:2.-“l counsel thee keep the king’s commandment.”
Isa. 60:7.-“For your shame ye shall have double.” Here the Ellipsis is
properly supplied. (See this passage under other Figures).
Isa. 66:6.-“A voice of noise (tumult, Ι.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] ) from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that
rendereth recompense to his enemies”: i.e., a voice of tumult is heard
from the city, a voice sounds forth from the temple, etc.
Jer. 18:14.-“Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from
the rock of the field?”

There is no sense whatever in this rendering, and the R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] is but tittle better: “Shall the snow of
Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?”

The Ellipsis is not to be supplied by the verb “cometh.” But it
should be:

“Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon for the rock of the field?

Or shall the cold flowing waters be forsaken for strange waters?”
Jer. 19:1.-“Go and get (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] buy)
a potter’s earthen vessel and take of the elders of the people, &c.”
Hos. 8:1.-“He shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord:”
ié., as an eagle shall the enemy come against the house of the Lord.
Amo. 3:11.-“Thus saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah): an adversary
there shall be, etc.” So the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
But “an adversary shall come,” would be better.”

Mat. 26:5.-“But they said, not on the feast day,” i.e., Let us not do it on
the feast day (so also Mar. 14:2).
Act. 15:25.-“Certain which went out from us have troubled you with
words, subverting your souls, saying, ye must be circumcised, and
keep the law,” {6., saying, ye ought to be circumcised, and to keep the
law.

Rom. 2:7-10.-There are several ellipses in these verses which may be
thus supplied.

“To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory
and honour and immortality [he will give] eternal life. But unto them
that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, [shall come] indignation and wrath, tribulation and
anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first and
also of the Gentile* [Note: In Deu. 28:53, this is applied to the Jew (cf.
Sept.). “In thy anguish and tribulation wherewith thine enemy shall
afflict thee.” (A.V., “In the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine
enemies shall distress thee”). Cf. Isa. 8:22.

While in Isa. 13:9, this is applied to the Gentile.

Thus these words are applied even in the Old Testament: “to the
Jew first, and also to the Gentile.”] ; but glory, honour, and peace [shall
be rendered] to every man that worketh good, to the dew first and also
to the Gentile.”
Rom. 4:9.-“Cometh this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or
upon the uncircumcision also?”

Le., “This blessedness, then, [cometh it only] on the circumcision?”
Rom. 6:19.-“For as ye have yielded your members servants to
uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your
members servants to righteousness unto holiness.”

Le., “To [work] iniquity”: and “to [work] holiness.”

Rom. 11:18.-“Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee,” {6., but if thou boast, / te/l thee
(or know thou) thou bearest not the root, but the root beareth thee.
Rom. 13:11.-“And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to
awake out of sleep, etc.”

The Greek is καὶ τοῦτο (kai touto), “and this [/ add or | exhort]
knowing the reason, that [it is] already the hour [for us] to awake out of
sleep.”
1Co. 2:12.-“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit which is of God.”

There is no verb in this latter clause, and the verb “is” which is
supplied in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] should be in italics. But “which [cometh] from
God,” is better; or “is received,” repeated from the previous sentence.
1Co. 4:20.-“For the kingdom of God {5 not in word but in power.”
There is no verb in the whole of this verse; consequently one must be
supplied:-“For the kingdom of God [is established or governed] not by
word (or speech as in verse 19) but by power.”

1Со. 14:33.-“For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as
in all churches of the saints.” There is no verb in the latter clause,
therefore one must be supplied. The word “God” may also be
repeated as in the Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :-

“For God is not [a God] of confusion, but of peace, as [He is] in all
churches of the saints.” Or, “as in all the churches of the saints [is well
known.”
2Co. 9:14.-“And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
exceeding grace of God in you.” The Greek is ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν (ΕρΗ΄ humin)
upon you, and requires the verb to be supplied, “for the exceeding
grace of God [bestowed] upon you.”
2Co. 12:18.-“I desired Titus [fo go to youl, etc.”

Gal. 5:13.-“Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.”
Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] supplies “use.” But it might well be “misuse or
abuse.”
Eph. 4:9.-“Now that he ascended.” The Greek reads as in R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] , “Now this, He ascended.” But the
Ellipsis must be supplied: “Now, this [fact]” or “Now, this [expression],
He ascended, what is it unless that he also descended first into the
lower parts of the earth?”

Eph. 5:9.-“For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
righteousness and truth:” i.e., [consists] in these things.

All the ancient MSS. and critical texts, and the R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] agree in reading φωτός (phdtos) of the light,
instead of πνεύματος (pneumatos) of the Spirit, and thus “the fruits of
the light” are contrasted with “the unfruitful works of darkness.”

Php. 3:15.-“Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded:”
i.e., [desire to be] perfect. There is no verb, and the word “be” ought to
have been put in italics.

1Ti. 2:6.-“Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
time.” Here there is no verb in the latter clause. The Greek reads, “the
testimony in due times “or in its own seasons. Hence the A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
has boldly substituted a Verb for the noun “to be testified”; while the
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has rendered it: “the
testimony to be borne in its own times.” We may supply the Ellipsis
more fully thus: “the testimony [of which, was to be borne by us] in his
own appointed season.”

The word “all” must be taken here in the sense of “all” without
distinction, because before Christ's death the ransom was only for one
nation-Israel. It cannot be “all” without exception, for in that case all
would and must be saved. See under Synecdoche.

Philem. 6.-“[/ pray] that the communication of thy faith may become
effectual, etc.”

1Pe. 4:11.-“If any man speak, Jet him speak, as the oracles of God
[require].

2Pe. 2:3.-“Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not.” There is
no “now” in the Greek. “Whose judgment [threatened] of old, lingereth
not. See Jud. 1:4.

1Jn. 3:20.-“For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
and knoweth all things.”

In the Greek, the word ὅτι (hoti), that, occurs twice, and the
construction is difficult. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] avoids it by translating the
first ὅτι “for,” and ignoring the second occurrence altogether. The R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] evades it by adopting for the first
ὅτι the reading (6 τι for ὅτι), which, beyond the Alexandrian Codex,
has scarcely any MS. support, and only that of one Textual critic
(Lachmann). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] connects
verse 20 with verse 10, and translates “and shall assure our heart
before him, whereinsoever our heart condemn us, because God is
greater, &c.” But this English is as difficult as the Greek.

The difficulty is met by supplying the ellipsis before the second ὅτι,
and translating it “that,” as it is rendered 613 times in the N.T.:-

“For if our heart condemn us [we know] that God is greater than
our heart.”

(a) The Verb “to say”

This is frequently omitted in the original, but is generally supplied in
italics in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.]

Where it is omitted the emphasis is to be placed on what is said
rather than on the act of saying it.
Gen. 26:7.-“Lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me.”
1Ki. 20:34.-“Then said Ahab.”
Psa. 2:2.-“Why do ... the rulers take counsel together against the
Lord, and against his anointed, saying.”
Psa. 109:5.-The structure of this Psalm shows that the verb saying
must be supplied at the end of verse 5.

Α 1-5. David's prayer for himself: and complaint.

В 6-20. David's enemies’ words against him: (ending “that
speak evil against my soul.”)

А 21-28-. David's prayer for himself: and complaint.

В -28-31. David’s enemies’ acts against him: (ending “that
condemn his soul.”)

Here in B and B we have David’s enemies. In B (6-20) their words
and in В (-28-31) their acts. So that verses 6-20 are not David’s words
at all, but the words of David’s enemies, the evil which they speak
against his soul. The evil which they speak is contrasted with the
“good” which he prays for himself in the next verse (21). “Let them
curse,” he says in verse 28, “but bless Thou!” Let them say “let Satan
stand at his right hand” (verse 6); but he is assured (verse 31) that not
Satan but Jehovah shall “stand at the right hand of the poor to save
him from them that condemn his soul.”

Hence in verse 20 David prays, “Let this be the wages* [Note:
φτμῃ (peullah), wages, as in Lev. 19:13. Isa. 40:10; Isa. 49:4; Isa.
59:8; Isa. 52:11. Jer. 22:13.] of mine enemies from the Lord, and of
them that speak evil against my soul.”
So that verse 5 will now read:-
“And they have rewarded me evil for good,
And hatred for my good will [saying].”
Then the Psalm goes on (verses 6-19) to describe the “hatred.”
Having said in verses 2 and 3 that
“The mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened upon me.
They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
They compassed me about also with words of hatred,”
it is only natural to supply the verb saying at the end of verse 5.
Psa. 144:12 is similar. The structure shows that verses 12 to 15
contain the words of the “strange Children,” and not the words of
David.
А1 1-7. David's words (Thanksgiving and Prayer).
В1 8. The words of the strange children (vanity and
falsehood).

А2 9-11-. David's words (Thanksgiving and Prayer).

B2 -11-15-. The words of the strange children (vanity and
falsehood).

A3 -15. David’s words. The true conclusion as opposed to the

“vanity.”

The word say should be put in italics after the word “that” in verse
12, and then all the many italics inserted in verses 11-15 can be
dispensed with. It is clearly suggested in verses 8 and 11. So clearly
that there is hardly any necessity to use it or repeat it in verse 12. The
pronoun ALLL (asher), who, is clearer than “that.” Lit., “who [say].”
Then the Psalm (B.11-15-) goes on to give the vanity and the
falsehood as to what constitutes the true happiness of any people:-
Who say

“Our sons are as plants grown up in their youth;

Our daughters are as corner-stones, polished after the

similitude of a palace;

Our garners are full, affording all manner of store;

Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets;

Our oxen are strong to labour.

There is no breaking in nor going out.

There is no complaining in our streets.

Happy people that are in such a case!”
Then comes, in contrast, David's true estimate:

“NO! Happy is that people whose God is Jehovah.”

This is the truth as to real happiness, as is so beautifully declared
in Psa. 4:6-7 --

“There be many that say, Who will show us good?

Lord, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.

Thou hast put gladness in my heart,

More than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.”
Yes, this is the only real “good.” This is the only source of abiding
happiness and gladness for any People. It is not the increase of corn
and wine, but the light of God’s countenance; it is not the store which
men put in their garners, but it is the “gladness” which God puts in our
hearts. The structure of the whole Psalm agrees with this, and indeed
necessitates this interpretation.

So, in Psa. 146:6, happiness is declared to consist in having the
God of Jacob for our help, and our hope and help in the LORD our
God: for there is “no help” in man (verse 3).

Isa. 5:9.-“In mine ears said the Lord of hosts.”

Isa. 14:8.-“Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of
Lebanon, saying.”

Isa. 18:2.-“That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
bulrushes upon the waters, saying.”

Isa. 22:13.-“And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing
sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: [saying] Let us eat and drink;
for to-morrow we shall die.”

Isa. 24:14-15.-“They shall cry aloud from the sea, [saying],
Wherefore,” etc.
Isa. 28:9.-“Whom shall he teach knowledge?” etc.

That is, “Whom [say they] shall he teach knowledge?” This verse
and the following are the scornful words of “the scornful men”
mentioned in verse 14. They ridicule the words of the prophet, saying,
“for it is tsav upon tsav, tsav upon tsav, &c.,"* [Note: See under
Paronomasia.] not “must be” but “it is.”

Then, in verse 11, the prophet answers “For,” or “Yea, verily, with
stammerings of lip and another (or foreign) tongue will he speak to this
people,” and he tells them why “the word of the Lord was unto them
precept upon precept;” viz. (verse 13), that they might fall and be
broken.

Jer. 9:19.-“For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, [saying], How
are we spoiled!”

Jer. 11:19.-“I knew not that they had devised devices against me,
saying.”

Jer. 50:5.-“They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
saying.”

Lam. 3:41.-“Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the
heavens, [saying].”
Hos. 14:8.-“Ephraim shall say,” etc.
Act. 9:6.-“And the Lord said unto him,” etc.
Act. 10:15.-“And the voice spake unto him again the second time.”
Act. 14:22.-“Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them
to continue in the faith, and saying that we must through much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.”
2Co. 12:16.-“But be it so, | did not burden you: nevertheless [you say
that] being crafty, | caught you with guile.”

2. When the Infinitive of the verb is wanting:

(a) After the Hebrew vim γ8ΗΚόΗ able

Psa. 21:11.-“They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not
able to perform.”
Psa. 101:5.-“Him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not |
suffer,” i.e., | ат not able {ο bear.
Isa. 1:13.-“The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, |
cannot away with,” i.e., | am not able {ο endure. See Jer. 44:22.
Psa. 139:6.-“Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, |
cannot attain unto it.” Here the Ellipsis is properly supplied: i.e., | am
not able fo attain unto it.
Hos. 8:5.-“How long will it be ere they attain to innocency?” i.e., how
long ere they are able {ο practise innocency?
1Со. 3:2.-Ч have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
were not able to bear it,” i.e., to eat, or partake of it, or, to digest it.

(b) After the verb to finish
1Sa. 16:11.-“Are here all thy children?” Here the Ellipsis is avoided by
a free and idiomatic translation. The Heb. reads, “Have the young men
finished?” i.e., “Are the young men finished passing by?” or done
passing before me?
Mat. 10:23.-“Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son
of Man be come.” Lit. “Ye will not have finished going over the cities,”
etc., referring to verses 6 and 7.
Mat. 13:53.-“When Jesus had finished these parables,” i.e., when
Jesus had finished speaking these parables.
(c) When the INFINITIVE is wanting after another verb, personal
or impersonal

Gen. 9:20.-“And Noah began to be an husbandman,” or, “And Noah
the husbandman began and planted, etc.”
1Ki. 7:47.-“And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they
were exceeding many,” i.e., and Solomon omitted to weigh, etc.
Pro. 21:5.-“The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness:
but of every one that is hasty only to want.”

Here plenteousness is ОеЪШ (méthar) that which is over and
above, excess, (from ὕμιι (yahthar) to be superfluous).

“The thoughts of the diligent tend only to excess, and [the
thoughts] of every one that hasteth [fo get riches tend] only to want.”
The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies the Ellipses
thus. “But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want’; “hasting to
want’ is very obscure, but the “hasting to get riches” tending to want is
clear.

Mar. 15:8.-“And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do
as he had ever done unto them,” i.e., that he should do.

Luk. 13:33.-“Nevertheless | must walk to-day, and to-morrow, and the
day following,” etc.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “Howbeit | must
go on my way.” But the Greek is “Howbeit it behoves me to-day, and
to-morrow, and the day following, to go on [to work],” i.e., to continue
working.

Rom. 4:25.-“Who was delivered [to die] for our offences.”

3. When the Verb Substantive is omitted
The Hebrew having no verb substantive, this is generally expressed in
italics in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] But inasmuch as it is absolutely necessary for
the sense in English, the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has
printed it in roman type. (See preface to R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] );
Gen. 1:2.-“Darkness was upon the face of the deep.”
Gen. 2:10.-Lit. “And there was a river going out of Eden.”
Gen. 3:6.-“And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
and that it was pleasant to the eyes,” etc.
Gen. 4:13.-“My punishment is greater than | can bear.”
Gen. 5:1.-“This is the book of the generations of Adam.”
Num. 14:9.-“Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the
people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed
from them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.”
These are the words of Joshua and Caleb to the people to
encourage them to go up in spite of the false report of the other spies.
Note first the marginal rendering of the word “defence.” It is given
“Heb. shadow,” i.e., “Their shadow is departed.” So in the R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] the word “shadow’ is treated as though it
were a figure (Metonymy). The literal meaning of the word is departed
from, as well as the literal rendering of the preceding sentence. This is
On мдоре (kee lachmenoo) “for they are our bread.”

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, i.e., our bread
aptly represents their condition.
What was their “bread”? It was manna. What was the manna like?
It was most marvellous bread, for it was so hard that it had to be
ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar (Num. 11:8); and yet its
consistency was so peculiar that it melted in the sun! (Exo. 16:21). If it
were not gathered every morning before the sun arose and the
shadows departed, “when the sun waxed hot, it melted”!* [Note:
Marvellous bread indeed! A standing miracle, both as to the manner in
which it was given, and also as to its consistency. Bread indeed, hard,
and yet melting like ice in the sun.]

The wicked spies had just said (Num. 13:31) that Israel could not
go up against the people of the land, for they are “stronger than we”:
they were strong and hard. No, replies Joshua, it may be they are
strong, but so is our bread the manna-so strong that it needs grinding
and crushing, and yet, when the shadow goes from off it, it melts
away. Even so is it with them, as the words of Rahab testify (Jos.
2:11). The two spies whom Joshua afterwards sent heard the very
same truth from the lips of Rahab, which he, one of the two faithful
spies whom Moses had sent, forty years before declared. She tells
them:-“As soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of
you.”
Thus, while the literal signification of the words gives no sense,
they point to the true figure; and then, in turn, the figure explains the
literal signification of the words, and the true meaning of the passage.
So that we may render it thus:-“Only rebel not ye against Jehovah,
neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are like] our bread;
their shadow hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah is with us;
fear them not,” ᾖ8., as when the shadow turns aside from off our
bread, it melts away and disappears, so these enemies, hard and
strong as they might be, would surely melt away before the Lord God,
the Sun and the Shield of His people. In no sense could Jehovah be
the shadow or defence of the people of the land against whom Israel
was about to fight.
1Sa. 19:11.-“To-morrow thou shalt be slain.”
2Ki. 6:33.-“Behold, this evil is of the Lord.”
2Ch. 3:9.-“And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.”

The verb is omitted to show that the emphasis is on the “nails” and
their “weight.” And what a wonderful emphasis it is! For in all the
requirements for “the house of God,” the fir-trees, the fine gold, the
precious stones, the beams, the posts, the walls, etc., are mentioned;
yet, the “nails” that held all together are not omitted. Though they were
small, yet God used them: though out of sight, they were necessary.
Psa. 33:4.-“For the word of the Lord is right.”
Psa. 99:9.-“For the Lord our God is holy.”

It is worthy of note that there are three Psalms which begin with
the words: “The Lord reigneth,” viz., xciii., xcvii., and xcix. They each
end with a reference to holiness.

Psa. 93:1-5 “Holiness becometh Thine house, O Lord, for ever.”

Psa. 97:1-12 “Give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.”

Psa. 99:1-9 The third Psalm, three times:

Verse 3. “It is holy.”
Verse 5. “He is holy.”
Verse 9. “The Lord our God is holy.”
To those who have ears to hear, this plainly declares that when the
Lord shall reign, all will be holy; that when His kingdom comes, His
name will be hallowed on earth as it is in heaven. “In that day shall
there be upon the bells (or bridles) of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO
THE LORD; and the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls
before the altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be
HOLINESS unto the Lord of hosts” (Zec. 14:20-21). “Her merchandise
and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord” (Isa. 23:18).

The cry of the living creatures (Rev. 4:8, etc.) is “Holy, holy, holy,”
and their call is for the judgments which will issue in the Lord’s reign,
which is celebrated in these three Psalms. Those who teach that the
Cherubim (or the Cherubs) are the Church fail to see that their chief
function is to call for judgment!

Psa. 119:89.-“For ever, O Lord.” The verb must here be supplied. The
verb in the parallel line answers to the verb here:-

“For ever [art Thou] O Lord;

Thy word is settled in heaven.

Thy faithfulness is unto all generations;

Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.”
In the first and third lines, we have Jehovah. In the second and

fourth lines, we have what He has settled and established.

Ecc. 7:12.-“Wisdom is a defence.”

Isa. 43:25.-Ч, even |, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for
mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.”

We may take this in connection with Psa. 103:14. “For he knoweth
our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.”

Here the verbs are omitted to throw the emphasis on the persons,
rather than on the acts. This points us to Jehovah in the former
passage, and ourselves in the latter-His Deity, and our vanity-and to
contrast His thoughts with our thoughts, His ways with our ways. God
remembers our infirmities; but this is the very thing that man will not
remember! Man will make no allowance for our infirmities. On the
other hand, man will remember our sins. Let any one of us fall into sin,
and many will remember it after many years: but this is what God says
He will not remember! “Their sins and their iniquities will | remember
no more.” He is Jehovah, we are dust! Hence our sins, which man
remembers, God will forget; but our infirmities, which man forgets,
God will remember. Blessed be God!

Isa. 44:6.-“I am the first and | am the last, and beside me there is no
God.”
Eze. 34:17.-“And as for you.”

The Ellipses of this passage may be thus supplied: “And ye, O my
flock, thus saith the Lord God (Adonai Jehovah): Behold, | judge
between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. [/s if] a
small thing to you [goats] to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye
must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to
have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your
feet? And [is it a small thing that] my flock [i.e., my sheep] eat [or must
eat] that which ye [goats] have trodden with your feet; and drink that
which ye have fouled with your feet?”

The contrast is between the sheep and the goats. Sheep never
become goats, and goats never become sheep, either in nature or in
grace. The Chief Shepherd knows His sheep here; He separates them
now, and will eternally separate them from the goats in the coming
day, when He shall “save his flock, and judge between cattle and
cattle” (verses 20, 22, 23).
The characteristic of the goat alluded to here, is graphically set
forth in a paper read before the Victoria Institute, Feb. 1, 1892, by J.W.
Slater, Esq., F.C.S., F.E.S. He says, “The native flora and fauna of St.
Helena have been practically extirpated by the goat. These young
seedlings were browsed down as fast as they sprung up, and when
the old giants of the forest decayed there were no successors to take
their place. As a necessary consequence, the insects and birds
disappeared in turn. The same horned wretch’-fit type of evil-which, as
Sir Joseph Hooker shows, has ravaged the earth to a greater extent
than man has done by war, is now in the very same manner laying
waste South Africa. To such an extent has the mischief already been
carried, that a troop of the Colonial Cavalry on the march actually
gave three cheers on meeting a tree!”

Have we not here a fit illustration of Eze. 34:1-31? And may we not
see in ecclesiastical affairs around us (through the unfaithfulness of
the shepherds) the ravages of the “goats” in treading down and laying
waste, and fouling the pastures of the flock of God? The goats have
turned our churches and chapels into places of amusement and of
musical entertainment, where they may have “pleasant afternoons,”
and “make provision for the flesh”; so much so that the. Lord’s sheep
are “pushed” and “scattered,” and scarcely know where to find the
“green pastures” and the “living waters” of the pure Word of God and
the Gospel of His grace! Thank God, the Chief Shepherd is coming:
and, when He comes, though He will scarcely “find faith on the earth”
(Luk. 18:8), He will “save His flock” and separate them from the goats
for ever, and be their One True Shepherd.

Luk. 2:14.-“Glory to God in the highest,” i.e., Glory be to God in the
highest.

Luk. 22:21.-"The hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
table.”

Joh. 4:24.-“God is a Spirit.”

See under Hendiadys and Hyperbaton.

Act. 2:29.-“Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
patriarch David.”

Here the verb “speak” is the infinitive: /it., “to speak,” and “let me”
is the present participle (ἐξόν, exon),* [Note: €??? (exon) occurs only
three times, of these the first (Mat. 12:4) has ?? (een), was, after it;
while in the other two places (here, and 2Co. 12:4) it stands alone. In
2Co. 12:4 it seems plain that we must supply ¢???? (estin), is; and so
probably we should do here.] permitted or allowed. So that we must
supply the verb substantive (ἔστω, esto), let me be:-“[let me be]
permitted to speak freely unto you, or / am, or may be, permitted, etc.”
1Со. 6:13.-“Meats [are] for the belly, and the belly [/s] for meats.”
1Со. 15:29.-“Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,
if the dead rise not at all?”
This passage has been supposed to refer to a practice which
obtained even in those apostolic days of persons being baptized on
behalf of and for the spiritual benefit of those who were already dead.
As this practice thus receives a tacit approval, and yet is destitute of
any historical evidence as to its existence, apart from this passage,
various methods have been proposed of meeting the difficulty which is
thus raised. Some have erroneously suggested that “the dead” refers
to Christ: but they have done so in ignorance of the fact that the word
is plural, as is clearly shown by the verb “rise.” Others (with
Macknight) suggest the supply of the words “resurrection of’-“What
shall they do which are baptized for the [resurrection of] the dead?”
But this implies the omission of the very word which is most essential
to the argument; and would be a form of Ellipsis seldom, if ever, found.
There are a multitude of other explanations; but the true solution of the
difficulty is (we submit) to be sought in punctuation, and in the correct
supply of the Ellipsis.

We must bear in mind that there is no punctuation in the ancient
manuscripts, beyond the greater pauses. All interpunctuation is purely
human in its origin, and we may be thankful that it is so seldom
necessary to question its accuracy. We have also to note the structure
of the whole context, for this, like all other texts, must be interpreted in
harmony with the scope of the whole passage, and with the design of
the whole argument.
The following is the structure of 1Co. 15:12-58.* [Note: The first
eleven verses are constructed as follows:-
D 1-. The apostle’s declaration.
Е -1, 2. The Gospel he preached.
Р 3-. The apostle’s declaration.
Е 3-11. The Gospel he received.]
Α 12. The difficulty stated (as to the fact). “How?”
В 13-32. The difficulty met.
C 393,34. Practical application.
Α 35. The difficulty stated (as to the manner). “How?”
В 36-57. The difficulty met.
© 58. Practical application.
The structure of “B” (verses 13-32). The difficulty met.
В а — 13-18. Negative hypothesis and its consequences.
Ь — 19. Conclusion (positive) as to Christ’s in this life.
a 20-28. Positive assertion and its consequences.
Ь 29-32. Conclusion (negative) as to Christ's in this life.
The structure of “a” (verses 13-18). Negative hypothesis.
a ο 13. If no resurrection: Consequence-then Christ is not
risen.
Я — 14, 15. If Christ not risen.
Consequences:
Our preaching vain.
Your faith vain.
We false witnesses.
ο 16. If no resurrection: Consequence-then Christ is not
risen.
α 17, 18. If Christ not risen.
Consequences:
Your faith vain.
Ye yet in sins.
The dead perished.
The structure of “A” and “B” (verses 35-57). The difficulty stated.
A е 35. Question: How are the dead raised up?
f 395. Question: With what body do they come?
B # 36-49. Answer to “f.”
e 50-57. Answer to “e.”
The structure therefore of this chapter shows that verses 20-28
(“a”) are placed, practically, in a parenthesis, so that this 29th verse
reads on from the 19th verse, and continues the argument thus:-“17. If
Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 18.
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 19. If in
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
29. Else what shall they do which are being baptized?”* [Note: Alford
(who arrives at a very different conclusion) points out that
οἱ βαπιζόµενοι (hoi baptizomenci) is the present participle and not the
past, i.e., those who are being baptized. He observes: “The distinction
is important as affecting the interpretation.”]

But here comes in the matter of punctuation. In. Rom. 8:34 we
have a very similar construction, which, if we treat it as 1Co. 15:29 is
treated in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
, would read thus, “Who is he that condemneth Christ that died?” But
the question is made to end at the word “condemneth,” and the
Ellipsis of the verb substantive is supplied thus:-“Who is he that
condemneth? /t is Christ that died” (or better, “/s it Christ who died?”
See below). Now if we treat 1Co. 15:29 in the same manner, it will
read, “What shall they do which are being baptized? /t is on behalf of
the dead if the dead rise not at all!”
From Rom. 6:1-23 we learn that our circumcision is in Christ's
death, our baptism is in Christ's burial. “Buried with Him by the
baptism of Him, (i.e., by His baptism-unto-death)’; and if He is not
raised, we cannot be raised, Rom. 6:4. (See above, pages 18, 19).
“Buried with Him in the baptism of him,” i.e., His baptism (Col.
2:11-12).

Therefore if Christ be not raised, we are not raised in Him, and our
baptism is for the dead.

Whenever we have the word νεκρός (nekros), dead, with the
article (as it is here in 1Co. 15:29), it always denotes dead bodies,
corpses. (See Gen. 23:3-6; Gen. 23:8; Gen. 23:13; Gen. 23:15. Deu.
28:26. Jer. 12:33. Eze. 37:19. Luk. 24:5.) On the contrary, when it is
without the article it denotes the persons who are dead, dead people.
(See Deu. 14:1. Mat. 22:33. Mar. 9:10. Luk. 16:30-31; Luk. 24:46. Joh.
20:9. Act. 10:41; Act. 26:23. Rom. 6:13; Rom. 10:7; Rom. 11:15. Heb.
11:19; Heb. 13:20).

So that this is an additional argument why, if Christ be not raised,
and we are buried with Him, then baptism is in the interest of those
who are to remain dead corpses, and not of risen ones, raised with
Christ.
This is the force of the word ὑπέρ (hyper). Like the English “for,” it
denotes the object of interest, not merely the subject, and ranges from
mere reference to actual substitution, e.g., 2Co. 8:23, “Whether any
enquire about Titus”; Mat. 5:44, “Pray for those who persecute you”;
Mar. 9:40, “He who is not against us is for us”; 2Co. 1:6, “Whether we
be afflicted, it is for your consolation”; Philem. 13, “That he might
minister to me instead of thee.”* [Note: See also Rom. 9:27. 20ο.
1:11; 2Co. 8:23-24. 2Th. 2:1. Col. 1:7.]

If Christ be not raised, well may those who are being baptized into
Christ's burial be asked, “What shall they do?” Truly, “Е is for the
dead.” For they will remain dead, as corpses. In this life they “die
daily” (verse 31); in death they perish (verse 18); and are thus “of all
men most miserable” (verse 19).
“What shall they do who are being baptized? /t is for the dead if
the dead rise not at all!” It is to remain dead, as corpses, without hope
of resurrection.

Thus, the expression, “baptized for the dead,” vanishes from the
Scripture, and is banished from theology; for the assumed practice is
gathered only from this passage, and is unknown to history apart from
it.
1Co. 15:48.-“As is the earthy [man, Adam] such [shall be] also they
that are earthy; and as is the heavenly [man, the Lord] such [shall be]
they also that are heavenly.”

This is clear from the verse that follows:-“And as we have borne
the image of the earthy [man, Adam] we shall also bear the image of
the heavenly [man, the Lord].” See Php. 3:21.

2Co. 11:22.-“Are they Hebrews? So am,” etc.

Eph. 3:1.-“For this cause | Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
Gentiles,” {6., “I Paul [am] the prisoner,” etc.

Php. 4:16.-“For even [when / was] in Thessalonica ye sent once and
again unto my necessity.”
2Ti. 3:16.-“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable.”t [Note: See this passage also under the figures of
Asyndeton and Paregmenon.]

With this we may take eight other passages, where we have the
same construction: viz., Rom. 7:12. 1Co. 11:30. 2Co. 10:10. 1Ti. 1:15;
1Ti. 2:3; 1Ti. 4:4; 1Ti. 4:9. and Heb. 4:13.

These nine passages may be taken together, and considered in
their bearing on the translation of 2Ti. 3:16 in the Revised Version,
which is as follows:-

“Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable,” etc.

In each of these passages we have the very same Greek
construction, and four of them are in the Epistles to Timothy. The A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] translates all these nine passages in precisely the same way,
and on the same principles. But the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] translates eight of them in one way ({6., like the A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ),
while it renders one on quite a different principle.

Here are the passages, and the rendering as in the Authorized
Version:-
Rom. 7:12.

ἡ ἐντολὴ The commandment
is

ayia holy

kal and

бикайа just.
1Co. 11:30.
πολλοϊ many
are

ἀσθενεῖς weak
kal and
ἄῤῥωστοι sickly.
2Co. 10:10.
ἐπιστολαί his letters
are

βαρεῖαι weighty
kal and

ioxupai powerful.
1Ti. 1:15; 1Ti. 4:9.
πιστὸς faithful

is

ὁ λόγος the saying
kal and
πάσης ἁποδοχῆς ἄξιος worthy of all acceptation.
(Ti. 2:3.

τοῦτο this

is

καλόν good

kal and

ἀπόδεκτον acceptable.

1Ti. 4:4.

πᾶν κῄσµα Θεου Every creature of God
is

καλόν good

kal and
οὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον nothing to be refused.
2Ti. 3:16.

πᾶσα γραφὴ All Scripture

is

Θεόπνευστος given by inspiration of God
kal and

ὠφέλιμος is profitable.

Heb. 4:13.

πάντα All things

are

γυμνὰ naked

kal and
τετραχηλισµένα Opened.

Now the case stands thus. The Revisers have translated eight of
these passages, which we have cited, on the same principles as the
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , ie., supplying in italics the verb substantive “is” and
“are” respectively, and taking the copulative kai, “and,” as joining
together the two predicates. But when the Revisers come to the ninth
passage (2Ti. 3:16), they separate the two conjoined predicates,
making the first a part of the subject, and then are obliged to translate
the kai in the sense of “also,” when there is nothing antecedent to it.
Thus:-

“Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable.”
Now, if the Revisers had translated the other eight passages in the
same way, the renderings would have been consistent, whatever else
they might not have been.

Rom. 7:12 would have been-

“The holy commandment is also just.”
1Co. 11:30 would have been-

“Many weak ones are also sickly.”
2Co. 10:10 would have been-

“His weighty letters are also powerful.”

1Ti. 1:15; 1Ti. 4:9 would have been-

“The faithful saying is also worthy of all acceptation.”
1Ti. 2:3 would have been-

“This good thing is also acceptable.”
1Ti. 4:4 would have been-
“Every good creature of God {5 also nothing to be refused.”

Heb. 4:13 would have been-

“All naked things are also opened,” etc.

But the Revisers do not translate them thus! And the fact that they
render the whole of these eight passages as in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ and
single out 2Ti. 3:16 for different treatment, forbids us to accept the
inconsistent rendering, and deprives it of all authority. Without
inquiring as to what the motives of the Revisers may have been, we
are justified in regretting that this should be the passage singled out
for this inconsistent and exceptional treatment, reducing it to a mere
platitude. It is only fair to add that the correct rendering of the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] is given in the margin.

Philem. 11.-“Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now [is]
profitable to thee and to me.”
4. When the Participle is wanting
Num. 24:19.-” Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] is more literal:-“And
out of Jacob shall one have dominion.”

The Heb. is simply:-“And one shall rule (or have dominion) out of
Jacob.”

The Ellipsis of the participle being supplied, it reads:-“And one
shall rule [being born] out of Jacob.”
1Sa. 15:7.-“And Saul smote the Amalekites [dwelling] from Havilah
unto Shur.”

This refers to the region occupied by the Amalekites, and not to
the people smitten, as is clear from chap. 30.
Isa. 57:8.-“Thou hast discovered thyself to another than me,” i.e.,
“thou hast discovered thyself, departing from me,” oabi (meittee).
Eze. 11:11.-‘This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
flesh in the midst thereof; but | will judge you [scattered] in the border
of Israel.”
Mar. 7:4.-“And [on coming] from the market, they eat not except they
wash.”
Mar. 7:17.-“And when he was entered into the house [getting away]
from the people.”
Act. 13:20.-“And after that he gave unto them judges about the space
of 450 years.” Lit., “After these things [were done],” i.e., after the
division of the land by Joshua.* [Note: For the question as to the
Chronology involved in this difficulty, see Number in Scripture, by the
same author and publisher, page 5.]
2Th. 1:9.-“Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [driven
out] from the presence of the Lord.”
Heb. 2:3.-“Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
confirmed unto us by them that heard him,” i.e., “which at the first
began to be spoken by the Lord, and, [being brought] unto us by them
that heard him, was confirmed,” etc.

Ill. When Certain Connected Words are omitted in the same

Member of a Passage
This particular form of Ellipsis has a distinct name, BRACHYLOGIA
(BpaxuAoyia from βραχύς, brachus, short, and λόγος, logos,
discourse), English, Bra-chyl-o-gy. Or from the Latin,
BRE VILOQUENCE, it means brevity of speech or writing, and is
used of an Ellipsis, in which words are omitted chiefly for the sake of
brevity; which words may easily be supplied from the nature of the
subject.

Gen. 25:32.-“And Esau said, Behold, | am at the point to die; and what
profit shall this birthright do to me?” There must be supplied, the
thought, if not the words:-“I will sell it.” So with the next verse. “And
Jacob said, Swear to me this day [that thou wilt sell it me]; and he
sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.”

Gen. 45:12.-“And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.” Lit., it is,
“because my mouth σὐοφή, kee phee) is speaking unto you.” If
we supply the Ellipsis, we may retain this literal rendering.

Joseph had been speaking of his glory (verse 8): but, on the
principle of Pro. 27:2 : “Let another man praise thee, and not thine
own mouth,” he breaks off and says, “Now, behold, your eyes are
seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin; because my own mouth
is speaking unto you [/ cannot speak of all my glory], but ye shall
declare to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all that ye have seen,”
i.e., They were to describe what he could not well say of himself.

2Ki. 19:9.-“And when he had heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: [he turned his army
against him; and, having conquered him, he returned to Jerusalem,
and] he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah.”

2Ki. 22:18.-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As touching the words
which thou hast heard.”

So the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] but without italics.
But surely the sense is:-“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The words
which thou (Josiah) hast heard [shall surely come to pass, buf]
because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself,” etc.
... ‘thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
shall not see all the evil which | will bring upon this place.”
1Ch. 18:10.-“He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against
Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and
with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies “and he had
with him.” But the Ellipsis is to be supplied from 2Sa. 8:10, thus, “And
all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass were in his hand”
(ήτο Πὔε).
Eze. 47:13.-“Joseph shall have two portions,” i.e., shall inherit.
Mat. 21:22.-“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
ye shall receive,” i.e., add “if it be His will.” Compare Mat. 26:39-44;
Jos. 5:14-15; 1Jn. 5:14-15. This is the one abiding condition of all real
prayer, and the Ellipsis must be thus supplied wherever it is found.
In Mar. 5:1-43 we have by way of illustration three prayers-
1. In verses 12, 13. “The devils besought him,” and “Jesus gave
them leave.”
2. In verse 17. The Gadarenes “began to pray him to depart out
of their coasts.” And Jesus left them.
3. In verses 18, 19. “He that had been possessed with the devil
prayed him that he might be with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered
him not.”
“No!” is an answer to prayer | and often, very often, a most
gracious and loving answer too. No greater calamity could come upon
us than for God to answer “Yes” to all our ignorant requests. Better to
have our prayers refused with this man who had been the subject of
His grace and love and power, than to have them answered with
Devils and Gadarenes.

Mat. 25:9.-“But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
enough for us and you;” i.e., “But the wise answered, By no means,
for look, there will not be enough, &c., or we cannot give to you, lest,
&с.”

Mar. 14:49.-“But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.” The Greek is, “But
that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] correctly supplies the Ellipsis, “But this is done that
the Scriptures should be fulfilled.” (Compare Mat. 26:56.)

Luk. 7:43.-“Simon answered and said, | suppose that he to whom he
forgave most [will love him mosf].”

Joh. 2:18.-“What sign showest thou unto us [that thou art the
Messiah], seeing that thou doest these things?” As in Jdg. 6:17,
Gideon says, “Show me a sign that thou [art Jehovah that] talkest with
me.”
Joh. 7:38.-“He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of
his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”

The difficulties of this verse are great, as may be seen by a
reference to the commentators. It will be noted that a comparison is
suggested by the word καθώς (kathds), like as, and that there is an
Ellipsis which must be supplied. Bengel suggests “as the Scripture
hath said so it shall be,” or “so shall it be.” But something more is
evidently required. Is there not a reference to the Haphtarah, i.e., the
portion selected (from the Prophets) as the lesson to be read on the
first day of the Feast of Tabernacles, which was Zec. 14:1-21?* [Note:
The portion from the Law (Act. 13:15) read in conjunction with this was
Lev. 22:26-33; Lev. 23:1-44; with Num. 29:12-16.] The Lord was not
present then, for it was not until “the midst of the feast” that He went
up (verse 14). But in “the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
stood and cried,” with evident reference to the Scripture which had
been read, “He that believeth on me (as the Scripture hath said
[concerning Jerusalem: so shall it be]) out of his heart rivers of living
water shall flow.” What the Scripture had said concerning Jerusalem in
Zec. 14:8 was this:-“And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall
go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of
them toward the hinder sea,” &c. To this agree the words of the
prophecy in Eze. 47:1-11. These prophecies shall yet be literally
fulfilled with regard to Jerusalem: and what will then actually take place
illustrates what takes place now in the experience of every one who
believes in Jesus. Even as those rivers will flow forth from Jerusalem
in that day, so now the Holy Spirit, in all His wondrous powers, and
gifts, and graces, flows forth from the inward parts-the new nature of
the believer.

Joh. 13:18.-“I speak not of you all: | know whom | have chosen: but [/
have done this] that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth
bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.” Compare verses
26-30.
Joh. 15:25.-“But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled
that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.” The
abbreviated expression emphasizes the statement to which we are
thus hastened on. And our attention is called to the fact that δωρεάν
(абгеап) here rendered “without a cause” is in Rom. 3:24 rendered
“freely.”-“Being justified freely by his grace”: /.е., there was no more
cause why we should be “justified” than there was why Jesus should
be “hated”!

Joh. 15:27.-“Ye have been with me from the beginning [and are still
with me].” Compare 16:4, and see 1Jn. 3:8 below.

Rom. 9:16.-Here the reference is to Esau and Jacob, spoken of in
verses 10-13, and to the history as recorded in Gen. 27:3-4.

“So then [election is] not of him who willeth [as /заас wished to
bless Esau according to “the will of the flesh’* [Note: As Jacob was
asked to bless Ephraim and Manasseh according to “the will of man”
(Joseph) (Gen. 48:7-14). Both cases are instanced in Heb. 11:20-21
as acts of “Faith,” i.e., faith’s exercise of gifts contrary to “the will of the
flesh,” as in the case of Isaac; and contrary to “the will of man” in the
case of Jacob.] ], nor of him that runneth [as Esau ran for venison that
his father might eat, and bless him], but of God who showeth mercy.”
1Co. 9:4.-“Have we not power to eat and to drink [at the expense of
our converts or of the Church]?” Without this there is no sequence in
the apostle’s argument. Or we may supply [without working with our
own hands], see verses 6 and 7.
20ο. 5:3.-“If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.”

Here the blessed hope of Resurrection is described as being
clothed upon with the heavenly body. This is the subject which
commences at 2Co. 4:14. In chap. 5:3 the kai is ignored in both A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] The Greek is, “If
indeed BEING CLOTHED also, we shall not be found naked [as some
among you say].” There were some among the Corinthians who said
“there is no resurrection of the dead” (1Co. 15:12; 1Co. 15:35), and
here those assertions are thus referred to.
Gal. 2:9.-“They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
fellowship; that we unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision,
[should carry the apostolic message and decrees].”
Eph. 4:29.-Here the word εἰ (ei) if is omitted in the translation both in
the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] Not
observing the Ellipsis, the word “if? was omitted to make sense.

With the “if” retained, the Ellipsis is properly supplied thus:-
“Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but, if
any [speech be] good to the use of edifying, [/et it be spoken] that it
may minister grace unto the hearers.”

Php. 4:11.-“I have learned in whatsoever state | am, therewith to be
content.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads “therein to be
content,” without italics. But what is he to be content with? Surely not
content with the circumstances, but with the will of God. So that the
verse will read, “I have learned, in whatsoever state | am, to be
content with [the will of Goa].”
1Jn. 3:8.-“The devil sinneth from the beginning [and still sinneth].”

IV. When a Whole Clause is omitted in a Connected Passage

1. When the first member of a clause is omitted
Mat. 16:7.-“And they reasoned among themselves, saying, /t is
because we have taken no bread.”
Here the first member of the latter clause is wanting. It is supplied
in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] by the words “It is.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , not seeing this Ellipsis, has boldly omitted the oti
(hoti) because, and_ translated:-“And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, We took no bread” (giving the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in the
margin).

The Ellipsis of the first member is properly filled up thus:-“And they
reasoned among themselves, saying [Jesus spoke thus, verse 6],
because we have taken no bread.”

See further under Hypocatastasis.

Mar. 3:30.-“Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.” Here the
first clause is omitted:-“[Jesus said this unto them], because they said,
He hath an unclean spirit.”

Luk. 9:13.-“He said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said,
We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go
and buy meat for all this people.”

There is something wanting here, which may be thus
supplied:-“We have no more than five loaves and two fishes;
[therefore we are not able to give to them to eat] except we should go
and buy meat for all this people.”

Joh. 5:7.-“The impotent man answered him, Sir, [/ am indeed willing,
but], | have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the
pool,” etc.

2Th. 2:3.-“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall
not come, except there come a falling away first.” (Lit., the apostasy.)
The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] fills up the Ellipsis of the
prior member, by the words “it will not be,” which is weak and tame
compared with the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.]

What is referred to is the day of the Lord,* [Note: Not “the day of
Christ,” as in A.V. The R.V. and the Ancient mss. and Critical Texts
read correctly “the day of the Lord.”] mentioned in the preceding
verse. “Let no man deceive you by any means: for [the day of the Lord
shall not come] except there come the falling away first:” i.e., the great
apostasy, which is the subject of many prophecies, must precede the
day of the Lord. But it does not precede the day of Christ. Hence the
saints in Thessalonica might well be troubled if the day of the Lord had
set in, and they had not been previously gathered together to meet the
Lord in the air in the day of Christ, as had been promised (1Th.
4:16-17; 2Th. 2:1).¢ [Note: See Four Prophetic Periods, by the same
author and publisher.]

This is not the popular teaching, but it is the truth of God. Popular
theology is very different. It says, “That day cannot come until the
world’s conversion comes.” The Scripture says it cannot come until
the apostasy shall have come. Popular theology says the world is not
good enough yet for Christ to come. The Scripture teaches that the
world is not yet bad enough! The Thessalonian saints believed their
teachers, and are an example for all time for holiness of walk and for
missionary zeal. People to-day believe their teachers, and all men see
their works!

2. The Ellipsis of a latter clause, called Anantapodoton, i.e.,

without apodosis*

[Note: Apodosis, Greek a???????, a giving back again: hence, it is
the consequent clause. The former clause is called the Protasis
(22222222, to stretch before).]

It is a hypothetical proposition without the consequent clause.
Gen. 30:27.-“And Laban said unto him, | pray thee, if | have found
favour in thine eyes [remain with me: for] | have learned by experience
that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.”
2Sa. 2:27.-“And Joab said [to Abner], As God liveth, unless thou hadst
spoken [the words which gave the provocation (see verse 14)], surely
then in the morning the people had gone up (marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] gone away) every one from following his brother.”
2Sa. 5:6-8.-The Ellipsis here involves a retranslation of this difficult
passage:-“And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, unto the
Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: Which spake unto David,
saying,t [Note: Both the A.V. and the Π.Ν. transpose the following two
sentences.] Thou shalt not come in hither, for (or but, nn aH, kee
eem, see Psa. 1:3-4; ‘for, Pro. 23:18; Lam. 5:22) the blind and lame
shall drive thee away (so Coverdale) by saying (МаОШ, /aimér,
saying, margin), David shall not come in hither. Nevertheless, David
took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. And David
said on that day, Whosoever getteth up by the Tsinnor,t [Note:
Ounew (batsinnor) in, or by the Tsinnor, which was an
underground watercourse, recently discovered by Sir Charles Warren.
See his Recovery of Jerusalem, pp. 107, 109, 124.] and smiteth the
Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, who hate David’s soul (Π.Ν.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin); he shall be chief or
captain, because they (the blind and the lame) had said, He shall not
come into the house (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin),” or citadel.

The Ellipsis is supplied from 1Ch. 11:6; and thus, with one or two
simple emendations, the whole passage is made clear.

It would seem that the citadel was so strong that the Jebusites put
their blind and lame there, who defended it by merely crying out,
“David shall not come in hither.”

Mat. 6:25.-“Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
[and if God vouchsafes the greater, how much more that which is
less].”

Mat. 8:9.-“For | am a man under authority, having soldiers under me:
and | say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it [how much
more art Thou, who art God, able to command, or to speak the word
only that my servant may recover).”

Mar. 11:32.-“But if we shall say, Of men: [what will happen to us?] for,
they feared the people.” Or we may supply, “it will not be wise.”
Luk. 2:21.-“And when eight days were accomplished for the
circumcising of the child [then they circumcised him, and] his name
was called JESUS.”

Joh. 3:2.-“Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for
no man can do these miracles which thou doest, except God be with
him: [therefore am | come to thee, that thou mayest teach me the way
of salvation].”

Joh. 6:62.-“What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where
he was before?”

Here the Apodosis is entirely wanting. The Greek reads simply “If
then ye should see the Son of man ascending up where he was
before?” The thought is the same as in Joh. 3:12 : “If | have told you
earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if | tell you of
heavenly things?” So that the apodosis may be supplied thus, “will ye
believe then?” or, “ye will not be offended then,” i.e., ye will marvel
then not at My doctrine but at your own unbelief of it. Compare 8:28
and 3:13. (But see further under the figure of Aposiopesis).
Rom. 9:22-24.-Here we have a remarkable anantapodoton. The
conclusion of the argument is omitted. It begins with “if (verse 22),
and the apodosis must be supplied at the end of verse 24 from verse
20, i.e., if God chooses to do this or that “who art thou that repliest
against God?” What have you to say?

Or, indeed, we may treat it as the Ellipsis of a prior member, in
which case verse 22 would commence “[what reply hast thou to
make], if God, willing to show his wrath,” etc.

Jam. 2:13.-“For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath
showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment [to him that
hath showed mercy].”

2Pe. 2:4.-The apodosis is wanting here, but it is difficult to supply it
without breaking the argument; which is, “If God spared not the angels
that sinned,” neither will he spare the false prophets and teachers,
mentioned in verse 1.

It is deferred till verse 12, where we have it:-they “shall utterly
perish in their own corruption.”

3. When the Comparison is wanting. This is a kind of
anantapodoton
Rom. 7:3.-In verses 2 and 3 the hypothesis is given in which the
husband dies, while in verse 4 the fact to be illustrated is the case in
which the wife dies. Death ending the power of the marriage-law in
each case.

At the end of verse 3, therefore, the other hypothesis must be
supplied (mentally if not actually):-

“If her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is
no adulteress, though she be married to another man [and | need not
say that if she be dead, she is, of course, free from that law].
Wherefore, my brethren, ye also have died to the law through the
body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who is
raised from the dead,” {6., God’s people have died in Christ; and, on
the other side of death, have risen with Christ, and are united to Him.
Thus being dead with Christ, the Law has no longer any dominion
over them, and they are free to be united to another, “being dead to
that wherein we were held” (verse 6, margin, and, R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] ). Compare the following Scriptures on this
important doctrine:- Rom. 8:2; Rom. 6:1-11; Gal. 2:19; Gal. 5:18; Gal.
6:14; Col. 2:14; Col. 3:3; 1Pe. 2:24. This figure comes under the head
of Rhetoric, and is then called Enthymema (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ).
1Ti. 1:3-4.-“As | besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when | went
into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
other doctrine, Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,
which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith
[so ! repeat my charge, that thou remain at Ephesus, etc.]”
2Ti. 2:20.-“In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth, and, some to honour; and some
to dishonour: [so in the great house of the church there are not only
the elect saints, which are the vessels of honour, but there are the
impious and reprobate, who are the vessels of dishonour].” Therefore
the admonition follows, in verse 21, to purge ourselves from these;
i.e., not from the vessels of gold and silver, or wood and earth, but
from persons. Still less does it say we are to purge the persons or the
assembly! Each one is to “purge himself,” not the others.

We now come to the second great division.

B. Relative Ellipsis:

Where the omitted word must be supplied from the words actually
related to it and employed in the context itself.
|. Where the omitted Word is supplied from a COGNATE Word
occurring in the Immediate Context
1. Where the Noun is suggested by the Verb
Lev. 4:2.-‘If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the
commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be
done.”

Here the verb “shall sin” supplies the noun “sins,” i.e., “concerning
sins which ought not to be done.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] evades the difficulty
by a freer translation. But the correct supply of the Ellipsis enables us
to retain the literal translation.

Num. 11:14.-“I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
too heavy for me.”

Here the noun is latent in the verb, and is naturally supplied by it
thus:-“I am not able to bear the burden of all this people alone,
because it is too heavy for me.” The word “it” does not refer to the
People, but to the burden of them.

In verse 17 it is translated fully.
2Ki. 17:14.-“Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their
necks, like to the neck of their fathers,” i.e., like to the hardness of the
necks of their fathers.
Psa. 13:3 (4).-“Lighten mine eyes, lest | sleep the death,” {6., the
sleep of death.
Psa. 76:11.-“Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God,” i.e., pay your
vows.
Psa. 107:41.-“And maketh him families like a flock.”

Lit., maketh like a flock the families.

The two parallel lines are thus completed by supplying the
Ellipsis:-

“Yet setteth he the poor on high from (or, after) affliction,

And maketh like a flock the families [of the afflicted].”
Hos. 9:4.-“They shall not offer wine to the Lord,” i.e., wine offerings.
As in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.]
Gal. 4:24.-“Which things are an allegory: for these [two women] are
the two covenants; the one, indeed, from the mount Sinai, which
bringeth forth [children] into bondage, which is Hagar.” The apodosis
or conclusion is suspended till verse 26. “But Jerusalem which is
above is the free [woman], who is the mother of us all.” In verse 25, it
must be noted that the word “this” is the article τό, which is neuter,
while “Hagar” is feminine. Τό, therefore, must agree with some neuter
word, which must be supplied, such as ὄνομα (onoma) name:-“For
this [name] Hagar is (or, denotes) Mount Sinai in Arabia.” It is a fact
that in Arabia the word Hagar (which means a stone) is the name for
Mount Sinai.
2. Where the Verb is to be supplied from the Noun

1Sa. 13:8.-“And he tarried seven days, according to the time that
Samuel [had appointed].”
1Ch. 17:18.-“What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
servant?” i.e., the honour put upon thy servant.
Psa. 94:10.-“He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he
that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?”

Compare verse 9, where we have similar questions.
Hos. 1:2.-“Go, take thee a wife of whoredoms and children of
whoredoms.”

The sense, as we see from verses 3, 6, and 8, must be “and
[bege?] children,” etc.
Mic. 7:3.-“The prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward.”

Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] supplies the Ellipsis by repeating the previous
verb. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] supplies it with the
verb “is ready,” i.e., “the judge is ready for a reward.”

But the verb is latent in the noun (“judge”) and is to be supplied
from it, thus:-

“The prince asketh, and the judge judgeth for a reward.”

The subject of the former sentence must be supplied from the
latter, and then the two lines will read thus:-

“The prince asketh for [a reward],
And the judge [judgeth] for a reward.”
Rom. 12:6-8.-“Having then gifts differing according to the grace given
to us, whether prophecy, /et us prophesy according to the proportion
of the faith [given or dealt to us, verse 3].” The verbs must also be
supplied in the following, exhortations:-“Or ministry, [/et us be diligent]
in the ministry: or he that teacheth, [/et him be faithful] in teaching; or
he who exhorteth, [/et him employ himself] in exhortation: he Who
distributeth, [/et him distribute] with simplicity; he who presideth, [εί
him preside] with care; he that showeth mercy, [/et him show if] with
cheerfulness.”

In the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,
some are supplied and some are not.

Rom. 13:7.-“Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute
is due, etc.”

Here the verb {ο be due is latent in the noun dues.
1Co. 1:26.-“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.”

Here the thought or subject is the “calling’-the act of calling, i.e.,
not the persons who are called, but the persons who call. The
following verses go on to explain the manner in which God calls: viz.,
by choosing the weak and the base to confound the wise and the
mighty. So in like manner He had chosen weak instruments like Paul,
Apollos and Cephas to call the saints in Corinth, and to produce such
wondrous results, in order “that no flesh should glory in His presence.”
The Ellipsis would in this case be better supplied thus:-“Not many
wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble call you.”
2Co. 5:17.-“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.”
Here the verb substantive is supplied twice, but the verb created
must be supplied from the noun “creature”:-“If any man be in Christ,
[he is created] a new creature.”
Or else there is only one Ellipsis, and the sentence reads on, thus:
“If any man be in Christ a new creation, old things have passed away;
behold, all things are become new.”
Eph. 3:16.-‘[Praying] that he would grant you,” from “bowing my
knees” in verse 14.
Il. Where the omitted Word is to be supplied from a CONTRARY
Word
Gen. 33:10.-“And Jacob [refused and] said, etc.”
This word is latent in the contrary words which follow.

Gen. 33:15.-“And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the
folk that are with me. And he [Jacob] said, What needeth it? [Thou
shalt not leave any],” etc.

Gen. 49:4.-“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.”

R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.]
, ‘Bubbling over as water, thou shalt not have the excellency.”

The word rendered “unstable” is φβλς (pachaz), to bubble up and
overflow, to flow down like water. (So Sam. and Syr.). The Ellipsis is
supplied from the contrary words, “Flowing down like water [it shall
pass away), thou shalt not have the excellency.”

This follows on verse 3. “Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might,
and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the
excellency of power, with rapidity, like water, [all this shall pass away],
thou shalt not have the excellency!”

And so it came to pass. See 1Ch. 5:1.

Jdg. 5:6.-Here, because the Ellipsis has not been observed, liberties
have been taken in the translation. The Heb. is literally “In the days of
Jael the high-ways ceased” (as in verse 7).
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
both render, “The high-ways were unoccupied.” The R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] tries to preserve the correctness of
translation by giving in the margin “the caravans ceased.”

But the Ellipsis when supplied by the contrary words which follow
makes all clear:-“In the days of Jael, the highways ceased [fo be safe],
and the travellers walked through by-ways.”

Psa. 7:11.-“God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the
wicked every day.”
Psa. 65:8.-“Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and of the
evening to rejoice.”

This does not mean the outgoings of the evening as well as the
morning. The contrary word must be supplied, viz., “[the incomings or
return] of the evening.”

Psa. 66:20.-“Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer,
nor his mercy from me.” This is not “my prayer from me,” but “my
prayer [from himself].”

Psa. 84:10.-“For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand
[elsewhere, or in any other place].”
Pro. 19:1.-“Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [the
rich, that is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.”

Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] has supplied “he that is.” It is necessary merely
to define the person as rich to complete the contrast which is clearly
implied.

Pro. 24:17-18.-“Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine
heart be glad when he stumbleth: lest the Lord see it, and it displease
him, and he turn away his wrath from him [to thee].”

Without the supply of this Ellipsis “to thee,” there is no sense in the
words.

Pro. 28:16.-“The prince that lacketh understanding [and] also a great
oppressor [shall cut off his days], but he that hateth covetousness,
shall prolong his days.”

Jer. 18:15.-“My people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense
to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways [so that
they forsake] the ancient paths,” etc.

Dan. 3:15.-Here the Ellipsis is so patent that it is supplied. “Now if ye
be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down
and worship the image which | have made; [well and good].” Compare
Luk. 13:9.

Luk. 13:9.-“And if it bear fruit, wel/; and if not, then, after that thou
shalt cut it down.”

Here the omitted verb is suggested by the contrary verb that is
given. Thus: “If it bear fruit [hou shalt leave it to stand, or shalt not cut
it down], and if not, after that, thou shalt cut it down.”

See further under the figure of Aposiopesis.

Rom. 6:17.-“But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but
ye have obeyed,” etc.

Here the word δέ (de), but, in the latter clause implies and points
us to the word μέν (men) which is omitted in the former clause. The
two go together in a sentence of this character, and the employment of
the one reveals the omission of the other. It should be rendered:-“But
God be thanked that [a/though] ye were the servants of sin, yet ye
have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered
unto you.”
This is clearly the sense, for we are not to thank God that we were
the servants of sin, but that, though we were, we are so no longer.*
[Note: For the importance of this word μέν (men), although, compare
1Ре. 4:6, where both the A.V. and Π.Ν. ignore it, though it is there in
the Greek, thus translating the words:-“For this cause was the gospel
preached to them that are dead also, that they might be judged
according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.”
Surely, it cannot be that the gospel was preached in order that men
might be judged! And it is unaccountable why the A.V. and R.V. should
both altogether ignore the important word μέν (men), although, and
leave it untranslated!

They have both created an Ellipsis in the English, though there is
none in the Greek, which reads iva κριθῶσι μέν (hina krithosi men), “in
order that, though they might be condemned according to the will of
mena as to the flesh, yet they might live (ζῶσι δὲ, 2651 de) according
to the will of God, as to the spirit.” That is to say, the gospel was
preached to those who had since died, not “that they might be judged”
thus, but “that THOUGH they might be judged.” (See a pamphlet on
The Spirits in Prison, by the same author and publisher.)]
1Co. 7:19.-“Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but the keeping of the commandments of God [is everything],” i.e.,
alone avails.
2Co. 8:14.-“But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance
may be a supply for their want, that [at another time] their abundance
also may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality.”
1Ti. 4:3.-“Forbidding to marry [and commanding] to abstain from
meats.” (See under Zeugma.)
Ill. Where the omitted Word is to be supplied from ANALOGOUS,
or RELATED Words

Gen. 50:23.-“The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were
brought up upon Joseph’s knees.” Margin, borne. R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] , born.

But the Ellipsis of relation is:-“[and educated] at Joseph's knees.”
Exo. 13:15.-“Therefore | sacrifice to the Lord all [beasts],” etc.
Lev. 21:4.-“But he being a chief man [a priest] among his people, shall
not defile himself [for his wife] to profane himself.”

See verse 14; and Eze. 24:16-17.
Deu. 15:12.-“And if thy brother, [or thy sister], an Hebrew man, or an
Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee,” etc.
Psa. 142:4.-Ί looked on my right hand, and beheld [on my left hana.”
Isa. 30:17.-“One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the
rebuke of five shall ye [all] flee.”

Isa. 38:12.-“I have cut off as a weaver my life,” i.e., | have cut off my
life as a weaver [his thread].

Mat. 3:4.-“And a leathern girdle [was bound] about his loins.” In Joh.
7:39, the verb given is rightly supplied in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] : “For
the Holy Spirit was not yet given.”

Rom. 14:21.-“It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
thing whereby thy brother stumbleth,” ᾖθ., nor to do any thing
whereby, etc.

The point is not merely abstaining from the use of anything that
other people abuse, but from that which is a cause of stumbling to the
weak conscience of the brother in Christ, who thought it wrong to eat
or drink that which has been offered to an idol.

Rom. 16:16.-“Salute one another with an holy kiss.”
Here, the fact that ἀλλήλους (alleelous) is masculine, and the
undoubted and overwhelming testimony of the Primitive Church,
necessitate an Ellipsis; which must certainly be understood, if not
actually supplied. It was, and is, contrary to all Eastern usage for
women (who were always covered, 1Co. 11:5) and men to kiss each
other indiscriminately. The Ellipsis understood is:-“Salute one another
[men and women respectively] with a holy kiss.”

The Apostolical Constitutions (Cent. Ill.) say:-“Let the men salute
one another (masc.), and the women one another (fem.), with a kiss.”

In this sense are to be understood also 1Co. 16:20; 2Co. 13:12;
1Th. 5:26; 1Pe. 5:14.* [Note: For an exhaustive treatment of the whole
subject, see a work, entitled Salute One Another, by the Rev. Jas.
Neil, M.A. Lond.: Simpkin and Marshall.]

IV. Where the omitted Word is contained in another Word, the
One combining the two Significations
This has been called Metalepsis: but this is hardly correct; for
Metalepsis (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ) is a compound Metonomy, and а
Metonomy has to do only with nouns. It has also been called
Syntheton, or Synthesis (Latin, Compositio), which signifies the
placing of two things together. (See under the Figure of Metonymy). It
has also a Latin name: “Concisa Locutio,” i.e., a concise form of
speech, or abbreviated expression.

It is also called Constructio Praegnans, when the verb thus derives
an additional force.

Gen. 12:15.-“And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.”

Here the figure is translated, for МЧЗ (laqach) signifies to catch,
or capture. (Gen. 14:12. Num. 21:25. Deu. 3:14; Deu. 29:7. 1Sa.
19:14; 1Sa. 19:20. Isa. 52:5. Jer. 48:46). And here the two senses are
combined (take, in the sense of catch, and take, in the sense of /ead),
to take possession of, and lead into, i.e., “The woman was taken [and
brought] into Pharaoh’s house.”

See for a similar use, seized, or caught and led, or taken and

brought, etc., Gen. 15:9-10. Exo. 18:2; Exo. 25:2; Exo. 27:20. Num.
19:2. Est. 2:16.
Gen. 43:33.-“And the men marvelled one at another.” They did not
marvel one at another, but, marvelling at what Joseph did, they looked
one at another. The two senses are contained in the one verb,
thus:-“And the men marvelled [and looked] one at another.”
In verse 34, the two senses are translated both in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “and he took and sent
messes unto them from before him.” For this use of the verb puja
(nahsah) to take, see also Exo. 18:12; Exo. 25:2; Exo. 28:20, etc.

Exo. 23:18; Exo. 34:25.-Here the Hebrew *63 (zavach) to sacrifice,
or slay, is not literally translated, but the two senses, s/ay and pour out
(the blood) are combined in the one word “offer.”

The Heb. TM (al) is also in consequence translated with, instead

of upon. The result is that there is no sense in the translation. The
filling up of the Ellipsis preserves the literal signification of the other
words as well as the sense of the verse, thus:-“Thou shalt not slay
[and pour out] the blood of my sacrifice upon leavened bread.”
Lev. 17:3.-“What man soever there be of the house of Israel that
killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the
camp, and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation ... blood shall be imputed unto that man ... that man
shall be cut off from among his people.”
This appears to be quite at variance with Deu. 12:15; Deu. 12:21,
which expressly declares, “Thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.”

The difficulty is at once removed by supplying the second sense
which is included in the same word, “that killeth [in sacrifice].”

Num. 25:1.-Here, through not seeing the Ellipsis, AM (el) which
means fo, is translated with.

“And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of
Moab,” i.e., they “began to commit whoredom [and to join themselves]
to the daughters of Moab.”

Jos. 8:29.-“Joshua commanded that they should raise thereon a great
heap of stones that remaineth unto this day.”

Here, as well as in 10:27, the Ellipsis is supplied.
2Ch. 32:1.-“And thought to win them for himself.”-

Here MOUTH amie (I'vikam eylayo) means (as given in the
margin) to break them up, but this being “for himself,” conveyed no
sense; so the translation of the verb, which means “break up,” was
modified to “win,” in order to agree with the preposition “for.” But the
correct supply of the Ellipsis makes the meaning clear, and enables us
to retain the literal sense of the verb:-He “encamped against the
fenced cities, and thought to break them up [and annex them] to
himself,” or “thought to rend them [from the kingdom of Judah, and
annex them] to himself.”
Ezr. 2:62.-Here the figure is translated. The Heb., as given in the
margin, reads literally, “Therefore they were polluted from the
priesthood.” This is translated, “Therefore were they, as polluted, put
from the priesthood.” But a more correct translation of the figure would
be: “Therefore they were polluted [and put] from the priesthood.”
Psa. 21:12.-We have already noted the Ellipsis of the accusative in
this verse, “thine arrows.” Now we have the Ellipsis, in the same
verse, of the second signification of the verb:-“When thou shalt make
ready thine arrows upon thy bowstrings [and shoot them] against their
face.”
Psa. 22:21.-“Thou hast heard me [and delivered me], from the horns
of the unicorns.”

So Psa. 118:5, where the Ellipsis is correctly supplied. See also
Heb. verse 7, below.
Psa. 55:18.-“He hath delivered my soul in peace.” R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] : “He hath redeemed my soul in peace.”

The sense is obtained by supplying the Ellipsis-‘He hath
redeemed my soul [and set if] in peace.”

Psa. 63:8.-“My soul followeth hard after thee.”

Here to get the sense, the Heb. r6ug (dahvgah), which means to
cleave, to stick (see Gen. 2:24. Deu. 28:60. Psa. 119:31. Lam. 4:4), is
translated followeth hard, in order to combine it with ЭЗШИК,
(achareyach) after thee. “My soul followeth hard after thee.” The
supply of the Ellipsis makes the sense clear and retains the literal
meaning of the words, thus:-“My soul cleaveth to [and followeth] after
thee.”

Psa. 66:14.-The Heb. is:-“Which my lips have opened.” See margin.
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] translates freely, “Which my lips have uttered.” But the
sense is:-“Which (vows) my lips have opened [and vowed].”

Psa. 68:18.-“Thou hast received gifts for men.” The Heb. is:-“Thou
hast received gifts among men,” ᾖ6., “Thou hast received [and given]
gifts among men”; compare Eph. 4:8.

Psa. 73:27.-“Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from
thee.”

To make sense we must read:-“Thou hast destroyed all them that
go a whoring, [departing] from thee,” i.e., “Thou hast destroyed all
them that practise idolatry, departing from thee.”
Psa. 89:39.-Here the Ellipsis is supplied. “Thou hast profaned his
crown [by Casting if] to the ground.”

Psa. 104:22.-“The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and
lay them down in their dens.” The Heb. is:-“And unto their dens
(eamOoTepbh) they lie down,” i.e., “The sun ariseth, they gather
themselves together, [depart, and] lay themselves down in their dens.”
Pro. 25:22.-The Heb. reads:-“For coals of fire thou shalt receive upon
his head,” i.e., “for coals of fire thou Shalt receive [and place] upon his
head.”

The verb ЗЪД (chathah) means to take hold of, to seize, spoken
once of a person, Isa. 52:5 (7), and elsewhere always of taking up fire
or burning coals. See Isa. 30:14. Pro. 6:27. 1.е., the coals of fire which
thine enemy casts at thee, thou shalt take them and put them upon his
head: he will thus get what he intended for thee.

The “burning coals” are put by Metonymy (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] )
for cruel words and hard speeches (see Pro. 16:27; Pro. 26:23).

Psa. 140:9-10. But if thou doest good to him who uses cruel words
of you, that will burn him as coals of fire.
Mat. 4:5.-“Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy city.”
Παραλαμβάνω (paralamban6é) means to take and bring with one’s self,
to join one’s self. There is no equivalent for “up.” The double sense of
the verse must be supplied in the Ellipsis:-“Then the Devil taketh him
with himself [and leadeth] him,” etc. So verse 8 and 27:27. The sense
is sometimes completed by a second verb, Mat. 2:13; Mat. 2:20. Joh.
19:16. Act. 23:18.
Mat. 5:23.-“Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee”; {6., “if thou
bring thy gift [even thy sacrifice] to the altar.” An offering was the only
gift that could be brought to an altar. In Lev. 2:1-2, the Septuagint
translates, “If a soul bring a gift, a sacrifice, to the Lord, his gift shall
be,” etc., and thus supplies the explanatory words. To apply these
words to the placing money on the Lord’s Table is a perverse use of
language.
Luk. 4:1-2.-“And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from
Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days
tempted of the devil.”

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] connects the forty days with the temptation: but
we learn from Mat. 4:3 that it was not till after the forty days that the
tempter came to Him, when He was hungry. The words are elliptical,
and are a concisa locutio, i.e., an abbreviated expression, in order that
our thought may dwell on the fact of the /eading, rather than on the
fact of His being there.

The Greek is:-“He was being led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
[and was in the wilderness] forty days.”
Luk. 4:38.-“And he arose out of the synagogue,” i.e., “And rising up
[he departed] out* [Note: The ancient reading was ἀγὸ, from,
supported by the Critical Texts of Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, and
Westcott and Hort. It was altered later by some copyist who did not
see the force of the figure, so as to make it agree better with the single
verb employed.] of the synagogue, and entered into the house of
Simon.” By this figure our attention is directed to the fact which is
important, viz., His rising up, and thus preventing any comment on the
miracle; rather than to the mere act of going out of the synagogue.
Luk. 18:14.- tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
than the other.”
The Greek reads, “This man went down to his house justified than
the other,” but the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] correctly supplies the disjunction
contained in the comparative ἤ (ee), when following a positive
assertion. The thought lies in the Heb. use of the word ОП (min), Psa.
118:8-9 : “It is better to trust in the Lord than [i.e., and пой to put
confidence in man. /t is better to trust in the Lord than [i.e., and пой to
put confidence in princes.” So Jon. 4:3. “Now, O Lord, take, | beseech
thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than [i.e., and пой to
live.”

So in the N.T., Heb. 11:25 : “Choosing rather to suffer affliction with
the People of God, than [i.e., and пой to enjoy the pleasures of sin for
8 season.”

So here the doctrine is that the Publican was justified and not the
Pharisee. Not that the Pharisee was justified a little, and the Publican
was justified a little more! The parable is wholly concerning
justification (verse 9), and not a parable about the nature of prayer.
The manner of the prayer is merely the vehicle for the illustration of
the truth.* [Note: Ignorance of the doctrine of justification, it may have
been, or oversight as to the point of the parable, that gave rise to the
difficulties presented by the Text, which was altered and glossed in
various ways in order to make sense. The Textus Receptus has
ἢ ἐκεῖνος, the mss. APQ, &c. have й 74? €?717??, with T.Tr. marg.
(i.e., “This man went down to his house justified ... or was it then the
other, &c.”). The mss. BLa have 22ῤ €?712??, with L.Tr.WH.AIf. (i.e.,
passing over the other).]

Luk. 19:44.-“And shall lay thee even with the ground.” ἐδαφίζειν
(edaphizein) signifies both {ο level to the ground, and to dash to the
ground. In this last sense it occurs in Psa. 137:9. Hos. 10:14; LXX.
[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

Luk. 20:9.-“A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to
husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time,” i.e., “he
went into a far country, [and remained there] a long time”; or, we may
supply, “and was absent for a long time.”

Luk. 21:38.-“And all the people came early in the morning to him in
the temple, for to hear him.”

But ὀρθρίζω (orthriz6) does not mean to come early, but {ο rise up
early, and the sense is:-“And all the people rising early in the morning,
[came] to him in the temple.”

Joh. 1:23.-“He said, | am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,”
etc.: i.e., “Il [am he of whom it is written] the voice of one crying in the
wilderness.”
Joh. 6:21.-“Then they willingly received him into the ship.” Here the
figure is hidden by a free translation. The Greek is:-“They were willing,
then, to receive him into the ship, [and they did receive him].”
Act. 7:9.-“And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into
Egypt,” i.e., “And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph [and
sent him away] into Egypt.

Ἀποδίδωμι (apodidémi) does not mean merely fo sell, but to put
away by giving over, whether for money or for any other return.
Act. 20:30.-“Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them,” i.e., “speaking
perverse things [and seeking] to draw away.”
Act. 23:24.-“And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and
bring him safe unto Felix the governor.” The Greek is, ΙΗ.,:- διασώζω
(dias6z6) to save through,” i.e., “and keep him in safety [and bring
him] unto Felix.”
Here, by the omission of the verb {ο bring, which is required by the
preposition, our attention is called to the fact which is of greater
importance, viz., the preservation of Paul from his enemies.

Gal. 5:4.-“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you
are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.”

The Greek ἶς:-κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ (kateergeetheete apo
tou Christou); and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
translates it:-“Ye are severed from Christ,” and puts in the margin,
Greek “brought to nought.” But we may take the Greek literally, if we
put the margin in the Text and supply the Ellipsis correctly:-

“Ye are made void [and cut off] from Christ.”

Eph. 4:8.-“When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive
and, [receiving] gifts, gave them to men.” See Psa. 68:18 above.

2Ti. 1:10.-“And hath brought life and immortality to light through the
gospel.”

Here, following the order of the Greek, we may read:-“And brought
to light, [and procured for us] life and immortality through the gospel.”
By the Figure of Hendiadys (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), that which is
procured is immortal life, showing us that the emphasis is on the word
“immortal.”
2Ti. 2:26.-“And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of
the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.”

Here both the figure and the sense are lost by defective
translation. The margin tells us that the words “recover themselves”
are used to render the Greek “awake,” i.e., “lest they may awake [and
be delivered] out of the snare of the devil.”

The structure of this Scripture makes the whole passage clear:-

Subversion.
Α 14. The aim of the enemy “Subversion” (καταστροφῇ).
В — 15. The workman (ἐργάτης).
©С 16. Exhortation. “Shun.”
D 17, 18-. Illustration. “Canker.”
Е  -18. Effect on others. “Overthrown.”
E 19. Effect on Foundation. “Standeth sure.”
D 20,21. Illustration. “Vessels.”
C 22, 23. Exhortation. “Flee ... Avoid.”
В 24, 25-. The Servant (δοῦλος).
А -25, 26. The aim of the enemy. “Opposition” (ἀντιδιατιθέμενοι).
Then by expanding this last member A, we see the meaning of
verses -25, 26:-
A. The aim of the enemy.
А а -25-. “Lest God should give them repentance”
b — -25. “Unto (εἰς) the knowledge of the truth,”
а — 26-. “And lest, being taken alive by him, [by God, as in “а”]
they may awake [and be delivered] from the devil's snare”
Ь -26. “Unto (εἰς) his [6οα”5] will (i.e., to do the will of
God).”
Here in “a” and “a” we have the action of God in delivering, while in
“b” and “b” we have the object for which the captive is delivered.
2Ti. 4:18.-“And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom:” i.e., “preserve me, [and
bring mej.” Thus fixing our thought rather on the wondrous
preservation than on the act of bringing.
Heb. 5:3.-“And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also
for himself, to offer [sacrifices] for sins.”
Heb. 5:7.-“And was heard [and delivered] from his fear.” ἁπὸ τῆς
εὐλαβείας (apo tees eulabeias). (Only here and Heb. 12:28). See Psa.
22:21, above.
Heb. 9:16-17.-“For where a testament is, there must also of necessity
be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are
dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all whilst the testator liveth.”

It is clear that it is a “covenant” to which these words refer, and not
a testamentary document. The reference to the “first” covenant at
Sinai mentioned in the verses which immediately follow, decides this
for us. See Exo. 24:5-8.
And the mention also of the sprinkling of the blood shows that
sacrifices are referred to.

The word translated “testator” is the participle:-dia8éyevoc
(diathemenos), and means appointed.* [Note: Participle of 2222322222
(diatitheemi), to appoint (566 Luk. 22:29). “And | appoint unto you a
kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.” Act. 3:25 : “The
covenant which God made with our fathers.” Heb. 8:10 : “This is the
covenant which | will make with the house of Israel after those days,
saith the Lord.” So also Heb. 10:16. These are the only places where
the verb occurs, except this passage.] Its use shows that the sacrifice
by which the covenant was made is really contained in the word.

And the word διαθήκη (diatheekee) everywhere means covenant.

So that, in accordance with these Scriptures and facts, we may
translate verses 16-18, as follows:-

“For where a covenant is, there must also of necessity be the
death of him (or that) which makes [the sacrifice]. For a covenant is of
force over* [Note: ἐπί means over, as marking the ground or
foundation of the action. See Mat. 24:47. Luk. 12:44; Luk. 15:7 (7), 10;
19:41; 23:38. Act. 8:2. 1Th. 3:7. Rev. 11:10; Rev. 18:11. It is
translated, “upon” and “on,” etc., many times; but “after” only here and
Luk. 1:59.] dead [victims or sacrifices]; otherwise it is never held to be
of force while he who is the appointed [sacrifice] is alive. Where-upon
neither the first [covenant] was dedicated without blood,” etc.
Heb. 10:23.-“Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,”
i.e., “Having our hearts sprinkled [and so being delivered] from an evil
conscience.”
1Pe. 3:20.-“Were saved by water,” i.e, “Were preserved [and
delivered] by water.”
Rev. 13:3.-“And all the world wondered after the beast.” ὁπίσω (opis6)
is an adverb of place or time, and means back, behind, after (see Rev.
1:10; Rev. 12:15). It cannot, therefore, be taken in connection simply
With wondered. But the following is the sense:-

“And all the world wondered [and followed] after the beast.”
Rev. 20:2.-“And bound him a thousand years,” i.e., “And bound him
[and kept him bound] a thousand years.”

C. The Ellipsis of Repetition:

Where the omitted word or words is, or are to be supplied out of the
preceding or following clause, in order to complete the sense.
This Ellipsis is either simple or complex.

Simple, when anything is to be repeated separately, either out of
what precedes or follows.

Complex, when two things are to be repeated; one out of a
preceding clause into the following clause; and at the same time
another out of the following into the preceding clause.

|. Simple
1. Where the Omission is to be supplied by REPEATING a word or
words out of the Preceding Clause

(a) Nouns and Pronouns
Exo. 12:4.-“Let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it,”
ie., the lamb from verse 3.
1Ki. 1:6.-“And [Haggith] bare him after Absalom.”
2Ki. 3:25.-“Only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof.”

The Heb. reads (see margin):-“Until he left the stones thereof in
Kir-haraseth.”
The Ellipsis is to be supplied from verse 24. “Until in Kir-haraseth
[only] they left the stones thereof [fo the Moabites].”
Psa. 12:6, (7).-“The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried
in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.”
Here there is an important Ellipsis. № has been a great difficulty
with many to think that the Lord’s words should require purifying,
especially after the declaration in the first part of the verse, that they
are “pure.” What increases the difficulty is the fact that the word for
earth is ALUIX (eretz), the earth: i.e., the dry land or the world as
created, as in Gen. 1:1 : “In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth” (ALLIX, επείζ). It is generally taken as though it were
used of a crucible made of earth or clay; but in this case it would be
аГОД (adamah), ground, soil, clay; and not eretz, the whole earth;
Moreover, the Lamed prefixed (М) means fo or pertaining to. It is the
sign of the dative case and not of the genitive. The Revisers note this
and render it:-“As silver tried in a furnace on the earth,” as though it
was important for us to note that it is not in or under the earth! But this
does not touch the real difficulty. This is removed only by correctly
supplying the Ellipsis, and repeating the noun “words” from the
beginning of the verse.

Then, all is clear, and we not only may, but must then take the rest
of the words in their literal sense. Thus:-“The words of the Lord are
pure words, as silver tried in a furnace; [words] of the earth: (or
pertaining to the earth), purified seven times.”
That is to say the words in which Jehovah has been pleased to
make His revelation, are not the words of angels (1Co. 13:1), nor the
“unspeakable words of Paradise” (2Co. 12:4), but they were words
pertaining to man in this world-human words-but refined and purified
as Silver. Hence, in taking human language, there are many words
which the Holy Spirit has not chosen, and which cannot be found in
the Scriptures:

Some are exalted to an altogether higher meaning as

ἀρετή (aretee), as man had used it, meant merrily excellence
of any kind, manhood, nobility, valour, prowess. But, in the
Scriptures, it is used in the higher sense of glory (Hab. 3:3),
praise (58. 42:8; Isa. 42:12; Isa. 43:21; Isa. 53:7). And 5ο
in the New Testament, Php. 4:8; 1Pe. 2:9; 2Pe. 1:3; 2Pe.
1:5.

ἦθος (eethos) was only the haunt of an animal, but it became
custom, morals, character.

Some are used in a totally different sense from that in which they
had ever been used before.

χορηγέω (спогеедс) was simply to furnish or lead a chorus,
hut
it was changed {ο furnish or supply. 1Pe. 4:11 : “My God

shall supply all your need.”
εὐαγγέλιον (euangelion) was merely the dispatch containing

the news, but it was used in the new sense of the gospel of

God.
ἐκκλησία (ekkleesia) was used by the Greeks of any assembly,

but especially of citizens, or as we should say of a

selection from them, “burgesses.” The word means an

assembly of those called out, an elect assembly.

Hence it is used in the Septuagint of Israel as called out
from and as being an election from the nations.

Then, it was used of the congregation worshipping at the
Tabernacle as distinguished from the rest of the people.

In this sense it is used in the Old Testament, the Gospels,
and partly in the Acts. But in the Pauline Epistles the Holy
Spirit uses the word and exalts it to a far higher meaning; viz.,
of the special election from both Jews and Gentiles, forming
them as members of Christ’s Mystical Body into a new ecclesia
or assembly. This is a sense in which it had never before been
used.* [Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and
publisher.]

σωτηρία (séteeria) was merely preservation or deliverance
from danger, but in the Scriptures it is “the salvation of
God.”
παράκλητος (paracleetos) was merely the legal assistant or
helper. In the New Testament there is one Paracleetos
within us that we may not Sin (Joh. 14:16; Joh. 14:26; Joh.
15:26; Joh. 16:7); and another Paracleetos with the Father
if we do sin (1Jn. 2:1).

σκάνδαλον (skandalon) was used only of the trigger of a trap
to catch animals; but in the New Testament it is used in a
new and moral sense, of that which causes any one to be
caught or made to trip.

Other words were coined by the Holy Spirit Himself, and cannot be
found in any human writings.

σκανδαλίζω (skandaliz6) is a new word altogether. It is never
used in Classical Greek, it means {ο cause to stumble or
fall, to give cause of offence.

ἐπιούσιος (epiousios) is a word used only by our Lord (Mat.
6:11 and Luk. 11:3) in the Lord’s Prayer, where it is
rendered “daily.”
Hence the difficulty in interpreting it, as there is no usage to

help us. It is a question, therefore, of etymology. It is the
preposition ἐπὶ (epi), upon, prefixed to the participle of a verb.
But what verb? It cannot be the participle of the verb εἰμί
(eimi), to be, for its participle is οὖσα (ousa), and the
combination of otica with ἐπ] would be ἐποῦσα. It must be εἶμι
(eimi), to go or come, for its participle is ἰοῦσα (iousa), and the
combination of ἰοῦσα with ἐτή will be ἐπιοῦσα, as used by our
Lord. The word means, therefore, coming upon or going upon,
and would refer either to bread for our going or journeying
upon, or to the bread coming or descending upon us from
heaven, as the manna descended and came down upon Israel
(Joh. 6:32-33).

Hence it combines the two ideas of heavenly and daily,
inasmuch as the manna not only came down from heaven, but
did so every day, and on the strength of this they journeyed. It
is a word therefore of great fulness of meaning.

That the Ellipsis exists in Psa. 12:6 (which verse we are
considering), and may be thus supplied, is shown further from the
structure of the Psalm:-

Α 1. Decrease of good.

В а _ 2.Man’s words (Falsehood).
Ь — 3, 4. Their end: “cut off.”
6 5-. Oppression.
р -5-. Sighing.
р -5-. | will arise (for sighing).
©С -5.1 will deliver (from oppression).
В а 6. Jehovah's words (Truth).
Ь — 7. Their end: (preserved).

Α 8. Increase of bad.

Here in B, Jehovah’s words are placed in contrast with man’s
words in B: in a and a, their character respectively: and in b and b
their end.

Finally, we may expand a (verse 6) as follows:-

a ο The words of Jehovah are pure words.

@ — As silver tried in a furnace:
с [Words] pertaining to the earth.
а Purified seven times.

Here in c and c we have “words,” and in d and d we have the
purifying of the silver.

Psa. 68:18.-“Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity
captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also,
that the Lord God might dwell among them,” i.e., among or with those
rebels who have been taken captives.

Ecc. 12:11.-‘The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails
fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one
shepherd.”

Here, instead of repeating “the words” from the first clause, the
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] inserts the word “by,” thus producing incoherence in the
passage. The structure shows us at once how the Ellipsis should be
filled up.

а — The words of the wise

bare as goads,
bandas tent-pegs well fixed,

а are [the words] of the masters of the assemblies.

Here, in a and a, we have “words,” and in b and b, what they are
compared to.
In “a” we have the words of those which act like goads, inciting to
action, or probing the conscience; while in a we have the words of
those who are the leaders of assemblies, propounding firmly
established principles and settled teaching. “Both of these (not
“which”) are given by the same shepherd.”

That is, as a chief shepherd gives to one servant a goad for his
use, and to another a stake, or “tent-peg,” to fix firmly in the ground,
so the God of all wisdom, by the Chief Shepherd in glory, gives to His
servants “words,” different in their tendency and action, but conducing
to the same end, showing the one source from which the various gifts
are received. He gives to some of His under-shepherds “words” which
act as goads; while He gives to others “words” which “stablish,
strengthen and settle.”

Isa. 40:13.-“Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his
counsellor hath taught him?”

Here the Ellipsis is arbitrarily supplied by the word “being,” which
necessitates a departure from the Heb., which is given in the margin,
“made him understand.”

The Ellipsis is correctly supplied thus:-“Who hath directed the
Spirit of the Lord; or [who] as His counsellor hath made him to
understand?”

Amo. 3:12.-“As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two
legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out
that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a
couch,” i.e., “and [in the corner ой a couch.”

Mal. 2:14.-“Yet ye say, Wherefore?” i.e., from verse 13, wherefore
[does He not regard our offering, etc.]?

Act. 7:15-16.-“So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our
fathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the
father of Sychem.”

Here the article τοῦ (tou), of the, rendered “the father,” should be
év (en), in, according to Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and
the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

There must have been three purchases altogether, of which two
are recorded in Genesis, and one in Act. 7:1-60

(1) According to Act. 7:16, Abraham bought a sepulchre from the
sons of Hamor.

There is no record of this purchase in Genesis. But Stephen, “full
of the Holy Ghost,” supplies the information. It was purchased of
Hamor, the son of Shechem, for “a sum of money.” Shechem was the
place where God first appeared to Abraham in Canaan (Gen. 12:6),
and where he first built an altar (verse 7). Here it was that (according
to Act. 7:16) he bought “a sepulchre.”

The original Shechem must have been an important person to
have given his name to a place; and it was of his son that Abraham
bought it.

(2) According to Gen. 23:1-20, Abraham purchased a field with
trees in it and round it; and a cave called Machpelah at the end of it. It
was situated at Hebron (Mamre), and was purchased of Ephron the
Hittite, the son of Zohar, for 400 shekels of silver. Here Abraham
buried Sarah, and here he himself was buried. Here also were buried
Isaac, Rebekah and Jacob (Gen. 49:29-32; Gen. 50:13).

(3) Jacob’s purchase in Gen. 33:19, was years afterward, of
another Hamor, another descendant of the former Shechem. What
Jacob bought was “a parcel of a field,” of Hamor, a Hivite, perhaps the
very field which surrounded the “sepulchre” which Abraham had
before bought of an ancestor of this Hamor. Jacob gave 100 pieces of
money (or lambs, margin) for it. Here Joseph was buried (Jos. 24:32),
and here Jacob’s sons were “carried over,” or transferred, as Joseph
was.
Now Act. 7:15 speaks of two parties, as well as of three
purchases:-“he” ({6., Jacob), and “our fathers.” In verse 16 the verb is
plural and must necessarily refer not to “he” (Jacob), who was buried
in Machpelah, but to “our fathers.” They were carried over and laid in
the sepulchre that Abraham bought, not of “Ephron the Hittite” (Gen.
23:1-20), but of Hamor the Hivite.

In the abbreviated rehearsal of facts well known to all to whom
Stephen spoke, and who would gladly have caught at the least slip, if
he had made one, Stephen condensed the history, and presented it
elliptically thus:-

“So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers, and
[our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre:-
[he, i.e., Jacob] in that which (ᾧ, Πο" [Note: Griesbach, Lachmann,
Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Wordsworth, Westcott and Hort, read ᾧ
(6) in that which, instead of 6 (Πο) which.] ) Abraham bought for a
sum of money, [and they in that which was bought] from the sons of
Hamor in Sychem.”

It is probable that the rest of the “fathers” who died in Egypt were
gathered to both of these burial places, for Josephus says (Ant. lib.
2.4) that they were buried at Hebron; while Jerome (Ep. ad
Pammach.) declares that in his day their sepulchres were at
Shechem, and were visited by strangers.

Rom. 6:5.-“For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.” Here it is,
“We shall be raised [in the likeness] of his resurrection also.” (See
above, pages 18, 19).

Rom. 12:11.-“Not slothful in business.” Lit., “not slothful in earnest
care [i.e., earnest care for others (from verse 10).”

1Со. 2:11.-“For what man knoweth the things of a man?” /е., the
[deep] things (or depths), from verse 10-the secret thoughts and
purposes of the spirit of man. “So the [deep] things (or depths) of God,
knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.”

1Со. 2:13.-“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
spiritual things with spiritual:”
Here we have, first, to repeat in the second clause the expression
“in the words” from the first clause:-“Not in the words which man’s
wisdom teacheth, but [in the words] which the Holy Ghost teacheth.”
This prepares the way for the supply of the important Ellipses of the
last sentence. The two adjectives “spiritual” (one neuter accusative
plural and the other masculine dative plural) must have nouns which
they respectively qualify, and the question is, What are these nouns to
be? The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] suggests “things” (which ought to have been in
italics). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] suggests, in the
margin, two different nouns:-‘interpreting spiritual things to spiritual
men.” Much depends on the meaning of the verb συγκρίνω (sunkrind)
which occurs only here, and in 2Co. 10:12, in the New Testament. Its
etymological meaning is clear, being a compound of κρίνω (krind), to
separate or sift (hence, to judge) and σύν (sun), together with, so that
it means literally to separate or take to pieces and then to put
together. When we do this with things, we compare them by judging
them, or we judge them by comparing them; hence, συγκρίνω
(sunkrino), is translated “compare” in 2Co. 10:12, and is used of the
foolishness of those who “measuring themselves by themselves, and
comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise” (margin,
“understand # not”). Here the force of the idea of judging is clearly
seen. So also the verb is used in Wis. 7:29, where wisdom “being
compared with the light is found before it.” In Wis. 15:18 :-“They
worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being
compared together, some are worse than others.”

In 1Ma. 10:71, the idea of judging is very clear, being translated
“try.” Apollonius says to Jonathan, “Now therefore, if thou trustest in
thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let
us try the matter together;” i.e., let us judge or determine the matter
together.

In Gen. 40:8; Gen. 40:16; Gen. 40:22; Gen. 41:12; Gen. 41:15, itis
used for Cpbu (pahthar), to open, hence, to interpret; and in Dan.
5:13; Dan. 5:17 for the Chald. Φμμίι (p’shar), to explain, interpret;
also in Num. 15:34 for Φμιῃῃ (pahrash), to separate or divide, hence
(in Pual), to declare distinctly.* [Note: See also Neh. 8:8, “distinctly,”
and Ezr. 4:18, “plainly.”]

“And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
should be done to him” (i.e., to the man who had gathered
sticks on the Sabbath).

Hence, for these are all the occurrences of the verb συγκρίνω
(sunkrin6é), the general meaning of the verb is to communicate
distinctly so as to expound or interpret or make anything clear and
plain: i.e., to separate or take anything to pieces and put it together
again so as to make its nature or construction known. This meaning-to
make known or declare-thus seems to combine all the various ideas
included in the verb. For we cannot become known to ourselves by
measuring ourselves with others (2Co. 10:12). Hence the dreams
were interpreted or made known (Gen. 40:8, etc.), and it was not
made known what was to be done to the Sabbath-breaker (Num.
15:34). This meaning, too, agrees with 1Co. 2:13, where it is used in
connection with persons.

Some propose to supply the Ellipsis with the word “words” from the
former part of the verse. But though it is true, in fact, that the apostle
declared spiritual things with spiritual words, it is not in harmony with
what is said in the larger context here.
In verse 1 he explains that when he came to them he could not
declare unto them “the mystery of God.” For so the words must be
read, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , and all the
critical Greek Texts.* [Note: 2222232223 (musteerion), mystery, and not
3:68: (marturion), testimony.]

He was obliged to confine his teaching to truths connected with
“Christ crucified,” and could not go on to those glorious truths
connected with Christ risen (as in Eph. and Col.) Howbeit (he adds)
we do “teach wisdom among them that are initiated” (verse 5), even
the mystery (verse 6) which had been hidden, but which God had now
revealed (verse 10) to him and to the Church through him: viz., the
hitherto profound and absolute secret of the Body of Christ, consisting
of Christ the glorious Head in heaven, and His people the members of
that body here upon earth; Jews and Gentiles forming “one new man”
in Christ.

But these Corinthians (when he went to them) were all taken up
with their own “Bodies.” One said, “I am of Paul”; and another, “I am of
Apollos.” How, then, could they be prepared to hear, and be initiated
into, the wondrous secret concerning the One Body?

No! These “spiritual things” could be declared and made known
only (verse 13) to “spiritual persons,” and the apostle says (3:1-6): “I
could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.”

This, then, is evidently the scope of the whole context, and it
shows us that to receive these “spiritual things” we must be “spiritual
persons”: members of the One Body of Christ, rather than of one of
the many “bodies” of men. Then we shall be prepared to learn the
“deep things of God,” which Were afterwards taught to these
Corinthian saints by epistle in 1Co. 12:1-31+ [Note: See further on this
subject in a pamphlet on The Mystery, by the same author and
publisher.]
1Co. 4:4.-“For | know nothing by myself, yet am | not hereby justified.”

Le., “For | am not conscious to myself of any [unfaithful, from verse
2] thing, yet | am not justified by this; but he that judgeth me is the
Lord,” and He is able to bring all such hidden and secret things to
light. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has “against
myself.”
2Co. 3:16.-“Nevertheless when [their heart, from verse 15] shall turn
to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away [from : i.e., “is taken away”
(R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ), for it is the present tense,
and is very emphatic because it explains why their heart shall turn to
the Lord! We might almost read it “When the veil is taken away from
[their heart], it shall turn to the Lord.” See Mal. 4:6.
2Co. 6:16.-“And what agreement hath the temple of God with [the
temple of] idols?”

2Co. 11:14-15.-“And no marvel; for Satan himself transformeth himself
into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great [marvel] if his ministers
also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end
shall be according to their works:” whatever may be their present
appearance or “reward.”

This is the most dangerous of all Satan’s “devices.” (1) He goes
about as “a roaring lion” (1Pe. 5:8), and we know that we must flee
from him. (2) He beguiles through his subtilty, as “the old serpent”
(2Co. 11:3), and there is great fear, lest we be “corrupted.” But (3),
most dangerous of all, he transforms himself into “an angel of light.”
Here it is that God’s servants are deceived and “join affinity” with
Ahabs and Jezebels to “do (so-called) good”!
Eph. 3:17-19.-“That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye
being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with
all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to
know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be
filled with all the fulness of God.”

We following the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
rendering and supplying the Ellipsis from the preceding clause:-

“That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that
(iva) ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to
apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height
and depth [of love is] even (τε) to know the love of Christ which
passeth knowledge,” etc.

We are to be rooted as a tree, in love; we are to be founded as a
building in love; but we can never know what it is in all its length and
breadth and height and depth until we know Christ's love for us, for
that surpasses all knowledge.

Bengel beautifully explains the four terms: the “length” extending
through all ages from everlasting to everlasting; the “breadth”
extending to people from all nations; the “height” to which no man can
reach or attain, and from which no creature can pluck us; its “depth,”
so deep that it cannot be fathomed or exhausted. (see on this verse
above, page 18.)
1Ti. 1:16.-“Howbeit, for this cause | obtained mercy that in me first
Jesus Christ might show forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them
which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.”
Here πρῶτος (prétos), translated “first,” is the same word which is
translated “chief in the preceding verse. If We retain this rendering,
we may also supply the Ellipsis from the same context, thus:-“That in
me the chief [of sinners], Jesus Christ might show forth all long
suffering.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders “that in me
as chief,” etc.
Heb. 2:11.-“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
are all [sons] of one [father]: for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren.”
Heb. 7:4.-“Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even
the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.”

There is here no word for “man” in the Greek, and we may better
supply the word “priest” from verse 3. “Now consider how great this
[priest] was.”
Tit. 3:8.-“This is a faithful saying, and these things | will that thou
affirm constantly.” The Greek reads, as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , “concerning these.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] supply “things.” But we may repeat the
word “heirs” from the preceding verse:-“That being justified by his
grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
This is a faithful saying, and concerning these [heirs] | will that thou
affirm constantly (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,
confidently), that they which have believed in God might be careful to
maintain good works.”

1Jn. 2:2.-“He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but
also for the sins of the whole world.”

The words here are correctly repeated from the preceding clause.
The contrast is between “ours” and “the world.” A very emphatic word
is here used for “ours,” not the genitive case of the ordinary pronoun
ἡμῶν (heemén) “our,” which is used in the first clause, but a special
possessive pronoun, which is very emphatic, ἡμετέρος (heemeteros),
our own. It is used of that which is peculiarly ours as distinct from that
which belongs to others, e.g.:-
Act. 2:11. We do hear them speak in our tongues.

Act. 24:6. According to our law.

Act. 26:5. Sect of our religion.

Rom. 15:4. Were written for our learning.

2Ti. 4:15. He hath greatly withstood our words.

Tit. 3:14. And let ours also learn.

4Jn. 1:3. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and his
Son, Jesus Christ.

So that “our sins” refers to the writer and his People, as Jews, as
distinct from the rest of the world. Before this, propitiation was only for
the sins of Israel; but now, and henceforth, Christ's propitiation was for
all without distinction, “out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
and nation”: not for all without exception, for then all must be saved,
which is not the case.

See further on this verse under Synecdoche.

(b) Where the omitted Verb is to be repeated from a preceding
clause
Gen. 1:30.-The verb “/ have given” is correctly repeated in the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] from verse 29.
Gen. 4:24.-“If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy
and sevenfold,” i.e., “Lamech [shall be avenged] seventy and
sevenfold.”

This is spoken with reference to what is stated in the preceding
verse, which is very obscure both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,
or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it “I have slain,”
and margin “/ would slay,” while the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] renders it “I have slain a man for wounding me,” etc., and
margin “/ will slay.” But we must note that these words of Lamech
were called forth by the fact that through his son, who was “an
instructor of every artificer in brass and iron,” Lamech was in
possession of superior weapons.

This is the earliest form of poetry in the Bible. It is significant that it
should be in praise of that violence which was soon to overspread the
earth. It is in praise of the new weapons of war which Lamech had
now obtained; and so proud is he of his newly-acquired power, that if
anyone injured him he declares that he would be so avenged that he
would outdo Jehovah in His punishment of Cain. See further for the
poetical form, under Parallelism.

Deu. 1:4.-“And Og, the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth [he
(i.e., Moses) slew] in Edrei.” See Num. 21:33. Deu. 3:1.

1К!. 20:34.-“Then said Ahab.” The verb must be repeated from the
preceding clause.

Psa. 1:5.-“Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, and
sinners [shall not stand] in the congregation of the righteous.”

Thus, the blessing of the righteous is, that they do not stand
among “sinners” (verse 1) now; and the punishment of the ungodly will
be that they shall not stand among the righteous in the judgment
(verse 5).

Psa. 45:3.-“Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, О most mighty: [gird
thyself] with thy glory and thy majesty.”

Psa. 126:4.-“Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the
south.”

There must be a figure employed here, as the grammatical
construction is not complete. There is neither subject nor verb in the
second clause, as will be apparent if we set them forth, thus:-
Subject.
Verb.
Object.
О Lord as...
turn again ...
our captivity, the streams of the south.

Consequently, it is clear that a figure is employed, and that this
figure is Ellipsis.

The correct supply of the Ellipsis will enable us to give a literal
translation of the other words. The comparison employed shows us
that the verb required in the second sentence must be repeated from
the first.
“Turn again our captivity, О Lord, as [thou turnest] the streams in
the south.” But this does not yield the whole sense, unless we see the
correct and literal meaning of the words.

The word “streams” is aqbunH (apheekeem). It is from the root
αφή (aphak) to put a force, constraint or restraint upon (Gen. 43:30;
Gen. 45:1. Est. 5:19).

It is the proper name for a narrow and practically inaccessible
water-course, either natural (in a gorge, or underground); or artificial
(in an aqueduct), in which the water is forced, restrained, and turned
about by its strong barriers in various directions. It occurs eighteen
times.* [Note:

2Sa. 22:16. “The channels of the sea appeared.”

Job. 6:15. “As the stream of brooks they pass away.”

Job. 12:21. “He weakeneth the strength of the mighty” (i.e., the
apheekeem).

Job. 40:18. “His [Behemoth’s] bones are as strong pieces of brass”
(i.e., like apheekeem or aqueducts of brass).
Job. 41:15. “His [Leviathan’s] scales are his pride” (marg., strong
pieces of shields).

Psa. 18:15. “Then the channels of waters were seen.”

Psa. 42:1. “As the hart panteth (marg., brayeth) after the water-
brooks:” i.e., the apheekeem. So also Joe. 1:20.

Psa. 126:4. “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the
south.”

Song Son. 5:12. “His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers
of waters” (1.6., inhabiting the rocky cliffs of the apheekeem).

Isa. 8:7. “He [the king of Assyria] shall come up over all his
channels’ (i.e., over the rocky barriers of the apheekeem).

Eze. 6:3. “Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the
hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys” (1.6., to the gorges and the
valleys, answering to the mountains and hills of the first line). So also
36:4, 6.

Eze. 31:12. “His boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land.”

Eze. 32:6. “The rivers shall be full of thee.”
Eze. 34:13. “And feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the
rivers.”

Eze. 35:8. “And in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with
the [sword.”

Joe. 3:18. “All the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters.”] Six
times with the word “sea” or “waters.” Thus in Psa. 42:1 and Joe. 1:20,
the hart is pictured TMOacbnynOonH (al apheekai mayim),
over (not “for,” see Gen. 1:2, “darkness was upon the face of the
deep”; 1:20, “fowl that may fly above the earth,” etc.), above the
apheekai mayim. The hart hears the rushing of the waters far below in
their rocky bed, and she “crieth out” (ТШВ (arag) to cry, to long for,
only here and Joe. 1:20) for the waters she cannot reach.

Then as to the word rendered “south” ΦΡ6, Negeb). This is the
proper name of a certain district in Canaan. It was “south” relatively to
Canaan, but not absolutely. This is clear from Gen. 12:9, where we
read, “Abram journeyed [from Bethel] going on still toward the south”
(ΠΡΒΘΠ, the Negeb). Afterwards we read (13:1): “And Abram went
up (north) out of Egypt ... into the south” (ΠΡΒΘΠ, the Negeb).t
[Note: It is still more clear from Deu. 1:7, where we have four distinct
topographical names:-‘in the plain (ie., in ARABAH, the Jordan
Valley), in the hills (1.6., the HILL COUNTRY of Judah), and in the vale
(i.e., in SHEPHELAH, the plain of Philistia), in the south” (i.e., in the
NEGEB, the region south of the hill country of Judah).

For other passages, see Num. 13:17; Num. 13:29; Num. 21:1.
Deu. 34:3. Jos. 10:40 : Jos. 12:8; Jos. 15:21. Jdg. 1:1-36 : 1Sa. 30:1.
Jer. 17:6.

Noting these words, several passages are greatly elucidated, such
as Jer. 32:44; Jer. 33:13. Zec. 7:7. Gen. 13:1, etc.]
The Negeb is intersected by deep and rocky gorges, or wadis,
called “apheekeem.” Springs and wells are almost unknown in that
region.

We Can now take the literal signification of these words, and
supply the Ellipsis by repeating the verb of the first clause, in the
second, and thus learn the meaning of the passage:-“Turn again our
captivity, О Lord, as [thou turnest] the apheekeem in the Negeb,” i.e.,
as those rushing waters are turned hither and thither by their mighty,
rocky barriers, so Thou canst put forth Thy might, and restrain the
violence of our enemies, and turn us again (as the rocky cliffs and
walls turn about the apheekeem) into our own land.

Pro. 10:23.-“It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
understanding, hath wisdom,” i.e., “It is as sport to a fool to do
mischief, but [fo exercise] wisdom [is as sport] to a man of
understanding.”

Pro. 17:21.-“He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow,” i.e.,
begetteth him to his sorrow.

1К!. 14:14.-“The Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel who shall
cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now,” i.e., “but
what [do | say]? even now [has he raised him up]:” for Baasha, who
was to cut off the house of Jeroboam, had even then been born.
Chap. 15:27, etc. See under Aposiopesis.

2Ki. 9:27.-“And Jehu ... said, Smite him also in the chariot, and they
did so,” i.e., “And [they smote him] at the going up to Gur.”

1Ch. 2:23.-“All these belonged to the sons of Machir, the father of
Gilead.”

Here the Ellipsis is arbitrarily supplied in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] by
introducing a new word into the text. The verb “took” must be repeated
from the preceding clause, and not the verb “belonged” brought in
from nowhere:-“And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair,
from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even threescore cities.
All these [fook] the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.”

Neh. 5:4.-“There were also that said, We have borrowed money for
the king’s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.”

Here the words “we have mortgaged’ must be repeated from verse
3. Thus:-“There were also some that said, We have borrowed money
for the king’s tribute, [we have mortgaged] our lands and vineyards.”
Ecc. 10:1.-Here the Ellipsis is supplied by the words “so doth.” But it is
better to repeat the verb, thus:-“As dead flies cause the ointment of
the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so a little folly [causeth]
him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour [fo send forth an
offensive odour).”

Isa. 8:19-20.-“And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that
have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
should not a people seek unto their God? for [should] the living [seek
unto] to the dead? To the Law and to the Testimony: if they speak not
according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

Amo. 6:12.-“Shall horses run upon a rock? will one plow there with
oxen?” i.e., “Shall horses run upon a rock? will a husbandman plow [a
rock] with oxen?”

Mar. 12:5.-“And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
others [whom he sent, and they used them shametully, from verse 4],
beating some, and killing some.”

Mar. 14:29.-“Although all shall be offended, yet will not | [be
offended].”

Luk. 22:37.-“For | say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
accomplished in me, And he was reckoned amongst the
transgressors: for the things [written] concerning me have an end.”
This was the last prophecy written of Him which was to be fulfilled
before His betrayal, so He now abrogated a precept, necessary at the
presentation of Himself, but no longer necessary now that He had
been rejected, and was about to die. Now, therefore, they might not
only carry a sword, but buy one. So that He was only “reckoned” by
man among the transgressors.

Joh. 15:4.-“No more can ye, except ye abide in me,” {6., “No more
can ye [bear fruit] except ye abide in me” (see above, pages 12, 13).
Rom. 1:12.-‘That is, that | may be comforted together with you.” The
verse begins in the Greek, τοῦτο δέ ἐστι (touto de esti), but this is. The
verse reads, “But this [imparting to you some spiritual giff] is (or
means) our being jointly comforted by our mutual faith.” He refers to
his desire to see these saints in Rome, and the verb is repeated from
verse 11, “For | long to see you.”

Rom. 7:24-25.-“O wretched man that | am! who shall deliver me from
the body of this death? | thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

The sense in this last clause is manifestly incomplete as an
answer to the previous question. Following the most approved
reading, instead of “I thank God,” we take the more ancient words,
“Thanks be to God,” [Note: Through not noticing the Ellipsis, attempts
have been made from the earliest times to get sense by altering the
text. The T.R. has 2ὐ222222ῶ 2ῷ 22ῷ, with Griesbach, Scholz, and A
К L P a. But 222322 ?@ 22ῷ Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf,
Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort, and R.V. Also the Vatican ms.
Others read, “But thanks be to God,” and others, “It is the grace of
God” (DE), and others, “It is the grace of the Lord” (FG).] and repeat
the words from verse 24, thus:-“Who shall deliver me from the body of
this death? Thanks be to God, [He will deliver me] through Jesus
Christ our Lord.”

The deliverance here desired is from the conflict between the old
nature and the new, the flesh and the spirit.t [Note: It is to be noted
that “spirit” with a small “s” is one of the names given to the new
nature which is implanted in every believer who is born again of the
Holy Spirit; and this term “spirit” is to be distinguished from the Person
of the Holy Spirit, from the context as well as from the absence of the
article. Even in Rom. 8:1-15, the Person of the Holy Spirit is not
mentioned. Not until verse 16, “spirit of God” in 8:9 and 14 is divine
spirit, 1.е., “divine nature” (2Pe. 1:4), “spirit of Christ” (8:9) is Pueuma-
Christou, Christ-Spirit, another term for the new nature. So, “spirit of
adoption” (verse 15) is “sonship-spirit,” and “the spirit of Him” (verse
11) is “the new nature [given by] Him who raised up,” &c.]

But as the flesh is bound up with this “body of death,” i.e., this
dying body, this mortal body, there is no deliverance except either
through death and resurrection, or through that “change” which shall
take place at the coming of Christ.

The old heart is not changed or taken away, but a new heart is
given, and these two are contrary the one to the other. They remain
together, and must remain until God shall “deliver” us from the burden
of this sinful flesh-this mortal body-by a glorious resurrection like unto
Christ's. This deliverance is further described in 8:11 and 23; and it is
“through Jesus” that our mortal bodies shall be raised again. See 1Th.
4:14, διὰ Ἰησοῦ (dia leesou), “by means of Jesus,” and 1Th. 5:9 : “God
hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation ({6., full
deliverance from this body of sin and death) by (i.e., by means of, or
through) our Lord Jesus Christ.”
See this passage under the Figures of Metonymy, Hypallage,
Ecphonesis, and Erotesis.
Rom. 8:19-21 may be explained thus:-
Expectation.
Α 19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God.

The Reason.

В 20-. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the
same:

Expectation.
А -20. [Waiteth, | say (from verse 19)] in hope,

The Reason.

Β 21. Because the creature itself shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
children of God.

Here, A, corresponding with A, shows us that we are to repeat in
the latter member, A, the verb used in the former, A; the subject of
each member being the same.
Rom. 8:33.-“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? /t is
God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? /t is Christ that died.”

We have to remember that, while only the greater pauses are
indicated in the ancient manuscripts, there is no authority for the minor
interpunctuation. This can generally be accurately gathered by the
devout student of the context. Here it is probable that the questions
ought to be repeated:-“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s
elect? [Shall] God who justifieth [them]? Who is he that condemneth
[them]? [/s if] Christ who died [for them]? Yea, rather; that is risen
again, etc.”
1Co. 4:15.-“For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet
have ye not many fathers.”

Here the verb “ye have’ is correctly repeated in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
1Co. 15:23.-“But every man [shall be made alive (from verse 22)] in
his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at
his coming. Then the end,” i.e., not “then cometh the end,” for τὸ τέλος
(to telos) is used of the last company of a body of soldiers.* [Note:
Hom. ΙΙ. 7, 380; 10, 470, etc.] τὸ τέλος (to telos) is the end: but of
what, or what end, can be determined only by the context. Here the
subject is the various bodies τάγματα (tagmata) ranks, i.e., every man
in his own proper band. Of these bands or ranks Christ is first; then
they that are Christ’s at His coming; then the last of these bands at the
end of the thousand years (Rev. 20:5), when Christ shall deliver up the
kingdom.

The second of these is not the resurrection foretold in 1Th. 4:16,
as the privilege of those who are “in Christ,” but the “first” of the two
resurrections referred to in the Old Testament, the Gospels, and the
Apocalypse.
2Co. 1:6.-“And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation.”

Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] supplies the verb substantive. It is better to
repeat the verb “[we are afflicted] for your consolation.”
2Co. 3:11.-“For if that which is done away was glorious, much more
that which remaineth is glorious.”

Here the two words διὰ δόξης (dia doxees), by means of glory, and
ἐν ббёл (en doxee), in glory, are both translated by the same word,
“glorious,” while the verb substantive (“was” and “is”) is thus
necessarily, though incorrectly, supplied. The R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] renders the verse, “For if that which passeth away
(margin, is being done away) was with glory, much more that which
remaineth is in glory.”

But, if we repeat the verbs already used by the Holy Spirit, we can
take the Greek literally:-“For if that which is done away [is done away]
by glory (see verse 10), much more that which remaineth, [remaineth]
in glory.”
2Co. 12:2.-“Such an one [/ knew] caught up, etc.”

The verb ἁρπάζω (harpaz6) does not necessarily mean that the
catching is “up,” but rather “away.” In Mat. 11:12. Joh. 6:15. Act. 23:10
it is rendered take by force. In Mat. 13:19. Act. 8:39 it is catch away. In
Joh. 10:12 it is rendered “catch”; in Joh. 10:28-29, it is “pluck”; while in
Jud. 1:23 it is pull.

See also Eze. 8:3. Rev. 1:10. “Such an one [/ knew] caught away:”
and this either with reference to place or time, i.e., caught away to
some present place (Act. 8:39-40), or to a vision of some future time
(as in Eze. 8:3. Rev. 1:10; Rev. 4:2, etc.).

Gal. 2:7.-“The gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me,
as the gospel of the circumcision was [committed] unto Peter.”

Gal. 5:17.-“For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other, so that
ye cannot do the things that ye would.”

Here the word ἐπιθυμέω (epithumed) is connected with κατά
(kata), against, i.e., to desire that which is against, or contrary to. The
same verb is used both of the flesh and of the spirit ({6., the new
nature), and the Ellipsis of the verb with reference to the latter enables
it to be used in its bad sense with regard to the flesh and in a good
sense with regard to the spirit:-“For the flesh desires that which is
against the spirit, and the spirit desires that which is against the flesh;
and these desires are contrary to one another, so that ye cannot do
the things that ye would,” {Θ., so that your new nature is hindered
ofttimes in doing those good things that ye would, and, thank God,
your old nature is also hindered from doing the things which it lusts
after.

Eph. 1:13.-“In whom ye also trusted.” Here the verb is repeated from
verse 12: but it seems rather that another verb should be repeated,
from verse 11: “In whom ye also were allotted as God’s own
inheritance,” for it is the inheritance which is the subject of the context
and not the matter of trusting.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] neither sees, nor
supplies the Ellipsis, treating it as an Anacoluthon (q.v. [Note: Which
see] ).

Eph. 4:22.-We must repeat from verse 17, “[/ say also] that ye put off
concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts.”

1Th. 2:11.-“Ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged
every one of you, as a father doth his children.”

Here all three verbs are to be understood, /е., “as a father
[exhorteth, and comforteth, and chargeth] his children.” (See under
Polysyndeton).

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] better preserves the
order of the Greek, supplying and treating the Ellipsis as absolute. “As
ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own
children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, etc.”
1Th. 4:14.-“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”

Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] :-“Even so them also that
are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”

The two clauses of this verse, as they are thus translated, are so
inconsequent that the passage has been a source of difficulty to many,
and is practically unintelligible. When this is the case we must ask
whether there is a figure employed, and, if so, what it is. Here it can be
only the figure Ellipsis. But what are the omitted words, which if
supplied will cause the passage to yield sense as to teaching, and
completeness as to structure?
Before we can answer this question we must institute an enquiry
into the usage of the word translated “even:” as this is the key that will
open this lock, besides explaining and throwing light on many other
passages. The word “even” here is καί (kai), and καί (ka/) is the
ordinary conjunction, and, which has two distinct senses, (1) and, (2)
also or even. It is the latter of these with which we are now concerned.
It is a matter of great importance that we should always know what is
the word which it emphasizes. In the Greek, this is never in doubt.*
[Note: Nor is it in the Hebrew, as the @ is always joined to and forms
part of the word with which it is connected.] But in English literature,
including both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] ‚ its usage is very inconsistent and defective. In the Greek, kai,
when it means also, is always placed immediately before the word
which it emphasizes; while in English usage it may be placed either
before or after the word. When we add to this that both in the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] it is often
dissociated altogether from this word, the confusion and ambiguity can
be imagined.

The word kai is used in the sense of also some 636 times in the
New Testament.t [Note: See a pamphlet on the usage of the word
“Also” in the New Testament, by the same author and publisher.]

In 258 of these it is placed (in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) after the word.

In 275 it is placed before the word, or in connection with another
word to which it does not belong.

In 60 places it is not translated at all.

In 43 places it is rendered even, and placed before the word.

Sometimes the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] agree in this, and sometimes they differ.

Now, remembering that the English word “also” must immediately
follow the word which it emphasizes, we ask what is that word here
(1Th. 4:14)? As the Greek stands, it reads, “If we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so them which sleep in Jesus, GOD also
will bring with him.” But this yields no intelligible meaning. The hope
that is mentioned in the second clause cannot be conditioned on our
belief of the fact stated in the former clause.

But notice, before we proceed, that the preposition διά (dia), when
it governs the genitive case, as it does here, denotes agency, and is
rendered “by” 235 times, “through” 87 times, etc.; but “in” only 8 times.
See its use in the very next chapter (1Th. 5:9), “We are appointed to
obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ” (διὰ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ
Χριστοῦ); Rom. 7:25, “1 thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord” (διὰ
Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ); Rom. 5:9, “We shall be saved from wrath through
him” (δι ’ αὐτοῦ). No wonder therefore that the Π.Ν. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] , while translating it here “in Jesus,” says in
the margin, “Greek, through,” and adds the alternative rendering, “Will
God through Jesus bring.”

The one thought and subject is Resurrection, as the great and
blessed hope of the Lord’s people. The three clauses are perfectly
balanced, as will be seen in the following structure of verse 14:-

а If we believe (Belief)

b that Jesus died (Death)
с and rose again, (Resurrection)

а — п №е manner [we believe] also (Belief)

Ь — That them which are asleep (Death)
ο will God (by Jesus) bring with Him [from the dead].
(Resurrection).

Here in a and a we have the statement of our belief, in b and b we
have death (in b the death of Jesus, and in b the death of His saints),
while in c and c we have resurrection (in c the resurrection of Jesus by
God, and in c the resurrection of His people by God), but in an
explanatory parenthesis it is explained that the Lord Jesus will be the
agent, as the context goes on to show (see Joh. 5:21; Joh. 11:25;
Joh. 11:43). It was God who brought Jesus from the dead (Heb.
13:20). In like manner will He-by Jesus-bring His people from the
dead.

Hence, we must repeat the verb “we believe” from the first clause:
“If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, in like manner [we
believe] also that God will, through Jesus, bring, with Him, them that
are fallen asleep.”

This is the scope of the passage, which immediately goes on to
explain how this will be accomplished. We have the same hope
presented in the same manner in Rom. 6:5; Rom. 8:11. 2Co. 4:14,
viz., that Resurrection and Advent are the only hope of mourning
saints.

Heb. 3:15.-“While it is said, To-day, etc.” (So R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ). The Greek is “ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι, Σήµερον,” “in (or by)
its being said, To-day.”

The simplest solution of this confessedly difficult passage is to
repeat the exhortation from verse 13: “[As ye are exhorted] by the
saying, To-day, etc.”

Heb. 4:7.-“Again [seeing] he limiteth,” from verse 6.

Heb. 4:10.-“For he that hath entered into his rest, he himself also hath
rested from his works, as God [rested] from his.”

Heb. 7:8.-“And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth
them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.”

The reference is clearly to Melchisedec, and it is not testified of
him that he now liveth. In Psa. 110:4 it is testified of Christ, “Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.” That which marked “the
order of Melchisedec” as being different from “the order of Aaron” was
the fact that the days of Aaron’s order of priesthood began at 30 years
of age, and ended at the age of 50 years, whereas the days of
Melchisedec’s had neither such a beginning nor such a limitation: his
priesthood had “neither beginning of days nor end of life,” but he
remained a priest continually, ie., all his life (7:3). εἰς τὸ διηνεκές (eis
to dieenekes) means for a continuance, the duration being determined
by the nature of the context.
In chap. 7:1 it must mean that Melchisedec remained a priest all
his life; in chap. 10:1 it must mean that the sacrifices were continually
offered until the end of the Mosaic dispensation; in 10:12 it means that
the one sacrifice of Christ is efficacious in perpetuity (or, with
Macknight, that Christ offered only one sacrifice during His whole life);
while in chap. 10:14 it means that the perfection arising from this
sacrifice is limited only by the life of those who are sanctified.
Hence, here in 7:8 the Ellipsis may be thus supplied:-“And here
men that die receive tithes; but there [a man received them] of whom it
is testified that he lived [a priest all his life.]’* [Note: The present tense
is here (as is often the case) put (by the figure of Enallage (q.v.), or
“Exchange’) for the preterite as in Act. 9:26), not believing that he is a
disciple (1.6., was); Heb. 7:3, he remaineth (i.e., remained); Mar. 5:15,
they come and see (1.6., came and saw); Joh. 1:29, John seeth (i.e.,
saw), Joh. 1:46, Philip findeth and saith (1.Θ., found and said); Joh.
9:13, they bring him (1.Θ., they brought), etc., etc. In all such cases the
figure of Enallage marks the action which is thus emphasized.]

As Melchisedec was a priest all the days of his life, and his was a
mortal life; so Christ was a Priest after the same order; and therefore,
as His life is eternal, and has no limit, His priesthood (unlike that of
Aaron’s) must also be without limit, and He is “a priest for ever.”

Heb. 12:25.-“See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they
escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall
not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.”
Here the words are correctly repeated from what precedes.

2Pe. 1:19.-“We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise; [taking heed, | say] in
your hearts.”

It cannot be that we are to take heed until we are illuminated by
God’s Spirit, or until we are converted! but that we are to take heed to
the word of prophecy in our hearts; for it is like a light shining in a dark
place. A light is for our eyes to see, and for our feet to use, but the
prophetic word is for our hearts to be exercised with. This is contrary
to popular theology. This word declares that the world is the “dark
place,” and prophecy is the only light we have in it, to which we do
well that we take heed. Popular theology says that prophecy is the
“dark place,” and we “do well” to avoid it!
1Jn. 3:10.-“Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not [born] of God,”
from verse 9. So also verse 12, “Not as Cain, who was [born] of that
wicked one.” Also verse 19, “We know that we are [born] of the truth.”
2Jn. 1:2.-“[Loving you] for the truth’s sake,” from verse 1.
2Jn. 1:12.-“Having many things to write unto you, | would not write
with paper and ink.”

Rev. 19:10.-“And | fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
See thou do it not,” i.e., “See [thou worship me] not.”
(c) Where an omitted Particle is to be repeated from the
preceding clause
(i.) Negatives

The negative is frequently omitted; and is generally supplied in the
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
Deu. 33:6.-“Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.”
1Sa. 2:3.-“Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come
out of your mouth.”
1К!. 2:9.-“Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise
man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
head bring thou down to the grave with blood.”
This has been a favourite text with “those that oppose themselves”
(2Ti. 2:25). Misunderstanding the phrase, where David is called “a
man after God’s own heart” (as though it referred to David’s character,
instead of to David’s calling, being chosen by God and not, as Saul
was, by man), infidels have pointed to 1Ki. 2:9 to show David’s
faithless and bloodthirsty character! But if, as in so many other cases,
we repeat the negative from the preceding clause, there is no such
difficulty: “but his hoar head bring thou [nof] down to the grave with
blood.”

True, Solomon did put Shimei to death, but this was for quite
another reason, and as Solomon said, Shimei’s blood was upon his
own head (verse 37).

Thus the passage is brought into agreement with David’s oath to
Shimei, which is repeated in immediate connection with this verse
(verse 8 from 2Sa. 19:23).

Psa. 9:18.-“For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the
expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.”

Here the negative is supplied by the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in italics.

Psa. 38:1.-“O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: and chasten me [nof]
in thy hot displeasure.”
Psa. 75:5.-“Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.”

Here the negative is supplied, as it is in many passages.
Pro. 25:27.-ЧЁ is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search
their own glory is not glory.”
Isa. 38:18.-“For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
thee.”

It is open to question whether
Gen. 2:6 is one of these cases. The three verses 4-6 describe the
condition of the earth before the creation of man (verse 7), and before
the plants and herbs of the field grew. (Compare verses 4 and 9).
Then three negative reasons are given why these did not grow:-(1)
“For (rin) the Lord God had not (Ма) caused it to rain upon the
earth, (2) апа (©) there was a man nowhere (ane) to till the ground,
(3) and (68) [no] mist went up to water the whole face of the ground.”

(ii.) Interrogatives
МОД (lammah). Why?
Psa. 2:1-2.-“Why do the heathen rage, and [why do] the people
imagine a vain thing? [Why do] the kings of the earth set themselves,
and [why do] the rulers take counsel together?”

Psa. 10:1.-Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] repeats it: “Why (МОД) standest
thou afar off, О Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?”

ЛОД (kammah). How oft?

Job. 21:17.-“How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
cometh their destruction upon them!” Here the words “how off’ are
correctly repeated in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] But why not repeat them also
in the following sentences, instead of supplying the word “God,” and
translate thus: “[How off] He distributeth sorrows in His anger! [How
off] are they as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away! [How off] God layeth up calamity for his (i.e., the wicked
man’s) children.* [Note: The R.V., missing the proper Ellipsis,
arbitrarily introduces the words “Ye say, God layeth up iniquity for his
children,” taking the words as the words of the wicked man instead of
the children!] He recompenseth him and he shall know it; his eyes
shall see his destruction, and he shall drink the wrath of the Almighty.”
айк (eykh). How?
Psa. 73:19.-“How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!
they are utterly consumed with terrors.” But it is better to repeat the
word “how”:-“How are they utterly consumed with terror!”
айлд (eykah). How!

An exclamation of pain and grief “How!” This gives its title to the
book of Lamentations in the Hebrew Canont [Note: The title in the
English Version is from the Latin Vulgate. See The Names and Order
of the Books of the Old Testament, by the same author and publisher.]
“Eykah.”

Three prophets use this word of Israel:-Moses uses it of Israel in
his glory and pride (Deu. 1:12): Isaiah, of Jerusalem in her dissipation
(Isa. 1:21): and Jeremiah, of Jerusalem in her desolation (Lam. 1:1,
etc.).

Hence, the word very frequently occurs in the book of

Lamentations; and its Ellipsis or omission is frequently to be supplied
by repetition. In many cases this is done in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] Note,
for example:-
Lam. 1:1-2.-“How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and
princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary! 2. [How]
she weepeth sore in the night,” etc. 3. [How] is Judah gone into
captivity ... 4. [How] the ways of Zion do mourn.”
See also 2:1, 2, etc.; 4:1, 4, 8, 10.
ОД (mah). How!
Joe. 1:18.-“How (Ο/1) do the beasts groan! [How] are the herds of
cattle perplexed!”
TrOog (ad-meh). How long?
Psa. 4:3.-“O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into
shame? how long will ye love vanity?”

Here the interrogative is repeated, but why not repeat it again
instead of supplying the word “and’? Thus:-“[How Jong] will ye seek
after leasing?”

Psa. 89:46.-“How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? [How
long, Lord] shall thy wrath burn like fire?”

TrOobn (ad-mahthai). How long?
Psa. 94:3-4.-“Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the
wicked triumph? How long shall they utter and speak hard things?
[How long] shall all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?”
(d) Where the omission of Connected Words is to be supplied by
repeating them out of a preceding clause

This form of Ellipsis, though it is very clear, is not always supplied in

the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English

Bible, 1611.]

Num. 26:3-4.-“And Moses ... spake ... saying, Take the sum of the

people, from twenty years old and upward,” which words are correctly

repeated from verse 2.

Jos. 24:19.-“And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the

Lord: for he is an holy God,” etc.

The words must be supplied from verses 14-16: see also verses
20, 23. Thus:-“Ye cannot serve the Lord [unless ye put away your
idols], for he is a holy God,” etc.

Psa. 84:3.-“Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a
nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
Lord of hosts, my King and my God.”
There is evidently a figure here: for in what way could birds build
nests and lay young in the altars of God? The one was covered over
with brazen plates, with fires perpetually burning and sacrifices
continually being offered upon it; the other was overlaid with gold, and
was within the Holy Place! The question therefore is, What is the kind
of figure here? It is the figure of Ellipsis, which the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have made worse by
inserting the word “even” (the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] in italic type, the R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] in Roman). It must be correctly supplied
by repeating the words from the preceding clause: “so hath my soul
found thy altars, О Lord of hosts,” i.e., as the birds find, and love, and
use their house, so / find and love Thy house, my King and my God.

If we observe the structure of the passage,* [Note: See Key to the
Psalms, p. 79. Edited by the same author.] we see how this supply of
the Ellipsis is necessitated:-

а — 1. How amiable are thy tabernacles, О Lord of hosts!

b 2. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
ο 3. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house,
с — апа the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay
her young,
Ь even thine altars, О Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
а — 4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
praising thee. Selah.
This structure at once puts c and c practically in a parenthesis, and
b and b may be read on literally and connectedly without a break, and
without any apparent Ellipsis; thus:-
b 2. My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God,
Ь even thine altars, О Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
But Ь read after ο must have the Ellipsis supplied:-“The sparrow
hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself ... [so have /
found] thine altars, O Lord of hosts.”
Pro. 21:1.-“The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of
water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.”
Here the second sentence is manifestly incomplete. There is a
subject, but there is no verb, and no object, as will be seen if we
present it in this way:-
Subject. Verb. Object.

The King’s heart as the rivers of water
is ..

in the hand of the Lord. ...

It is clear from this that we have to supply both the verb and the
predicate in the latter sentence. What they are to be will be seen more
clearly when we translate the other words more correctly.

The expression “rivers of water” is in the Hebrew CbMBNOONH
(palgey mayim). Palgey means divisions of, and is the plural construct
of Φμβ (palag), to divide.t [Note: cbMB (palag), to divide, occurs
only in Gen. 10:25. 1Ch. 1:19. “In his days was the earth divided.” Job.
38:25, “Who hath divided a watercourse,” and Psa. 55:9. “Destroy
their tongues and divide them.”] The name of the Patriarch Peleg (i.e.,
division) was so called “because in his days was the earth divided”
(Gen. 10:25). The term palgey mayim* [Note: The word is used of any
very small artificial channel. The following are all the occurrences:-

Job. 29:6. The rock poured me out rivers of oil.

Psa. 1:3. Like a tree planted by the rivers of water.

Psa. 46:4. A river the streams whereof shall make glad.

Psa. 65:9. Enrichest it with the river of God.

Psa. 119:136. Rivers of waters run down mine eyes.
Pro. 5:16. (And) rivers of waters in the streets.

Isa. 30:25. Rivers and streams of waters.

Isa. 32:2. As rivers of water in a dry place.

Lam. 3:48. Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water.] is the
technical term for the little channels, or gullies, of water which divide
the Eastern garden into small squares of about 12 feet each, for
purposes of irrigation. Hence the word is used for any little channel by
which the water is distributed or divided, especially the channels which
divide-up a garden. It is used also of the trickling of tears. In Psa. 1:3,
the man who meditates in the law of God is like a tree planted by the
palgey mayim, i.e., in a garden, where it will have a sure supply of
water and the constant care of the gardener! Not left out in the plain to
shift for itself; to thrive if it gets water, and to die if it does not!

These little channels were filled by the gardener with water from
the spring, or well, or fountain, which every Eastern garden must
possess; and then the water was sent first into one channel, then into
another, by the simple movement of his foot: “the land whither thou
goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt from whence ye
came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot,
as a garden of herbs” (Deu. 11:10). The gardener did not deign to use
a tool, or to stoop down and use his hands. By simply moving the foot
he dammed up one little stream, or by a similar movement he
released the water in another.

Now we are able to supply the Ellipsis correctly in this verse:-

“The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the palgey mayim
[are in the hand of the gardener): He turneth it whithersoever He will.”

To an Eastern mind this would be perfectly clear without the supply
of the Ellipsis. Just as in England the expression, “A coach and four” is
perfectly clear, and the supply of the Ellipsis “horses” is wholly
unnecessary. But an Esquimaux or a South Sea Islander, or an Arab,
would ask, “A coach and four what?” It would be unintelligible to him,
while with us it needs no explanation.

So when we learn and understand the customs and peculiarities of
the East we can often supply the Ellipsis from such knowledge, as
Easterns would supply it naturally.

The teaching of the passage then is that just as the little channels
of water in a garden are turned about by the gardener by the simple
movement of his foot, so the king’s heart is as easily turned about by
the Lord, “whithersoever He wills.”
Oh how full of comfort for ourselves, for our friends, for our
children, to know this, and to be assured of it! “On that night could not
the king sleep” (Est. 6:1). A sleepless night! The king’s heart turned-
the law of the Medes and Persians reversed-and Israel delivered. Oh
how simple! Let us never again limit His almighty power-for it is
almighty power that is required to turn the heart of man. We know how
difficult it is to convince even a friend on the simplest matter of fact.
But let us remember that the heart of even an Eastern despot is as
easily turned by the Lord’s mighty hand as the palgai mayim are
turned by the simple movement of a gardener’s foot.

Job. 3:23.-“Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom
God hath hedged in?”
Here the words, “why is light given,” are correctly repeated from
verse 20. This expression about giving light is similar to that of “seeing
the sun” (6:5, and 7:5). Both are idioms (α.ν. [Note: Which 5εε.] ) for
living or being alive, as is clear from verses 20, 21. “Wherefore is light
given,” i.e., why is life prolonged, in the case of those who are in
misery and long for death?

The latter part of the verse may be cleared by noting that the word
“hid,” as applied to “a way,” differs from that in Psa. 2:12. In Psa. 2:12
aor (avad) is to lose a way which is already known. Here, it is СЪШ
(sathar) which implies that the way is not known at all. It hides itself. In
this case God has hidden it and it cannot be found.

What good is life, Job complains, to a man if God has completely
covered up the way? The word СЛК (sakak), rendered “hedged in,”
refers to the way, not to the man, and means, not “hedged in,” but
covered up (see 38:8). It is not the same word as 1:10 (which is μίθκ
(sook), to hedge in), nor as 19:8, as indicated in the margin (which is
BFLL (gadar) to fence up).

Ecc. 7:11-12 has evidently given some trouble, as is clear from the
italics in Text and margin both of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,
or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.]

“Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun.” Margin, “as good as an inheritance, yea, better
too.”

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] reads:-“Wisdom is as
good as an inheritance: yea, more excellent is it for them that see the
sun.” Margin, “is good together with an inheritance: and profitable unto
them,” etc.

We must take TH (im), with, in its idea of accompaniment, in
common with, i.e., like or as (see Gen. 18:23; Gen. 18:25. Job.
3:14-15; Job. 9:26; Job. 21:8; Job. 40:15. Psa. 73:5; Psa. 73:25; Psa.
143:7. Ecc. 2:16), and translate:-

“Wisdom is good, as an inheritance is good, and more excellent to
them that see the sun” (i.e., for living men, see above under Job.
3:23). For to be in (6; b, which is ignored by A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) the shelter (LIM, tze/, Gen.
19:8; Num. 14:9; Psa. 17:9) of wisdom [is more excellent than to be]
under the shelter (6) of money; and the advantage of wisdom is that
wisdom preserveth the life of them that possess it.”

That is to say, briefly, wisdom is good: and money is good, but

wisdom has this advantage over money; it can preserve life, while an
inheritance or money cannot.
Zec. 14:18.-The verse reads in the Hebrew (see margin):-“And if the
family of Egypt go not up, and come not, not upon them there shall be
the plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up
to keep the feast of tabernacles.”
Here, there is evidently a figure: because, read with verse 17,
there is not only no sense, but quite an opposite sense to that which is
clearly intended. Our duty is to ask, What is the figure? For we are not
at liberty to suggest an alteration of the Text, or to make even a free
translation of it. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] resorts
to the easy method of suggesting in the margin: “The text is probably
corrupt.” This is a very common practice of commentators! It never
seems to enter their heads that the difficulty lies with themselves. It
would have been more becoming to have said, “Our understandings
are probably at fault’! The Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]

arbitrarily inserts words, as does the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , and even then
both Versions fail to make sense.

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] says: “That have no rain” (marg. [Note: arg.
Margin.] ‚ “upon whom there is ποῦ).

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] : “Neither shail it be
upon them” (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , “shall there not be upon them
the plague?’ etc.).

The Ellipsis is Correctly and simply supplied by repeating “there
shall be no rain” from the preceding clause: which, describing
millennial days, says:-

“Whoso will not come up of а/ the families of the earth unto
Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them
shall be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not,
not upon them [shall there be no гат];* [Note: Because Egypt has no
rain, as it is, and is therefore thus excepted here.] there shall be the
plague, [aforesaid, verse 12] wherewith the Lord will smite the
heathen that come not up to the feast of tabernacles.”

Mat. 2:10.-“When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
great joy:” i.e., “When they saw the star [standing over where the
young child was], they rejoiced.” The words are to be repeated from
verse 9.

Mat. 13:32.-“Which indeed is the least of all seeds [which a man takes
and sows in a field];” from verse 31; i.e., not the least, absolutely, but
relatively, as to those seeds which are usually sown in the field.

Mar. 5:23.-“And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth
at the point of death: / pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that
she may be healed.”

Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] adds: “/ pray thee,” but it is better to repeat the
verb from the beginning of the verse, and then we may take the other
words literally:-“! beseech thee earnestly that having come thou
wouldest lay on her thy hands,” etc.

Joh. 1:18.-“No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten
Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.” Here
the sense is to be completed by repeating the words from the
preceding clause, thus: “No man hath seen God at any time; the only
begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath [seen God,
and] declared [the Father].”

Joh. 9:3.-Here the Ellipsis is to be supplied from verse 2. “Neither
hath this man sinned, nor his parents [that he should be born blind]:
but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.” See below
(page 107).

Rom. 4:12.-“And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
circumcision,” etc.
Here the words are to be repeated from the preceding
clause:-“And the father of the circumcision [that righteousness might
be imputed] to them who are not of the circumcision only, but also
walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had
being yet uncircumcised.”

Rom. 5:3.-“And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also,” i.e., “And
not only do we [rejoice in hope of the glory of God], but we glory also
in tribulations.”* [Note: In the Greek the emphasis is on the verb
“glory.” “We GLORY also in tribulations,” i.e., we not only have them
like all other people, but by grace we are able to glory in them. For the
usage of the word “also” see page 90.]

Rom. 5:11.-“And not only so:” i.e., “And not only [are we saved from
wrath through him], but we alsot [Note: In the Greek the emphasis is
on the word “joy.” “We JOY also in God.” See a pamphlet on the
biblical usage of the word Also, by the same author and publisher.]
joy in God [as our God] through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we
have now received the reconciliation.”

It is at this point that the great doctrinal portion of Romans divides
into two portions. It runs from 1:16 to 8:39. Up to 5:11 the subject is
“sins”: from verse 12 it is “sin.” Up to this point the subject is the
products of the old nature: from this point it is the old nature itself. Up
to 5:11 it is the fruits of the old tree: from 5:12 it is the old tree itself. Up
to this point we are considered as “in the flesh”: from this point we are
considered as “not in the flesh,” but the flesh is in us. [Note: See
further, on this, a series of articles in Things to Come commencing
September, 1898.]

Rom. 7:7.-“What shall we say then? [that] the law [ἱ5] sin? God forbid!
Nay, | had not known sin but by (or through) the law; for | had not
known lust [fo be sin] except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
But [/ say that] (from verse 7) sin taking occasion by the
commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence (or
desire). For without the law sin [is] dead.”

Rom. 8:23.-“And not only they,” i.e., “And not only [every creature
groaneth], but ourselves also,” etc.

Rom. 9:10.-“And not only this,” i.e., “And not only [was there that
limitation of the promise to this son], but when Rebecca also had
conceived [twins] by one, even by our father Isaac ... it was said unto
her, The elder shall serve the younger.”

Rom. 10:8.-“But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy
mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach [is
nigh thee].”

1Co. 15:42.-“So also is the resurrection of the dead.” Here instead of
using the verb substantive we must repeat the words from verses 37
and 41, and then we can preserve the proper emphasis shown by the
position of kai “also”:-“So the RESURRECTION also of the dead [is
with a different body.” This preserves the harmony of the whole
argument.

2Co. 8:19.-“And not that only,” i.e., “And not only [is his praise
throughout all the churches], but he was chosen* [Note: In the Greek
the emphasis is on the word “chosen”:-“CHOSEN also.”] also of the
churches to travel with us with this grace (or gift),” etc.
Col. 3:4.-“When Christ, who is our life, shall appear.” It is a question
whether this Ellipsis should be supplied (as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ) by the verb substantive, or
whether the words should be repeated from the preceding verse,
“When Christ, [with whom] our life [is hid], shall appear, then shall ye
also appear with him in glory.” Many ancient MSS., with Lachmann
(margin), Tischendorf, Tregelles, R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] margin, read “your life.”

2Ti. 1:7.-“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power,
and of love, and of a sound mind.”

Here, by way of contrast, the words are to be repeated in the
second clause: “but [God hath given to us the spirit] of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.”

More properly it should be “a” spirit, not “the spirit,” and the fact
that a noun is used (by the figure of Enallage, q.v. [Note: Which see_] )
instead of an adjective, shows us that the emphasis is to be placed on
the adjective. “a COWARDLY spirit,” πνεῦμα δειλίας (рпеита deilias);
δειλίας (deilias), means timidity, fearfulness, cowardice, and always in
a bad sense (see the verb δειλιάω (deiliad), Joh. 14:27. The adjective,
Mat. 8:26. Mar. 4:40. Rev. 21:8).
1Jn. 2:19.-Here the Ellipsis is correctly supplied in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “they
went out.”
1Jn. 5:15.-“And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask
[according to his will], we know that we have the petitions that we
desired of him.”

Here the words, “according to His will,” are to be supplied from the
preceding verse.
2. Where the omitted word is to be supplied out of a Succeeding

Clause

Jos. 3:3.-“When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God,
and the priests the Levites bearing it [going before], then ye shall
remove from your place, and go after it.”

Here the words “going before” are necessitated, and are to be
supplied from the words that follow-“go after.”
Jdg. 16:13-14.-“If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the
web, [and fastenest them with a pin in the beam (from verse 14), then
shall | be weak and be as another man (from verses 7 and 11)]: and
she fastened it with the pin, etc.” The Arabic and Vulgate Versions
supply these words to complete the sense. See Appendix C.
Homeeoteleuton, where it is shown that this is not really an Ellipsis,
but an ancient omission on the part of some scribe.
1Sa. 16:7.-“The Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance,
or on the height of his stature; because | have refused him: for the
LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward
appearance (Heb. on the eyes), but the Lord looketh on the heart.”
Here the verb “seeth” is correctly repeated from the succeeding
clause. It is not necessary to repeat “the Lord,” though it is true, and
greatly beautifies the English. It may be simply “for it is not as man
seeth,” or, “for / see not as man seeth,” which comes to the same
thing.
1К!. 3:12.-“Lo, | have given thee a wise and understanding heart; so
that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any
arise like unto thee,” i.e., among the kings, which words follow in verse
13. See also 10:23.
1К!. 14:15.-“For the Lord shall smite Israel, [shaking him] as a reed is
shaken in the water.”
1Ch. 4:7.-“And the sons of Helah were, Zereth, and Jezoar, and
Ethnan, [and Coz]”: supply from verse 8.
So, at the end of verse 13 supply “Meonotha/’ from verse 14.
Also, in chap. vi., at end of verse 27, supply “Samuel his son“from
verse 28.* [Note: In this verse there is a strange confusion. Samuel’s
or Shemue''s firstborn was Joel, see verse 33. Vashni (CLU6LU) is
not a proper name, but means “the second.” And the verse reads,
“And the sons of Samuel, the firstborn [Joel, verse 33], the second
Abiah.” See 1Sa. 8:2, and see also above, page 5.]

In chap. vii. at end of verse 18 supply “and Shemidah” from verse
19.

In chap. viii. at end of verse 7 add “and Shaharaim” from verse 8.

In chap. xxv. at end of verse 3 add “and Shime/’ from verse 17,
where he is named. In verse 3 only five out of the six are named. In
the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] Shimei’s
name is supplied in the margin.

Neh. 5:2.-“For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,
[being] many, [are mortgaged],” supply from verses 3, 4, 5.

Job. 20:17.-Here the word “floods” means, as in the margin and R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , streaming or flowing, and
belongs to the word “brooks.” But it must be repeated also before the
word rivers, thus:-“He shall not see the flowing rivers, the flowing
brooks of honey and butter.”
Job. 38:19.-The Ellipsis is to be supplied thus:-“Where is the way [to
the place where] light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the
place thereof?”
Psa. 35:16.-“With hypocritical mockers in feasts,” i.e., repeating the
latter words of the former sentence.
“With hypocrites [at feasts], mocking at the feast,” i.e., like
parasites who, for the sake of their belly, flatter others.
Pro. 13:1.-“A wise son heareth his father’s instruction: but a scorner
heareth not rebuke.” Here the Ellipsis is plain, and is correctly supplied
in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.]
Isa. 19:11.-“How say ye unto [the wise] Pharaoh, | am the son of the
wise?” etc.
Isa. 31:5.-“As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.”
Here the word “birds” is feminine. It refers therefore to female
birds, and to maternal love: “As mother-birds fluttering (see Deu.
32:11), or as fluttering birds [defend their young (from the next clause)]
so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.”

One of the words for defend is ФСеЗ, (pahsék), from CDE3
(pasak), Passover. cbe3 (pasak) means primarily to halt (see Isa.
35:6. Lev. 21:18. 2Sa. 4:4). So 1Ki. 18:21, “How long halt ye
(cpe3in) between two opinions?” Heb., as birds hop backwards and
forwards on two boughs. Hence in Exo. 12:13, it is not “when | see the
blood, | will pass over you;” but, it is cbc3bn ТМЛН, “I will halt or
stop at you, and the plague shall not be upon you,” i.e., Jehovah will
stop or halt at (TIM) the door and not suffer the destroyer to enter. So
the precious blood of Christ stops the hand of justice, and is a perfect
defence to the sinner who is sheltered by it.

Hab. 2:3.-“For the vision [is deferred] for an appointed time,” which
word is clearly implied in the following sentence. See also Mal. 1:10.
Luk. 1:17.-“And [the hearts of the] disobedient to the wisdom of the
just.”

Luk. 22:36.-The Greek reads, “He that hath not, let him sell his
garment and buy a sword.” Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] boldly, correctly,
and idiomatically supplies the Ellipsis in the first member from the
following sentence:-“He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment
and buy one” (see on Luk. 22:37 above).
Joh. 6:32.-“Moses gave you not that bread from heaven,” i.e., “that
[true] bread,” from the succeeding clause: “But my Father giveth you
the true bread from heaven.”

Joh. 6:35.-I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never
hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” The exquisite
English of this can never be improved. As an idiomatic version it is
perfect. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] in attempting a
more literal translation is very lame: “not hunger” and “never thirst.” If
we are to be literal, we must supply the Ellipsis by repeating the word
πώποτε (pépote), at any time, from the end of the verse. Both
Versions practically ignore it by including it in the word “never.”

“He that cometh to me shall in no wise hunger [at any time]; and
he that believeth on me shall in no wise thirst at any time,” ie.,
“never,” as expressed thus in both sentences in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]

It is very instructive to note that the negative here is most
emphatic, a doubled negative, which signifies, by no means, in no
wise, in no case; and it is very solemn to notice that whenever it was
used by man, man was never able to make good his asseveration,
e.g., Peter, in Mat. 16:22, said, “This shall not be unto thee,” but it
was. Again in 26:35 he said, “Yet will | not deny thee,” and in Mar.
14:31, “I will not deny thee in any wise,” but Peter did deny the Lord
Jesus! His enemies, in Joh. 11:56, declared, “He will not come to the
feast,” but He did! Peter, in Joh. 13:8, declared, “Thou shalt never
wash my feet,” but Jesus did! Thomas, in Joh. 20:25, declared, “I will
not believe,” but he did, and that without fulfilling his condition!* [Note:
In all this we have a solemn warning to let our yea be yea, and our
nay nay (Mat. 5:37).] On the other hand, how sure, how true, how
certain are the declarations of the Lord Jesus when made with this
same positiveness. Among others note:-

Mat. 5:18. “One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
law till all be fulfilled.”

Mat. 5:20. “Except your righteousness exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no
case enter into the kingdom of heaven.”

Luk. 22:34. “The cock shall not crow this day.” Joh. 13:38.

Joh. 6:37. “Him that cometh unto me, | will in no wise cast out,”
ié., no never, no never cast out.

Heb. 8:12. “Their sins and their iniquities will | remember no
more,” {6., in no wise will | remember any more.
Heb. 13:5. “I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.”

1Pe. 2:6. “He that believeth on him shall not be confounded.”*
[Note: For other examples see Joh. 4:14; Joh. 8:12; Joh.
10:28. Rom. 4:8. 1Th. 4:15; 1Th. 5:3. Heb. 10:17. 2Pe.
1:10. Rev. 3:12, etc.

All these are the immutable promises and purposes of the
living God, and though we are to “cease from man, whose
breath is in his nostrils,” the word of the Lord endureth for
ever. See further under the figure called Repeated
Negation, below.]

Joh. 9:2.-“And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,
this man [that he is blind], or his parents, that he was born blind?”
(See above, page 101).

Joh. 12:25.-“He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.”

Here two expressions are to be repeated from the latter clause, in
the former:-“He that loveth his life [in this world] shall lose it [unto
eternity.”

Act. 2:3.-“And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of
fire, and it sat upon each of them,” i.e., the Holy Spirit, as is clear from
the next verse.
The verse may be rendered:-“And there appeared unto them,
distributed, tongues like as of fire; and he [the Holy Ghost] sat (or
dwelt) upon each of them.” The tongues were not divided into two
parts, as suggested by the popular term “cloven tongues,” but they
were divided, or distributed, among the Twelve.

Act. 7:59.-“And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying,
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”

The Greek reads, “calling upon and saying.” There is evidently an
Ellipsis after the verb “calling upon,” which the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
supplies with the word “God.” The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] supplies the word “Lord.”

The meaning is clear, that Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost
addressed his prayer to Christ, and his words were “Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit.”. Both words must therefore be repeated
thus:-“calling upon the Lord Jesus and saying [Lord Jesus] receive my
spirit.” By this Ellipsis the emphasis is thrown on the act of invocation
and shows that this act of prayer was addressed to the Lord Jesus,
ie., Lord, who art Jesus: or, Jesus who art the Lord.

Where two substantives are placed together in the same gender,
number and case, the latter is in apposition to, and is explanatory of
the former; or, there is an Ellipsis of the words of explanation, “that is
to say,” or “that is.” Sometimes this is supplied by the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
sometimes it is not. See Deu. 22:8, “a damsel that is a virgin.” Jdg.
11:1, margin, “a woman an harlot.” Gen. 13:8, margin, “men brethren.”
Num. 32:14, “an increase of sinful men,” the Hebrew reads:-“an
increase of men who are sinners.” Mat. 18:23, “a certain King”; Greek,
“a man that is a King,” as in 20:1, where the Ellipsis is supplied, “a
man that is an householder.” Luk. 2:15, margin, 24:19, “a prophet”;
Greek, “a man that is a prophet.” Act. 2:29, “men and brethren”;
Greek, “Men who are brethren,” and verse 22, “men of Israel”; Greek,
“men who are Israelites.” So here, Act. 7:59, “Lord, who art Jesus”-
compare Rev. 22:20.
Rom. 2:12.-“For as many as have sinned without law, shall perish also
without [being judged by] law: and as many as have sinned in the law
(or under law) shall be judged by the law.”
Rom. 2:28-29 is an elliptical passage in the Greek, which the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] covers by a free translation.

Adhering to the order and literal meaning of the words in the
original, we must translate and supply as follows:-
“For not he that [is a Jew] outwardly, is a Jew, neither that which [is
circumcision] outwardly in the flesh, is circumcision; but he that [/s a
Jew] inwardly, is a dew, and circumcision of heart in the spirit and not
in the letter [is circumcision].”

Rom. 4:13.-This verse is translated very freely in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
Following the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , we may
supply the Ellipsis from the end of the verse, which it has missed:-“For
not through [righteousness of] law was the promise [made] to
Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, but
through righteousness of faith.”
Rom. 5:16.-“Also not as [the judgment or sentence came] through one
that sinned [/s] the free gift: for the judgment (κρῖμα) [was] after one
[transgression] unto condemnation (κατάκριµα); but the free gift is
after many offences unto δικαίωµα ({8., a righteous acquittal).” (See
below, page 111).
N.B.-It is not δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunee) which is the attribute of
righteousness; nor is it δικαίωσις (dikaidsis) which is the act of the
Judge in justifying; but it is δικαίωµα (dikaiéma) which is the outcome
of the act, the just thing done.
1Co. 1:26-27.-“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many
wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
wise,” etc.

Here the words “are called” are repeated from the preceding
clause, but “are chosen,” i.e., to confound, etc., might be supplied
from the succeeding clause. (See above page 58).
1Co. 5:4-5.-we must supply in verse 4 the verb “to deliver” from verse
5-

πο deliver] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye, and my
spirit, being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ), to deliver [/ say] such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.”
1Co. 6:12.-“All [meats (from verse 13)] are lawful unto me [fo еай, but
all are not profitable; (see 10:33) all [meats] are lawful for me [fo еай,
but | will not be brought under the power of any [теай. Compare
10:23.
1Со. 14:22.-“But prophesying [is for a sign (from previous sentence)]
not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.”
1Со. 15:47.-“The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man, the
Lord from heaven, [is heavenly (from verse 48).” See above on Act.
7:59, as to these two nouns, “the second man [who is] the Lord.”
2Co. 5:10.-“That every one may receive the things done in his body,
according to that he hath done, whether good or bad.”

Here the verb “done” is correctly supplied from the succeeding
clause.
Eph. 2:1.-There is evidently an Ellipsis in this verse; which has been
variously supplied by translators; the usual mode being to Supply the
words from a succeeding clause (verse 5) as in the A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] So in
the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ‚ “did he quicken.” But it 15
worth consideration whether it may not be supplied from 1:19, 20, “the
exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward, who believe, according
to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when
he raised him from the dead ... and you [when you were raised in
Him, and quickened with Him] were dead in trespasses and sins,” etc.
It may also be supplied by repeating the verb from 1:23, “Which is
his body, the fulness of him which filleth all [his saints] with all [spiritual
gifts]. And you [hath he thus filled] who were dead in trespasses and
sins “(chap. 2:1): καὶ ὑμᾶς ὄντας, “and you when ye were,” must be
compared with verse 5, καὶ ὄντας ἡμᾶς, “and we when we were.” This
points to the use of the verb “quickened” in each case.

Php. 3:13.-“Brethren, | count not myself to have apprehended [the
prize (from verse Ί4)]: but this one thing / do, forgetting those things
which are behind [me], and reaching forth unto those things which are
before [me], etc.”

2Ti. 1:5.-“When | call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in
thee.”

There is no verb in the Greek, and the words that is should have
been placed in italics. The Greek reads, “Taking remembrance of the
unfeigned faith [dwelling in thee (from the succeeding clause)], which
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and | am
persuaded that [it dwelleth] in thee also.” Here it is repeated from the
preceding clause.
Tit. 2:2.-“That the aged men be sober, grave, etc.” Supply the verb
“exhort’ from verse 6 here, and also in verses 4 and 9:-“[Exhort] that
the aged men be sober, etc.”
Heb. 8:1.-“We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand
of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,” {6., “such a high priest
[as became us]” (from 7:26).
Il. Complex: Where both Clauses are Involved

An abbreviated form of expression, in which an Ellipsis in the first of
two members has to be supplied from the second, and at the same
time an Ellipsis in the second member has to be supplied from the
first.

Simple Ellipsis puts one member, and leaves the other to be
inferred.

Complex Ellipsis puts two members, and implies two others, and
these two are interchanged. Hence this figure has been called
“Semiduplex Oratio,” i.e., semi-double discourse.
1. Where single words are involved
Pro. 10:1.-“A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son {5 the
heaviness of his mother.”

Here the word “father” in the former clause is to be understood in
the latter; and the word “mother” in the latter clause is to be
understood in the former. For a wise son is a joy to a mother as well
as to a father, and a foolish son is a heaviness to a father as well as to
a mother.

See also chaps. 15:20; 17:25; 23:24; 30:17.

Mat. 23:29.-“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the
sepulchres of the righteous.”

Here the word “build” refers also to the “sepulchres” of the latter
clause; and the word “garnish” refers also to the word “tombs” of the
former clause.

Le., ye not only build the tombs of the prophets, but ye garnish
them: ye not only garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, but ye build
them.
Rom. 5:16.-“And not as it was by one that sinned so {5 the gift: for the
judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
offences unto justification.”

There is evidently an Ellipsis here, as is shown by the italics
employed in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] and the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] But the question is, Is the omission correctly supplied? We
submit the following, treating the first clause as a complex Ellipsis:-

“And not, as [the judgment came] by one that sinned, [does] the
free gift [come by one who was righteous]: for the judgment [was
death] after one [offence] to condemnation, but the free gift [is pardon]
after many offences, unto justification;” i.e., Adam brought the
judgment of death by one sin, Christ by bearing that judgment,
brought life and pardon for many sins. (See above, page 108).

Rom. 10:10.-“With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and
with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”

Here “righteousness” is to be understood in the latter clause, as
well as “salvation”; and “salvation” is to be understood in the former
clause, as well as “righteousness.” Moreover “confession” must be
made with the heart as well as with the mouth; and righteousness
includes salvation. The full completion of the sense is:-“With the heart
man believeth unto righteousness [and salvation] and with [the heart
and] the mouth confession is made unto [righteousness and]
salvation.”

2. Where Sentences are involved
Psa. 1:6.-“For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way
of the ungodly shall perish.”
In the former sentence we have the cause, in the latter the effect.
But both effect and cause are latent in each statement: “The Lord
knoweth the way of the righteous [and it shall not perish], but [the Lord
knoweth] the way of the ungodly [and if] shall perish.”

Psa. 42:8.-“The Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime
and in the night his song shall be with me.”

Here the Ellipsis is insufficiently supplied by the words, “shall be.”
The Ellipsis is complex, and to be understood thus:-The Lord will
command his loving kindness [and his song with me] in the daytime,
and in the night also [he will command his loving kindness and] his
song.

Isa. 32:3.-“And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, [and they
shall see]: and the ears of them that hear shall [not be dull, buf]
hearken.”

Joh. 5:21.-“For like as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.”

Here the Ellipsis is treated as being Simple, instead of Complex,
and is supplied by the word “them.” But the words “raiseth up the
dead” in the former clause are latent in the latter, while the words
“whom he will” in the latter clause are latent in the former, thus:-
“For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [whom he
will]; even so the Son [raiseth up the dead, and] quickeneth whom he
will].”

Or according to the Greek, “So THE SON also.”

Joh. 8:28.-“I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, |
speak these things;” i.e., “Of myself | do nothing [nor speak]; but |
speak these things as the Father hath taught me, [and / do them].”

See a similar illustration in verse 38.

Joh. 14:10.-“The words that | speak unto you | speak not of myself:
but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”

This complex Ellipsis must be understood as follows:-“The words
which | speak unto you, | speak not of myself, [but the Father that
dwelleth in me, he speaketh them]: and [the works which | do, | do not
of myself], but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.”
Joh. 17:26.-“And | have declared unto them thy name, and will
declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them,
and | in them,” i.e., “And | have declared to them thy name, and will
declare [thy love]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be
in them, and | [and my love] may be in them.”
Rom. 6:4.-“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death:
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
Father,” etc.

The complex Ellipsis here may be thus worked out: “Therefore we
are buried with him by His baptism-unto-death [and raised again from
the dead], that like as Christ was [buried and] raised again from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life.” (See pages 18, 19, on the context of this passage).
Heb. 12:20.-“And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be
stoned, or thrust through with a dart.” In Exo. 19:13, the text is, “There
shall not a hand touch it, for he shall surely be stoned or shot through
with a dart; whether it be man or beast, he shall not live.”

Here the man was to be stoned and the beast shot. In the MSS.
words have been gratuitously inserted by transcribers to make sense,
in ignorance of the complex Ellipsis. The sense is made clear thus:-

“And if so much as [a man or] a beast touch the mountain-[if a man
touch] it, he shall be stoned [and if a beast touch it, it shall be] thrust
through with a dart.”
False Ellipsis
There are not only many instances where the Ellipses which exist in
the original have been incorrectly supplied in the translation: but there
are cases also of italics being inserted, where there is really no Ellipsis
in the original.

In these cases the italics have been necessitated by the faulty
translation, and not by the Text.

We give a few examples, arising from various causes:

Gen. 37:12-13.-“And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in
Shechem. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
flock in Shechem?”

The Massorah gives the words rendered “their father’s flock” as
one of the fifteen dotted words,* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction,
pp. 320, 325. Also The Massorah, by the same author and publisher.]
i.e., words which ought to be cancelled in reading, though they have
not been removed from the Text. If these words are removed, then the
inference is that they had gone to feed themselves and make merry,
and the words “the flock’ in verse 13 need not be inserted in italics.
Num. 16:1.-The last word “men” is necessitated by having put the
verb “took” out of its place. There is no Ellipsis. The verse reads that
“Korah ... and Dathan and Abiram ... and On took the sons of
Reuben.” Or that Korah ... took Dathan ... and Abiram ... and On, the
son of Peleth, the sont [Note: According to the Samaritan Pentateuch
and the Septuagint Version and a few MSS.] of Reuben.

Deu. 29:29.-“The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but
those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for
ever, that we may do all the words of this law.”

The italics thus supplied make excellent sense in English, but this
is not the sense of the Hebrew.

The Massorah gives the words, “to the Lord our God,” as being
one of fifteen examples in which the words are dotted and which are
therefore to be cancelled in reading.t [Note: See Ginsburg’s
Introduction, pp. 370, 572.] If these words be removed the sense will
be, “The secret things and the revealed things are for us and for our
children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law,” i.e., the
secret things which have not been, but will yet be revealed. Compare
chap. 30:11-14.

Deu. 32:34-35.-Here, in verse 35, the word “belongeth” is inserted in
italic type through reading the Hebrew Miu (lee) as being the
preposition and pronoun “to me.” But the Й (yod) is really the
abbreviation of the word Йен (убт) day, * [Note: See Ginsburg’s
Introduction, Part ., chap. м., pp. 165-170.] as is clear from the
Targum of Onkelos, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Septuagint
translation Taking, then, Min (lee) as being an abbreviation of ΜΜΘΗ
(Гуот) for the day, the four lines form an alternate correspondence:
the first line reading on consecutively with the third, and the second
with the fourth, thus:-

а — 15 not this laid up in store with me,

Ь Sealed up in my treasuries
а — For the day of vengeance and recompense,
Ь — For the time when their foot shall slip?

Here, b is in a parenthesis with respect to a and a, while a is ina
parenthesis with respect to b and b; and the passage really reads thus
as regards the actual sense; “Is not this laid up in store with me for the
day of vengeance and recompense:

“Sealed up in my treasuries for the time when their foot shall
slide?”

The word ΜΜΘΗ (Губт), for the day, corresponds with МТЪ
(Vath), for the time.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders the last two
lines, “Vengeance is mine and recompense, at the time when their foot
shall slide.”
Jos. 24:17.-“For the Lord our God, He it is that brought us up and our
fathers out of the land of Egypt.” Here the two words “it is” are
supplied in italics, because it is not observed that there is an
Homeeoteleuton§ [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, Part ΙΙ. chap. vi.
pp. 171-182.] (αν. [Note: Which see.] ) in the Hebrew Text; i.e., the
Scribe having written the word “He” omitted the next word “is God,” his
eye going back to a second “He” which follows it. This is clear from the
fact that the words “is God” are preserved in the Septuagint
translation.

The passage therefore reads, “For the Lord our God, He is God,
He brought us up, etc.,” thus emphasizing the pronoun “He” by
Repetition (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).
1Sa. 24:9-10.-“David said to Saul ... some bade me kill thee, but mine
eye spared thee.” The Hebrew Text as it now stands is CbbC
(vattachas) but she spared thee. This yields no sense, so the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] have followed the
Vulgate and inserted “mine eye” in italics. But Dr. Ginsburg points out*
[Note: Introduction, pp. 291, 292.] that in all probability in the
transcription of the Text from the ancient Phoenician characters into
the square characters, (which is A) was mistaken for (which is b)
and so b3C, she spared, was written instead of A3C, / spared. There
can be no question that this was the primitive reading as it is
preserved in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]
Chaldee, and Syriac.

2Sa. 1:18.-“He bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
bow: behold, it is written in the book of dasher.”

Here the words supplied are manifestly incorrect. It should be, “He
commanded them to teach the children of Judah ‘The Bow,’ or [this
Song ой ‘The Bow,’ behold, it is written in the book of Jashar,” i.e., the
upright, a book of national songs, probably, but of which nothing is
known. It is clear that this song of David's had not already been
written in that book, but he gave directions that it should be there
written. See also Jos. 10:13.
2Sa. 1:21.-“For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the
shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.”

The italics are wrongly supplied through not knowing that Omi
(b'lee) not should be Omi Т [Note: This is the reading of the first
Edition of the Hebrew Bible, Soncino, 1488; also of the Syriac and
Arabic Versions, and the Chaldee paraphrase. The mistake of a for &
could be easily made.
See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 144.] (k’lee) weapons.

With this emendation the verse reads:-

“For there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away,

The shield of Saul, the weapons anointed with oil,”

or, “The weapons of him anointed with oil.”
1К!. 20:33.-“Now the men did diligently observe whether anything
would come from him, and did hastily catch it.”

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] is a loose paraphrase. The R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] indicates the difficulty. In the Eastern
Recension the words are divided differently from the Textus
Receptus,} [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 438.] and should
be rendered,

“Now the men divined and hasted [i.e., by Hendiadys (q.v. [Note:
Which see] ) quickly divined (his drift)] and they pressed whether it
was from him, and they said, etc.”

Neh. 4:12.-“They said unto us ten times, from all places whence ye
shall return unto us, [they will be upon you],” margin, “that from all
places ye must return to us.”
The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] puts the margin of
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] in the Text, and the Text in the margin.

It appears that it is not a case in which the apodosis is to be
supplied, but it may be taken literally. “They said unto us ten times,
From all places ye shall return unto us.”

Psa. 1:4.-“The ungodly are not so.” Lit., “Not so the ungodly.”

The structure of the Psalm shows that

Verse 1 corresponds with verse 5.
Verse 2 corresponds with verse 4-.
Verse 3 corresponds with verse -4.
Verses 1-3 concerning the godly.
Verses 4 and 5 the ungodly.

Thus:-

present.

А 1-3. The godly
В 4, 5. The ungodly
future.
А 6-. The godly
В -6. The ungodly
The first two may be expanded thus:-
The godly.
A a — 1. Their blessing (not standing with the ungodly now)
Their way.
Ь — 2. Their character
ο 3. Comparison
The ungodly.
Their way.
B Ь 4-. Their character
ο. -4. Comparison
8 5. Their punishment (not standing with the godly in the
judgment)
Therefore verse 4 corresponds with verse 2; and verse 2 must be
understood, if not supplied, thus:-“Not so the ungodly: their delight is
not in the law of the Lord, neither do they meditate in His law, etc.”
For the Ellipsis in verse 5 see page 82.

Psa. 2:12.-“And ye perish from the way.” R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] “and ye perish in the way.”

There is no “in” or “from” in the Hebrew: it is literally, “and ye lose
the way.” To lose the way is a Hebrew idiom for perishing, or being
lost. It ought either to be translated literally, “and ye lose the way,” or
idiomatically, “and ye be lost,” or, “and ye perish.” Psa. 1:1-6 ends with
the perishing of “the way,” and Psa. 2:1-12 ends with the perishing of
those who refuse to walk in it, by submitting themselves to the Son.
“Kiss,” Psa. 2:12, is the same as “be ruled by” in Gen. 41:40, margin.
Psa. 10:3.-“For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
the covetous whom the Lord abhorreth.” Margin, “and the covetous
blesseth himself, he abhorreth the Lord.”

The struggles of the Revisers to make sense of the present
Hebrew Text may be seen in their rendering:

“For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and the covetous
renounceth, yea, contemneth the Lord.” Margin, “and blesseth the
covetous, but revileth the Lord.”

The simple fact is that this is one of the passages altered by the
Sopherim through a mistaken reverence, in order to avoid the uttering
of the words involving a curse on Jehovah. But in this case, having
altered “he blasphemeth” into “he blesseth,” the word “blesseth” they
did not remove it from the text. Hence both words now stand in the
printed text, which is as follows:

“For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire; and the robber
blesseth, blasphemeth the Lord.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction,
р. 365.]

If we simply remove the word “blesseth,” we have the primitive text
without more ado, and have no need to supply any Ellipsis.

Psa. 19:3.-“There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
heard.”

Here the word “where” seems to be unnecessarily supplied. The
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] omits it. The sense appears
to be, as expressed in the margin, “without these their voice is heard.”
That is to say, with regard to the heavens “[they have] no speech nor
language; their voice is not heard,” and yet they do utter speech, they
do declare knowledge; and their words go forth through all the earth.t
[Note: See The Witness of the Stars (by the same author and
publisher), pp. 4-6.]
Psa. 27:13.-“/ had fainted unless | had believed to see the goodness
of the Lord in the land of the living.”

The words, “/ had fainted,” both in the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] , are an arbitrary addition in order to
make sense.

The difficulty arises from disregarding the fact that the word
“unless” is dotted in the printed text, and should be cancelled in
reading. It is cancelled in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).] Syriac and Vulgate, and the clause should be rendered:

“| believe that | shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
the living.”* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 333.]

Psa. 68:16.-“Why leap ye, ye high hills? This is the hill which God
desireth to dwell in.”

Here, by taking ШЦГ (ratzad) as meaning to leap, the sense has
been obscured, and then the attempt is made to clear it by the use of
the italics.

ШЦГ occurs only here, and is an Arabic word, which means to
look askance at, or to envy, and the verse reads naturally: “Why do ye
envy, О ye high hills, the hill God desired for His seat?” i.e., Sinai, see
verse 17. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] agrees with
this.

Psa. 69:4.-“They that would destroy me, being mine enemies
wrongfully.”

The Syriac supplies a letter (T), thus giving the reading, “more
than my bones,” instead of “they that would destroy me being,” etc. So
that the verse reads:

“They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my
head;

“They that are mine enemies falsely are more than my bones.”
Psa. 69:20 (21).-Ί looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
and for comforters, but | found none.”

Translated more closely with the Chaldee, Septuagint, Syriac, and
Vulgate, we may dispense with the italics:-

“| looked for a sympathizer, but there was none. And for
comforters, but | found none.”
Psa. 75:5 (6).-“Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff
neck.”

Here, owing to the fact that quiescent letters are sometimes
inserted and sometimes omitted in the Heb. text, the A (aleph) is
inserted in the word Ouew (b'tzur) rock, making it 6ueaw
(b’tzavwvahr) neck. The LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.).] evidently read it as rock, without the aleph, and the passage
ought to read without the italics:-

“Do not exalt your horn toward heaven, nor speak arrogantly of the

Rock.”
Psa. 118:5.-“I called upon JAH in distress: Jehovah answered me,
and set me in a large place.” According to the Western Recension of
the Heb. text (which the Textus Receptus follows) Goms6ng
(Bammerchavyah) is one word, and means in a large place, and
hence, with freedom or with deliverance (compare Hos. 4:16, Psa.
31:8). But according to the Eastern Recension the reading is
presented in two words 601136 WG; * [Note: See Ginsburg’s
Introduction, pp. 385, 386.] and the verse should be rendered:
“I called upon JAH in my distress. He answered me with the
deliverance of JAH.”

It will be noted that both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] ignore the Textus Receptus, and not only divide the
word into two, but remove it from the end to the beginning of the line.
Consequently they have to supply the sense with the italics, “and set
me.”

Psa. 126:3.-“Whereof we are glad.” Here the word “whereof’ is
unnecessary.

The structure gives:-

а 2-. Our gladness.

Ь -2. The Lord’s great things.
Ь — 3-. The Lord’s great things.
а -3. Our gladness.
Or fully thus:-
а _2-. Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue
with singing.
b -2. Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath
done great things for them.
Ь — 3-. The Lord hath done great things for us:

а — -3. Weare glad.

It will be seen how а answers to a, and b 10 b.

Psa. 127:2.-‘It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
bread of sorrows; for so he giveth his beloved sleep.”

Here the word “for’ is unnecessarily introduced, creating a
confusion of thought and hiding the meaning. Translated correctly, the
sense is perfect without any human addition. The word “so,” is On
thus, in this manner. № refers to what follows, viz., to the Lord’s way of
giving in contrast to man’s way of “works.” God's spiritual blessings
are not obtained by incessant labour-rising early and sitting up late,
nor by painful and sorrowful effort. “Thus He giveth”-this is the way He
giveth to His beloved-How? “sleeping” or while they sleep. uypa
(sheynah) is an adverbial accusative, meaning “in sleep.”
It was in this way He gave His wondrous gifts to Solomon. His
name was (ὔγήτήῃ) “Yedidiah,” i.e., beloved of Jehovah (238.
12:25). The word here is also ЙГИГ Yedeed, i.e., beloved. And this
Psalm relates to Solomon, as we learn from the Title. Solomon knew
by a blessed experience how God gave to him His richest blessings
while he was “sleeping” (1Ki. 3:3-15). Even so He gave to Adam a
Bride (Gen. 2:21-22); to Abram, the everlasting Covenant (Gen.
15:12-16), and to Jedidiah “His beloved,” wisdom, riches and honour.
“Thus He giveth to His beloved while they sleep” when they are
helpless and are unable to put forth any effort of works, by which to
earn the blessing, and in which the flesh might glory before God.
(1Со. 1:29.)

How wondrously He gives! E’en while we sleep-

When we from all our “works” have ceased, and rest;

And He our life doth mercifully keep,

Then, without works, are His beloved blest.* [Note: Rom. 11:6.]

Yes! “His beloved”! lovéd not because
Of any work which we have ever done;t [Note: Tit. 3:5.]

But loved in perfect grace, “without a cause”:¢ [Note: Rom. 3:24.
“Being justified freely by His grace.” The word “freely” here is
the same word (222223) dérean as in Joh. 15:25, where it is
rendered “without a cause.” (“They hated me without a
cause”). There was absolutely no cause why our blessed Lord
Jesus was “hated.” Even so it is with regard to our
justification:-“Being justified without a cause by His grace.”]
This is the source whence all our blessings come.

He gives in sleep! In vain we toil and strive-

And rise up early and so late take rest:
But, while our powers in sweetest sleep revive,
And we abandon all our anxious quest-

Then He bestows His gifts of grace on us,

And where we've never sown, He makes us reap

A harvest, full of richest blessing. “Thus
He gives to His belovéd while they sleep.”
Song Son. 8:6.-“For love is strong as death: jealousy is cruel as the
grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement
flame.” This last sentence is the rendering of one word in the Textus
Receptus μιμμσρήῃ (Shalhebethyah), but, according to the
Eastern Recension, and several early editions, it is divided into two
words, “the flames of Jah.” Hence the sense is:
“Love is strong as death.
Affection is inexorable as Hades.
Its flames are flames of fire.
The flames of Jah.”§ [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p.
386]
The second and fourth lines are the intensification of the first and
third.
The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] renders the last line,

“A very flame of the Lord.”
Eze. 22:20.-“As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and
tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it: so
will | gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and | will leave you
there and melt you.”

It will be noticed that this last sentence is a non sequitur, both as
to rhythm and parallelism. The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] is no clearer: “And | will lay you there.”

The fact is that the letter Ф (Pe) т едфзЗЪЙ (v’hippachtee), in
the ancient and primitive text was mistaken for ) (nun), (owing to the
similarity of the Phoenician characters, when transcribed into the more
modern square characters); and thus / will blow became / will leave,
and then the two words, “you there,” had to be supplied in order to
make sense.* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 294.] The
parallelism is thus beautifully perfect:

а — As they gather ...

Ь toblow...
cto melt it:
а Sowwilll gather ...
Ь — апа | will blow
с — апа melt you.

It will be seen how the words, “I will leave,” mar this structure.

Hos. 4:7.-“As they were increased, so they sinned against me:
therefore will | change their glory into shame.”

The word “therefore” is inserted by the translators; who did not
know that this is one of the eighteen emendations of the Sopherimt
[Note: See Appendix E: and Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 357.] by
which the primitive text, “my glory,” by the change of one letter (ἄ for
H) became “their glory,” and the first person became the third. The
original text stood:-

“As they increased, so they sinned against me:
They have changed my glory into shame;
They eat up,” etc.

A like alteration was made in Jer. 2:11, and very anciently; for it is
followed by the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ,
the ancient versions, and A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] It should be “my glory,” not “their glory.”

Jon. 3:9.-“Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
his fierce anger, that we perish not?”

Here it is not necessary to put the word “if’ in italics. The Hebrew
idiom, in the formula or expression OM OWETT (mee yodeah) means
who knoweth? in the sense of no one knows whether, or no one
knows but that (see Psa. 90:11. Ecc. 2:19; Ecc. 3:21; Ecc. 6:12; Ecc.
8:1. Joe. 2:14). The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
translates Jon. 3:9 as the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders Ecc. 2:19, “who
knoweth whether” (without italics).

Ralph Venning* [Note: Orthodox Paradoxes, 1650-1660 a.d.]

beautifully expresses the theology of this and similar passagest
[Note: Such as 2Ch. 34:19-21. Isa. 39:5; Isa. 39:8.] in the following
lines:-

“But stay! Is God like one of us? Can He,

When He hath said it, alter His decree?

Denouncéd judgment God doth oft prevent,
But neither changeth counsel nor intent;

The voice of heaven doth seldom threat perdition,

But with express or an implied condition:

So that, if Nineveh return from ill,

God turns His hand: He doth not turn His will.”
Mal. 3:9.-“Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even
this whole nation.” This must be added to the eighteen emendations of
the Sopherim.¢ [Note: See Appendix E: and Ginsburg’s Introduction,
p. 3631]

The primitive text was, “Ye have cursed me with a curse.” The
active was changed into the passive by putting [ for О.
Mat. 20:23.-“To sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to
give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
Father.”

This supply of the Ellipsis has caused much confusion. The R.V.
[Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] also unnecessarily inserts “but it
is for them for whom it is prepared of my Father.”

The passage reads:-“To sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not
mine to give but [it is already given] to them for whom it is prepared of
my Father.”

Mar. 11:13.-“And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if
haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he
found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.”

Here, want of accuracy in the translation has created a difficulty,
and the word “yet’ has been added, in order to meet it. Want of
attention to the full meaning of the Greek has led to alterations of the
Text itself by various copyists: for man is always ready to assume
anything to be at fault, except his own understanding.

The last clause, by the figure of Hyperbaton (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ), is put out of its grammatical order; for the purpose of calling
attention to it, and to complete the structure (see below). Naturally, it
would follow the word “thereon.” The word “for” introduces the
explanation of “if haply.” It does not give the reason why He found
nothing, but the reason why it was doubtful.

The R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] translates literally,
“for it was not-the season of figs:” but still leaves the difficulty of Jesus
going to find figs when it was not the fig-season.

There are two or three points to be noted:

The word καιρός (kairos) means not “time,” which is χρόνος
(chronos), but a limited portion of time, and always with the idea of
Suitability; hence, the right time, proper season, stated season, when
the thing referred to comes to a head, or crisis. Hence, applied to a
tree, it denotes the ordinary and regular fruit-season of that
tree.* [Note: It is interesting to note that in modern Greek, the word
22222? (kairos), season, has come to mean “weather”; while 222222
(chronos) time, is now used not merely of time, but “year.”] The
Passover did not occur at the proper fig-season; but figs remained on
the trees (dried) right through the winter. These, which could generally
be found, were called cbB (pag). The name is preserved in the word
Bethphage (βηθφαγή, for 6”bOchaBi, house of figs). At the time
of the Passover, such figs might well have been looked for.
The Lord went to see “if consequently (ei Gea) he might find
anything thereon.” It was “if consequently,” because “it was not the
proper season of figs” (oUka, suka: not ὄλυνθοι, olunthoi, as the others
were called, and for which He sought).

We must also remember that in the East all fruit trees were
enclosed in gardens, and had an owner. This tree, though, by the
roadside (Mat. 21:19) must have been enclosed, and as it grew over
the wall, passers by might partake of the fruit. But the owner had
probably shaken the fruit off, or gathered it himself, and hence
deserved the judgment which came upon him (see Lev. 19:9-10; Lev.
23:22. Deu. 24:19-21). This is one of the two miracles of destruction
wrought by Jesus: and we know that in the other case the owners of
the swine were justly punished.
The miracle has its prophetic teaching for us. In the preceding
verse we read how Jesus went into the temple, and “looked round
about upon all things,” and went out to Bethany. In the morning He
destroyed this tree on His way to the cleansing of the Temple; after
which (verse 17) He taught them, saying, “Is it not written, My house
shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made
it a den of robbers” (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ). The
fruit of such a tree was for all who passed by (Deu. 23:24): but it did
not answer its end, and it was destroyed. In like manner that House,
which through the greed of man had failed to fulfil its purpose, Would
be destroyed as that fig-tree had been.

The verse then reads thus: “And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having
leaves, he went if consequently anything [/.e., any ὄλυνθοι (olunthoi),
dried figs] he should find on it: for it was not the time of figs (σῦκα,
suka): and oncoming up to it, nothing found he save leaves.” The
explanatory clause (though it belongs to the former clause, as here
rendered) is put last to complete the structure which is as follows:-

Structure of the passage (Mar. 11:13).

Α And seeing a fig-tree afar off

В shaving leaves,
С а hecame,
Ь _ if haply he might find anything thereon:
С а andwhen he came to it,

The subjects correspond thus:-

B Leaves.

Joh. 8:6.-Неге the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] has given an addition which pertains
rather to the expositor than to the Translator:
“But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground
as though he heard them not.”
It is impossible to know all the motives of the Lord Jesus in this
act; but, judging from Eastern habits of to-day, there was a silent
contempt and an impressive rebuke implied in this inattention to their
insincere charge.

Rom. 1:7 and 1Co. 1:2 -“Called to be saints,”.
Rom. 1:1, and 1Co. 1:1.-“Called {ο be an apostle.”

It is a question whether there is any ellipsis here, or whether it is
correctly supplied. The Greek is κλητοῖς ἁγίοις (kleetois hagiois). But
we have these same words in the Septuagint translation of Lev. 23:2,
which throws light upon the expression. “Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which ye
shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.” The
ΙΧΧ. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] translates the
words “holy convocations,” κλητὰς ἁγίας (kleetas hagias), i.e.,
assemblies by special calling as holy to the Lord. Hence, in the New
Testament expressions the meaning is the same, i.e., saints by the
calling of God, or by Divine calling: viz., those who have been Divinely
selected and appointed as saints. So also of an apostle it denotes one
who has by a special calling of God been made an apostle. In other
words, “by Divine calling, saints;” or “by Divine calling, an apostle.”
Rom. 12:3.-“For | say, through the grace given unto me, to every man
that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think.”
It is a question here, whether the thinking ought to be limited by
the insertion of the words “of himself,” as there is no limitation in the
Greek. The verb ὑπερφρονέω (hyperphroneé) occurs only in this
passage, and it means {ο think more than one ought, not merely of
one’s self, but of anything. It denotes especially a highmindedness
about any subject, which makes one proud, arrogant, boastful or
insolent. Indeed, there is in this verse another figure, or peculiar form
of words, called Paregmenon (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] ), where several
words of a common origin are used in the same sentence. This figure
is used for the purpose of calling our attention to the statement so as
to emphasize it. The words can be only inadequately expressed in
translation: “For | say, through the grace given unto me, to every man
that is among you, not to THINK-more-highly (ὑπερφονεῖν
hyperphronein) than he ought to THINK (φρονεῖν phronein), but to
THINK (φρονεῖν, phronein) so as to THINK-soberly (σωφρονεῖν
sdéphronein), according as to each one [of you] God hath distributed
[his] measure of faith.”

The verses which follow show that God has dealt out spiritual gifts
in different measures (verse 6), and that he who has a larger measure
than another is not on that account to be proud, or to think on any
subject beyond his own measure of faith.
2Co. 6:1.-“We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also,
&с.”

The insertion of the words, “with him,” here, and in the R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] also, gives a totally false view of our
position as workers. The sense is quite complete without any addition
whatever. We are not fellow-workers with God, but with our brethren;
with you, not with him, should be the words supplied, if any. The verse
reads: “But working together (or as fellow-workers with you), we
exhort also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”

Gal. 3:24.-“The law was our schoolmaster {ο bring us unto Christ.”

Here there is no need to introduce the words, “to bring us,” the
sense being complete without them: εἰς (e/s), unto, is used in its well-
known sense of up fo, or until. See Php. 1:10, “That ye may be sincere
and without offence till the day of Christ.” Eph. 1:14, “Which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession.”

That is to say, until Christ came and brought justification by free,
pure, and true grace, the Law, like a tutor, kept them under restraint;
and is here in entire contrast to that liberty wherewith Christ hath
made His people free (see chap. 5:1, and Joh. 8:36. Rom. 8:2).

Gal. 3:20.-“Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.”
Here the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
both repeat the noun mediator, which only introduces confusion. The
sense is clear without it.

“Now a mediator is not of one [party]:” i.e., there must be two
parties where there is a mediator; for he is a person who stands
between the two others. Now when God gave the promise to Abram
(Gen. 15:9-21), there was only one party; for God caused Abram to
fall into a deep sleep, and He Himself “was one”-the One who, alone,
was thus the one party to this glorious covenant; which is therefore
unconditional, and must stand for ever.

Heb. 2:16.-“For verily he took not on him the nature of angels.”

The Greek is, “For verily he taketh not hold of angels, but of the
seed of Abraham he taketh hold,” i.e., to redeem them, hence he had
to partake of the nature of Abraham’s seed; but this is in verse 17, not
16.
Heb. 4:15.-“But was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin,” i.e., “but was tried according to all things, according to our
likeness, apart from sin.”

Heb. 12:2.-“Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.”
There is no Ellipsis here, but both the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note:
The Revised Version, 1881.] have supplied the word “our,” which
introduces quite a different thought into the passage.

It is evident that it is not our faith, but faith itself.

In the preceding chapter we have many examples of faith. Each
one exhibits some particular aspect of faith in its perfection. For
example; in Abel, we have the most perfect example of faith in
connection with worship: in Enoch the most perfect example of faith’s
walk: while in Noah, we have the most perfect example of faith’s
witness, and so on through the chapter; the historical order
corresponding with the theological and experimental order. Each is
like a portrait in which some particular feature is perfect: while the
chapter concludes with two groups of portraits; the one illustrating
faith’s power to conquer (verses 32-35), and the other illustrating
faith’s power to suffer (verses 36-38). Then chap. xii. continues,
“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses* [Note: |.e., those who gave testimony or evidence
by their words, their life or death. There is no idea of eye-witnesses in
this word, as though they were beholding or looking upon us. The
witnesses referred to are the examples of faith cited in chap. 11.] let
us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,
and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking ({6.,
ἀφορῶντες, aphoréntes, looking away from) unto.”

Unlike these examples, which each had only one aspect of faith in
perfection, Jesus had every aspect perfect. His was a portrait in which
every feature was perfect, for He is the Beginner and Ender of faith.
He leads the van and brings up the rear; He is the Sum and the
Substance of faith. It is not “οι” faith of which Jesus is here the
Author and Finisher, but faith itself. The Greek goes on to say, “looking
off unto the author and finisher of faith-Jesus.”

Looking off from all these human examples, each of which after all
exhibited only one feature of faith, unto Him who is the perfect Princet
[Note: The word translated “author” is a?????? (archeegos) really an
adjective, leading, furnishing the first cause; then it means a leader,
but it is more a chief leader; hence it is sometimes rendered Prince.
Originator, beginner, and author are all parts of its meaning. It occurs
only in Act. 3:15, “killed the Prince of life,” i.e., the author and giver of
life; Act. 5:31, “exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour’; Heb. 2:10, “to
make the Captain of their salvation perfect,” i.e. the author of their
salvation. Hence, princely-leader is a meaning which embraces all the
others.] and Leader of all faithful ones and the Author of faith itself-
even Jesus, “who for the joy that was set before him endured the
cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
throne of God.”

1Jn. 3:16.-“Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid
down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren.”
This passage read without the italics is perfectly clear and
beautiful:-“Hereby perceive we love,” i.e., what love really is! or
“Hereby have we got to know love” (perfect tense). For it was never
known what love was, until HE-Jesus-laid down His life for us. The
only Ellipsis here is in the definition of the subject “he.” It is ἐκεῖνος
(ekeinos), that one, that blessed One, the Lord Jesus. All the more
emphatic from its being presupposed that He is so wonderful that
there can be no possible doubt as to His identity. Just as in 2Ti. 1:12 :
“For | know whom (he does not say, in whom) | have believed, and |
am persuaded that he is able to keep that (he does not say what)
which He has committed unto me against that day” (R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] margin), (he does not say what day)! That
which God had committed unto Paul was “that goodly deposit”-the
revelation of the mystery concerning the Body of Christ. The word
παραθήκη (paratheeke) occurs only here (verse 14) and 1Ti. 6:20
(according to the best texts). It was committed to Timothy also, and he
was to guard it by the Holy Spirit dwelling within him. And though all
might turn away from him and his teaching concerning it (verse 15),
yet God would guard it and care for it, and preserve it against that day.
2Pe. 1:20-21.-“Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is
of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time
(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , at any time) by the will of man: but holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

Here, there is no Ellipsis. The words “as they were moved” merely
represent the participle “being moved,” as in the R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.]

The confessed difficulty of this passage arises partly from the
peculiar words employed. (1) The noun translated “interpretation”
(ἐπήλυσις, epilusis) occurs nowhere else in the whole Bible, and only
once or twice in secular Greek writings. Even the verb (ἐπιλύω, epilud)
occurs only twice, viz., Mar. 4:34, “He expounded all things to his
disciples,” and Act. 19:39, “It shall be determined in a lawful
assembly,” {Θ., made known in such an assembly. The verb means to
untie, unloose, and hence to unfold or disclose. This is its meaning in
the only place where it occurs in the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint
Version (325 b.c.).] , Gen. 41:12, of Joseph interpreting the dreams of
Pharaoh's servants. Here it is used as the translation of the Heb.
Φμμι (pathar), to open, unfold, or disclose. Hence, the noun can
mean only an unfolding, or disclosure: just as when one Unties a
parcel or bundle, and discloses what is contained within it.

(2) The word “private” is the translation of the word ἴδιος (idios),
which occurs 113 times. It is never translated “private,” except here.
Seventy-seven times it is rendered “his own” (e.g., “his own servants,”
Mat. 25:14; “his own country,” Joh. 4:44; “his own name,” Joh. 5:43;
“his own sheep,” Joh. 10:3-4, etc.).

Then the verb “is” is not the equivalent for the verb “to be,” but it is
quite a different ναΓρ-(γίνοµαι, ginomai), which means to begin to be,
come into existence, to originate, arise, become, come to pass, etc.

Now, putting these facts together and observing the order of the
words in the original, we read the passage thus:-

“Knowing this first, that all prophecy of Scripture came (or
originated) not of his or its own [i.e., the prophet’s own] unfolding (or
Sending forth); for not by the will of man was prophecy at any time
brought in, but borne along by the Holy Spirit spake the holy men of
God.”
Or keeping to the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] as far as possible:-“Knowing this first,
that no prophecy of the Scripture came of [the prophet’s, or of its own]
unfolding; for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but the
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

Or taking the last clause as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , “But holy men spake from God, [not from
themselves], moved by the Holy Ghost.”

The whole scope of this passage is, not the interpretation of
Scripture, but its origin: it does not speak of what the Scripture means,
but of whence it comes.

Zeugma: or, Unequal Yoke
Zeug’-ma. Greek ζεῦγμα, a yoke; from ζεύγνυµι (zeugnumi), to join or
yoke together.

This name is given to the figure, because one verb is yoked on to
