Topographia is such a description of a place as exhibits it to our
view; as the description of Sheol, Isa. 14:9-12; Isa. 30:33 :

The new Heaven and Earth, Isa. 65:17, etc.; Rev. 21:1, etc.:

The future glory of Jerusalem and the Land, Isa. 33:20-21; Isa.
35:6-10. Psa. 46:5-6; Psa. 60:6-9.

In Psa. 89:12, the description shows that the points of the
compass are always* [Note: Excepting perhaps parts of Ezekiel
written in Babylon.] reckoned with reference to Jerusalem, “The north
and the south thou hast created them: Tabor (in the west) and Hermon
(in the east) shall rejoice in thy name.”

Thus the description of these places completes the four points of
the compass.

The names of the places in Isa. 10:28-32 give us the course of the
invasion of the land by the King of Assyria.

The “Sea” is frequently mentioned by way of description to show
that the West is intended: the Mediterranean being on the West of the
Land. See Num. 2:18 (Heb.). Jos. 16:5-6. Eze. 42:19 (Heb.).

In Psa. 107:3, however, the Sea evidently denotes the Red Sea;
and though the word “sea” is in the Hebrew, it is rendered “South.”
The emphasis put upon the wonderful Exodus is thus quietly but very
powerfully introduced:” And gathered them out of the lands, from the
east, and from the west, from the north, and from the sea!” because
the deliverance from Egypt was through the sea.

In Psa. 72:8, “from sea to sea” means from the Mediterranean to
the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Compare Exo. 23:31.

Sometimes a description of place is added and thrown in to
convey a lesson, e.g., Joh. 6:10, “Now there was much grass in the
place.” Act. 8:26, “Which is desert,” to show that it mattered not to the
true servant whether he ministered in a city (verse 5), and gave joy to
crowds of people (verse 8), or whether he ministered to one soul in
the desert (verse 26).

See also Isa. 65:17-25. Joe. 2:3. Luk. 16:24-26. Joh. 11:18.

When the description is confined to time, it is called
