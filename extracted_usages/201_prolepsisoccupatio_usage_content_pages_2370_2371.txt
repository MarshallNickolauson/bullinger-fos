We will consider these in order with the different names which

have been given to them.

1. Tecta:
From the Latin tego, to roof or cover. The Prolepsis is so called when
it anticipates the objection, but confines itself merely to stating it. It is
called HYPOPHORA, hy-poph’-o-ra. Greek, ὑποφόρα, a holding
under, putting forward; then, that which is held forth, an objection.

Sometimes the objection is not stated, but is implied by the answer
which is given.

Rom. 9:6.-“Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For
they are not all Israel which are of Israel.”

The objection which is met is this: If Israel be rejected and cast off
for a time (as is going to be shown), then the Word of God has failed,
and is ineffectual. No! For they are not all Israel which are of Israel.
And there is to be a People taken out from among the Gentiles for His
name, as well as a remnant of Israel, according to the election of
grace.

Rom. 10:18.-“But | say, Have they not heard? (Anticipating the
objection that they have not heard.) Yes verily,” etc.

Rom. 11:1.-“l say then, Hath God cast away his people?” (Anticipating
the objection, which many make even until to-day.) To which he
replies, “God forbid,” etc.
