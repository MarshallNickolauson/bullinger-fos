to prepare for a shock it is called Prodiorthosis (q.v. [Note: Which see.]

Php. 4:10.-‘I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now, at the last, your

lacked opportunity.”

When what has been said concludes with an example, it is called

thing as a sample of another in respect to some particular point.

Exemplum, on the other hand, is when we conclude a sentence by
employing an example as a precedent to be followed or avoided:-
Luk. 17:31-32.-“In that day, he which shall be upon the house top, and
his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he
that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot’s
