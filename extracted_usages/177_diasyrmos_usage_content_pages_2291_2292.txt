An Expression of Feeling by way of tearing away Disguise
Di’-a-syrm-os. Greek, διασυρµός, a tearing in pieces, from διασύρειν
(diasurein); and this from διά (dia) and σύρειν (surein), to drag, to
force away.

Twice the word is used in connection with Paul: Act. 8:3, “haltug”;
and Act. 14:19, “drew.”

This figure is so called, because it tears away the veil, or whatever
may be covering the real matter in question, and shows it up as it
really is. Hence, raillery which tears away all disguise.

Mat. 26:50.-“Friend, wherefore art thou come?”

Joh. 7:4.-The Lord’s brethren seek to reflect upon Him, as if He were
mismanaging His affairs. But, in this case, the Diasyrmos proceeded
from their own mistake as to what His mission really was. “There is no
man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be
known openly.”
