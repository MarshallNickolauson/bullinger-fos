name of Eliakim, afterwards called Jehoiakim, which means God will
establish (as does his grandson’s, Jehoiachin-this Jeconiah). But his
hopes were vain. Josiah’s family is remarkable for the manner in
which the names are broken up and their kingdom overtaken by
disaster.

See Jer. 22:24. “As | live, saith the Lord, though Coniah, the son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet
would | pluck thee thence”; and read on to the end of the chapter.

In verse 30, “Write ye this man childless” is explained to mean that
not one of his seven sons (1Ch. 3:17-18) sat upon his throne, but
Zerubbabel, his grandson, became governor after Coniah had died in
Babylon (2Ki. 25:29-30).
