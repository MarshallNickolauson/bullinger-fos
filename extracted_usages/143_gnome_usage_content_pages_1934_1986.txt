4. Where several citations are amalgamated (composite
quotations).
5. Where the quotations are made from books other than the
Bible.
We will now consider these forms of Quotation in order:-
|. As to their Internal form, i.e., the sense as distinct from the
words
In the consideration of Quotations, care must be taken to note what is
said to be “spoken,” and what is said to be “written.” Some prophecies
were written and never spoken; some were spoken by the Prophet
and afterwards written down in his “prophecies”; others were “spoken”
and never written down at all, and when, therefore, a passage is
quoted as having been “spoken,” we may or may not find it written
down in the Old Testament Scriptures. But when it is said to have
been “written,” then we shall find it surely written down in the
Scriptures of truth.

Surely there is all the difference in the world between τὸ ῥηθέν (to
rheethen), that which was spoken, and ὁ γέγραπται (ho gegraptai),
that which standeth written.

There is a further consideration which will help us when the
quotations are prophecies. Prophecy is the utterance of the Lord-
Jehovah: He Who was and is and is to come. His words, therefore,
may often have a past, present and future reference.

Prophecy frequently has all three: (1) the reference to the events
at the time of its utterance; (2) a subsequent reference to some great
crisis; and (3) a final consummation, which shall fulfil and exhaust it.

When a prophecy is said, therefore, to be “fulfilled,” that exhausts
it. In other cases, where that final fulfilment is still future, the quotation
is general-“as it is written,” or some such indefinite reference.

The mistake made by most students of prophecy consists in this:
that they do not bear in mind this threefold aspect of prophecy; but
take one part, and put it for the whole.

For example, with regard to the prophecy in Dan. 11:1-45 There
was a reference to Antiochus Epiphanes, now past; but this neither
fulfilled nor exhausted the prophecy; which waits for the yet future
revelation of one who shall fill it full: while there may be a historical
reference to the course of events between. Each is true as part of the
general fulfilment; but neither contains the whole truth embodied in the
fulness of the prophetic record.

An example of this may be seen in the very first recorded fulfilment
of prophecy in the New Testament (Mat. 1:23 below). We there see
how the same Holy Spirit who first inspired that prophecy afterwards
Himself interprets and applies it.

\

1. Where the sense originally intended by the Holy Spirit is

preserved, though the words may vary
Mat. 1:23.-“Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a
son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel.”

This prophecy was “spoken” by Isaiah to Ahaz (Isa. 7:13-14), and
afterwards written down. It was first spoken with special reference to
Ahaz and the circumstances then existing; but was afterwards fulfilled
and quoted with reference to the event which the prophet, who was
merely “the mouth,” did not understand, but which the Lord really
intended. The words differ from both the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX.
The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , but the sense is the same.

It never had or could have a proper fulfilment, except in Christ, for
no virgin ever conceived and bore a child. In the days of Isaiah a
certain woman, who was a virgin at the time when the prophecy was
uttered, afterwards brought forth a son, whom they were told to name
“Emmanuel”; and, before that child was old enough to know how to
refuse the evil and choose the good, the deliverance promised to King
Ahaz was wrought for him. But this prophecy did not have its complete
and proper fulfilment in the days of Ahaz, because a real virgin did not
conceive and bring forth a real Emmanuel.

This is not a prophecy, therefore, where the original sense is
modified; for this was the sense in which it was originally intended,
although there was a preliminary and partial fulfilment at the time.*

is preserved.

1Pe. 2:6.-Quoted from Isa. 28:16 (LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint

Version (325 b.c.).] ).

2. Where the original sense is modified in the quotation or

reference

Mat. 12:40.-Where, in the reference to Jon. 1:17 (2:1), the words are

used with a new and different application.

Joh. 3:14-15, where the words respecting the brazen serpent, though

not directly quoted, are modified in their new application.

Joh. 19:36.-“A bone of him shall not be broken.” Quoted from Exo.

12:46, where we have the words, “Neither shall ye break a bone

thereof.” That “another Scripture saith” this, is perfectly true, but not in

the same sense. It was said of the passover lamb, and it is here

modified and applied to Christ. (See 1Co. 5:7).

Eph. 5:31-32.-Where, in the reference to Gen. 2:23-24, the words are

used with a new application.
3. Where the sense is accommodated, being quite different from that
which was first intended, and the sense is accommodated by analogy
to quite a different event or circumstance

Hence this particular form of the figure is called ACCOMMODATIO.
Mat. 2:15.-“Out of Egypt have | called my son,” which agrees with the
Hebrew of Hos. 11:1, and not with the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint
Version (325 b.c.).] , which has “have | sent for his ({6., Israel's)
children.”

Mat. 2:17-18.-From Jer. 31:15 : but differs both from the Heb. and the
LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] (38:15). The sense
of each is given, but is accommodated to the new circumstances.

Mat. 8:17.-Quoted from Isa. 53:4, but differing from the LXX [Note: XX
The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , and exactly answering to the
Hebrew. The sense is accommodated; for, whereas the Spirit in Isaiah
uses the words of Christ bearing our spiritual infirmities and sins in His
passion and death (as shown in 1Pe. 2:24-25), the same Spirit uses
them in Matthew, and accommodates them to other circumstances,
viz., to Christ's healing people of their bodily sicknesses (Mat. 8:16).
But this only shows the wonderful fulness of the Divine words.
Mat. 13:35.-Quoted from Psa. 78:2 : but the sense in which Christ
used them was different from that in the Psalm, where they are used
of the past history of Israel: here they are accommodated by Christ,
the Speaker, to the present circumstances. The words are said to be
“fulfilled,” because, though the agent or speaker knew not of this
ultimate use of the words, the Holy Spirit, Who spake by him,
foreknew it. The words are said to be “spoken by the prophet,” and so
they were (see Psa. 78:1-2), though they were afterwards written
down.

The actual words differ both from the Heb. and the LXX [Note: XX
The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , 85 well as from the sense which
is accommodated to them.

Christ was making known concerning that Kingdom certain things
which would happen on its rejection. These things were not the
subject of Old Testament prophecy, but had been “kept secret,” and
are therefore called “the mysteries of (or secrets concerning) the
kingdom.”

Mat. 15:8-9.-Quoted from Isa. 29:13, according to the Septuagint, but
accommodated to different circumstances from those to which the
words referred when first spoken.

Mat. 27:9-10.-“Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah
the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.”

In the margin the reference given is Zec. 11:12-13 : but the words
differ so widely both from the Heb. and the Septuagint that it is more
than doubtful whether this can be the passage which is said to be
fulfilled.

As no such passage is found in Jeremiah, the difficulty is
supposed to be very great. As an example of misapplied ingenuity, we
give the various attempts which have been made by way of evading
the difficulty:

1. It was a mistake of Matthew’s memory. This was Augustine’s
opinion, followed by Alford, who says: “The citation is not from
Jeremiah, and is probably quoted from memory and unprecisely.”

2. The reading, “Jeremiah” is spurious. (Rupert von Deutz and
others).

3. It occurs in a work of Jeremiah’s which has been lost. (Origen
and others).

4. It was in Jeremiah, but the Jews have expunged it. (Eusebius).
5. That, Because Jeremiah, in the Talmud, and some MSS.,
commences the “latter” prophets, his name is put for the whole body
of their writings which would include Jeremiah. (Lightfoot, Adam Clark,
Scrivener, and others).

6. Wordsworth boldly asserts that the mistake was purposely
made; the name Jeremiah being substituted for Zechariah in order to
teach us not to depend on the prophets who were merely channels
and not the sources of Divine Truth.

Concerning this Alford says: “I put it to any faithful Christian to say,
whether of the two presents the greater obstacle to his faith, the
solution given above (see No. 1 above), or that given in Wordsworth’s
note.”

7. Others again think Matthew’s mistake arose from the Jewish
tradition “Zechariam habuisse spiritum Jeremioe” (“Zechariah had the
spirit of Jeremiah”).

Need we say, with regard to these seven, that

1. Is improbable: inasmuch as he quotes Zechariah elsewhere
(21:5, 26:31).
2. Is devoid of MS. authority, which is essential in a case of this
kind. Origen and Eusebius suspect it, but only conjecturally.

3. This, too, is only a conjecture.

4. So with this.

5. This has more weight, but is unlikely and unsatisfactory: so
evidently a make-shift.

6. We admire Wordsworth’s faith in the accuracy of the Bible more
than Alford’s free handling of the Word: but it is, after all, a wild
conjecture.
7. The same is the case with this.

Now these are just the sort of explanations which do more harm
than all the assaults of the enemies of the Bible. But they serve to
prove the truth of inspiration, in that the Bible still stands in spite of all
the defences of its friends!

If it be a quotation from Zechariah, it can be so only by
accommodation, or by composition (see below page 797, “composite
quotations”), in which case it combines four different quotations:-

(a) “They took the thirty pieces of silver,” which is derived from the
narrative, with special reference to Zechariah;

(0) “The price of him that was valued,” also after Zechariah.

(c) “Whom they bought of the children of Israel” (A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg.
{Note: arg. Margin.] ) as Joseph was bought and sold. After Gen.
37:1-36 :

(d) “And gave them for the potter’s field,” the narrative of the text,
with a special reference to Zechariah.

(e) “As the Lord appointed me,” which is from Jer. 32:6; Jer. 32:8,
and connects the transaction in Matthew with that in Jer. 32:1-44 A
field was bought in each case; and the latter, like the former, has
special reference to the future. Thus they treasured up a witness
against their own perfidy, while Jeremiah witnessed to the Lord’s
faithfulness.

But in reality, all these so-called explanations are utterly beside the
point, and are not only unnecessary, but absolutely worthless. The
mention of them here would be a waste of paper and printer’s ink,
except that they testify to the fact that, like most other difficulties, this
one is first invented and put into the text, and then it is wrestled with,
and the text wrested.

There is not a word about the prophecy being written in Jeremiah
at all. It says τὸ ῥηθέν (to rheethen) “that which was SPOKEN”: but
these clever critics practically take the trouble to exchange these two
words, and put in two others 6 γέγραπται (ho gegraptai), or ἦν
γεγραμµένον (een gegrammenon), “that which is written.” And then,
having made the assertion that it was written in Jeremiah, they have to
show cause why it cannot be found there.

Some prophecies were written and never (so far as we know)
spoken at all; others were both spoken and written; while some were
spoken and never written.
It says: “That which was SPOKEN by Jeremiah the prophet.”
Surely it is neither suspicion nor conjecture, nor “unprecise” to
maintain that it was thus “spoken.” Who can prove that it was not
“spoken by Jeremiah?”

True, Zechariah may have written down similar words, though not
referring to the same circumstances; but it ought never to have
occurred to anyone to say that Mat. 27:9-10 was quoted from what is
written by Zechariah, when it positively states that it was “spoken by
Jeremiah.”

Act. 13:40-41.-Quoted from Hab. 1:5, according to the LXX [Note: ХХ
The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , but accommodated to another set
of circumstances, and to the Romans rather than to the Chaldeans.
Rom. 9:27-28.-Quoted from Isa. 10:22-23, nearly according to the
LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

Rom. 9:29.-Quoted Isa. 1:9, according to the LXX. [Note: XX. The
Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

Rom. 10:6-8.-Where what the Scripture (or, rather, “the righteousness
which is of faith) “saith” (Deu. 30:12-14) is accommodated to different
circumstances-verses 6 and 8 agreeing with the LXX [Note: XX The
Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ‚ and verse 7 differing from it.
1Co. 1:19-20.-Quoted from Isa. 29:14; Isa. 33:18, and differing from
the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , as well as
accommodated to other circumstances.

1Co. 10:6; 1Co. 10:11.-“These things happened unto them for
ensamples.” Where the events cited are used and accommodated to
our sins and infirmities.

Rev. 1:7.-An allusion to Zec. 12:10.

Rev. 1:17.-An allusion to Isa. 41:4; Isa. 44:6, but differing from the
LXxX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

Rev. 11:4.-Quoted from Zec. 4:14, differing both from the Heb. and the
LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ‚ and
accommodated to different circumstances.

Il. As to their External form (i.e., the words, as distinct from the

sense)

1. Where the words are from the Hebrew, or from the Septuagint
Mat. 2:15, from Hos. 11:1; Mat. 2:6, from Mic. 5:2 (1); Mat. 12:18-21,
from Isa. 42:1-4. These and other passages are from the Hebrew and
not from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]
Luk. 4:18 quoted from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).] of Isa. 61:1-2. We have already instanced this as a
citation in which the original sense is preserved. But we repeat it here
because the words are varied.

“The Spirit of the Lord (Heb., Adonai Jehovah) is upon me
because he (Heb., Jehovah) hath anointed me to preach the Gospel
to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind.” Thus
far we have the words of the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).] The last sentence “the recovering of sight to the blind,” not
being in the Hebrew Text* [Note: See Ginsburg’s Hebrew Bible, which
gives two readings.] ; while the last sentence in the Hebrew is not in
the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] But the two
words in the Hebrew contain both senses. 22? (pahkach) means
simply to open. Spoken once of the ears (58. 42:20); and often of the
eyes (2Ki. 4:35; 2Ki. 6:17; 2Ki. 6:20; 2Ki. 19:16. Dan. 9:18. Job. 27:19.
Pro. 20:13. Jer. 32:19. Isa. 42:7). Hence the first of the two words
means to open the eyes of: and the other word means prison. Thus, in
reading, the sense of the first word was expanded and given in the
words of Isa. 42:7; while that of the second word was expanded and
given in the words of Isa. 58:6 -the two together meaning that the eyes
of the prisoners should be opened on being released from the
darkness of their prison. Or, to open [their eyes, and open or release]
the prisoners. The explanation lies in the fact that the eyelids were
called “the doors” of the eyes (222222, aphappayim) (Psa. 132:4.
Pro. 6:4. Job. 16:16, etc.). Hence the term “to open” applies equally to
the eyes and to prison doors.
2. Where the words are varied by omission, addition, or
transposition

Mat. 4:10 and Luk. 4:8.-“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,” from
Deu. 6:13; Deu. 10:20; and then the Lord added His own Divine
conclusion from this: “And Him only shalt thou serve.”

The Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.).] have “fear”: but the fear of God includes the worship of God;
and as worship was the matter in question (see Mat. 4:9), the
φοβηθήση (phobeetheesee), thou shalt fear, of the LXX. [Note: XX.
The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] is changed by the Lord to
προσκυνήσεις (proskuneeseis), thou shalt worship.
Mat. 4:15-16, from Isa. 9:1-2 (8:23; 9:1). Here, the quotation differs
both from the Hebrew and from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint
Version (325 b.c.).] But this is partly an accommodation; because in
Isaiah (LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ) it is
prophecy, while in the Gospel it is fulfilment that is in question.

Mat. 5:31, from Deu. 24:1 : but here it is not given as an exact
quotation. It introduces the words by the simple formula: “It hath been
said,” implying that those who thus said, put their own meaning on
what the Law said.

Mat. 12:18-21, from Isa. 42:1-4. Here, the Gospel differs from the LXX
{Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] , scarcely a word being
the same till we come to the last clause. It differs, too, from the
Hebrew in the last clause, because it records the act of “fulfilment,”
and not merely the words of the prophecy. The words, therefore take
the form of a Divine comment or re-statement.

Mat. 19:5.-“And they twain” (οἱ δύο, hoi duo). These words are added
to the usual text of Gen. 2:24 : and yet the sense is the same, for only
of two were these words spoken. The quotation agrees with the LXX.
[Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

Mat. 22:24.-From Deu. 25:5-6. But here it is the Sadducees, who do
not quote, but merely give the substance of the matter under the loose
formula “Moses said.”

Rom. 11:3-4.-From 1Ki. 19:10; 1Ki. 19:14; 1Ki. 19:18. Here neither the
Heb. nor the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] is
followed, but the facts are recorded; while the destruction of the altars
and the killing of the prophets are transposed.

1Co. 2:9.-From Isa. 64:4 (3). It is clear from this that the formula, “As it
is written,” refers to the sense rather than to the words; and that the
Divine Author, in repeating the words, sometimes varied them, as He
does here; first, by transposing the hearing and the seeing; and then,
by adding “neither have entered into the heart of man,” thus varying
both from the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).]

Moreover, He employs the general sentiment in a particular case.
For what is said in the abstract, and universally, in Isaiah, is here put
in contrast to some particular things which are revealed. See verse 10.
1Со. 14:21.-From Isa. 28:11-12. Here the quotation differs both from
the Heb. and the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] :
and is accommodated to the new circumstances by the omission of
the middle passage, which was not relevant.
1Pe. 1:24-25.-From Isa. 40:6-8. Here the words are not introduced by
any formula as a quotation. Isa. 40:1-31 is referred to; and certain
words are used again by the same Author: and, therefore, some are
omitted; as not being relevant, or necessary for the purpose in hand.
3. Where the words are changed by a reading, or an inference; or
in number, person, mood, or tense

We all constantly thus quote the Scriptures: and, in adapting them by
application to some special circumstance, we depart from the original
interpretation as to the special circumstances connected with them,
and do not hesitate to change a tense, or number, or person, etc.

It is no less authoritative, as Scripture, nor does it alter the word of
God.

(a) By a different reading

Heb. 10:5 (7).-“A body hast thou prepared me.”

These words are like the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).] of Psa. 40:6 (39:6), and differ from the Hebrew, which is,
“Mine ears hast thou opened.”
But this is not given as a quotation. It does not say, “as it is
written”; but it gives the words which “he saith,” “when he cometh into
the world.” What he then said in the accomplishment of a prophecy
must certainly differ from the form in which the event was foretold and
written centuries before.

What we have here is an adaptation or accommodation (see
above page 786) of a prophecy; and the words are changed to make it
suit the actual fulfilment of the prophecy.

It consists of four lines arranged alternately:-

а “Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;

Ь Mine ears hast thou opened:

а Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required;

Ь — Then said I, Lo, | come ... to do thy will, О my God.”

Here in a and a we have sacrifices; while in b and b we have
obedience.

This is another statement of the truth in 1Sa. 15:22 :

a “To obey

Ь — 15 better than sacrifice,
а And to hearken
Ь — Than the fat of rams.”

Here, again, we have obedience and sacrifice set in contrast. And
that is exactly what we have in Heb. 10:5, except that the obedience is
differently expressed.

In Psa. 40:6, the symbol is the opening or boring of the ears, which
is in harmony with Isa. 50:5; Isa. 48:8; and an allusion to Exo. 19:5;
Exo. 21:5-6; and Deu. 15:16-17; while the contrast is in harmony with
198. 15:22 and Jer. 7:22. The boring of the ears signifies the voluntary
acceptance of bond-service, and the promise to perform it. But in Heb.
10:5 we have not the promise (as in Psa. 40:6), but the actual
performance, and therefore the words are changed by the One who
came to do that will of God. Surely He had the right to change them,
and to state as a fact, “A body hast thou prepared me” in which to
obey, and by that perfect obedience unto death to do that which is
“better than sacrifice.” The “great delight” (1Sa. 15:22) of the Father is
expressed in Mat. 3:17, as well as foretold in Isa. 42:1.

Heb. 11:21.-This is not a quotation; but, as it is generally treated as
such, and as being in discrepancy with Gen. 47:31, we refer the
reader to Hysteresis (q.v. [Note: Which see-] ).

(b) By an inference
Mat. 2:6.-Here we have several changes by way of inference and
explanation, bringing out more of the meaning of the words in the
prophet. Mic. 5:2 (1) reads (R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ):
“But thou Bethlehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the
thousands of Judah, out of thee shall One come forth unto me that is
to be ruler in Israel.”

In Mat. 2:6 we have “land of Judah” instead of Ephrathah, which
was its ancient name (see Gen. 35:16-19; Gen. 48:7), as being better
understood by Herod.

Instead of the positive “art little,” we have the negative, “art in no
wise least,” because, though little in the time of Micah, yet now, after
the birth of the Messiah (Mat. 1:1-25), it could no longer be so called,
in view of the event which had given the city true greatness.

Instead of “thousands,” we have the Metonymy (q.v. [Note: Which
see.] ), properly translated “princes,” because Messiah was the Prince
of princes.

Instead of “be ruler,” we have “be shepherd of” (A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] rule,
margin feed). This explanation brings in the next verse but one in
Micah (“He shall stand and shall feed.”)
Finally, the words of the prophet, “unto me,” are omitted, because
the emphasis is now on the fact rather than the purpose (though both
were true); and hence the reason is given in the word “for,” and the
fact is added in the words, “my people.”
Act. 7:43.-Here the citation differs both from the Hebrew and LXX
[Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] (Amo. 5:25-27) in
words; but, by Divine inference other facts and truths are referred to.

Instead of using the Hebrew name “Chiun,” in Amo. 5:26, the
Greek equivalent, “Remphan,” is used.* [Note: Just as “Ethiopia” is
used for the Hebrew “Koosh”; “Egypt” for “Mizraim’; “Syria” and
“Mesopotania’” for the Hebrew “Aram.”]

Instead of saying “the figures which ye made for yourselves,” the
object for which they were made is given by Him, who knew their
hearts-“figures which ye made to worship them,” thus bringing out and
emphasising their idolatry.

Instead of saying “beyond Damascus,” Stephen says: “beyond
Babylon.” But this is no “scribal error,” or “inadvertence,” as critics
assert.

Even the stoutest defenders of verbal inspiration read both Amos
and Acts, as though they both “referred to the Babylonian exile,” and
do not appear to notice that it says” beyond” Babylon.

The fact is that it is “the house of Israel” as distinct from Judah that
is spoken of in Act. 7:42, and in Amos; and, while Judah was taken
away to Babylon, Israel was taken “beyond” Babylon. Amos speaking
before either captivity (about 780 b.c.) says: “beyond Damascus’; or,
beyond where Damascus will go captive. See Amo. 1:5.

In other words, in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit alludes to the
country, and refers to Assyria, and says “beyond Damascus”; while
speaking by Stephen, in the light of all the past history, He alludes to
the fact that Israel was removed farther than Judah, for while Judah
was taken away fo Babylon, Israel was removed “beyond” it.

Rom. 9:27.-“Though the number of the children of Israel be as the
sand of the sea” (so LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.).] ). In Isa. 10:22 it is, “Though thy People Israel be as the sand of
the sea,” etc. Here, by way of inference, the same people are
mentioned in other words.

Rom. 9:29 is referred to as a difference in reading. “Except the Lord of
Sabaoth had left us a seed” (σπέρµα, sperma). In Isa. 1:9 it is “Except
the Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant (2222, sareed), but
sareed means the same thing exactly, though the words differ. The
seed that is left will form the remnant, and the “remnant” that is left will
consist of the “seed.”

Rom. 9:33.-“Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.” This,
in Isa. 28:16, is “He that believeth shall not make haste.”
The Hebrew (222, chiish), means to flee, flee away, hence, of
the feelings, to be excited. Rom. 9:33 is the Divine inference from this,
for he who really believes has no need for fleeing or for excitement;
but can patiently wait for and expect the fulfilment of the Divine
promises. Hence, he will have no ground for that shame which causes
others to run away.

Eph. 4:8.-This is supposed to be a case where there is a difference of
reading. The English is: “and gave gifts unto men.” But the Hebrew of
Psa. 68:18 (19) is: “Thou hast received gifts for men.”

In the Psalm we have the prophecy “that Jah Elohim might dwell
among them”; while in the Epistle we have the fulfilment in the gifts
received being “actually” given, and the Lord God dwelling in the midst
of His People by the Holy Spirit. But apart from this it ought to be
noted that the Hebrew °??? (/akach) has the double and beautiful
sense of first receiving and then giving: i.e., receive and give what is
received. Hence it is often rendered “to fetch.” See Gen. 18:5; Gen.
27:13; Gen. 42:16. Exo. 27:20 “bring.” Lev. 24:2 “bring.” 2Ki. 2:20
“bring.”
We ought, however, to note that in the Psalm we have 2222
(baadam) with the article: i.e., in the man. So that we may render it:
“Thou didst receive gifts in human nature”: i.e., as “the Son of man”
(compare Mat. 28:18. Joh. 13:3). He did give gifts to men.

(c) In number
Mat. 4:7.-“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” In Deu. 6:16 it is:
“Ye shall not tempt.” If the command is given to all in general, then
surely it applies to each individual in particular: and so the Lord
applied it in reply to the Tempter.
Rom. 4:7.-“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.” In Psa.
32:1 it is in the singular number: “Blessed is he,” etc.

But this is not a direct quotation. It is introduced by the words:
“David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God
imputed righteousness without works [saying] Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the
man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.”

But in the Hebrew the word “man” (22?) does not occur until
verse 2. In verse 1 it is literally “O the happinesses of the forgiven of
transgression: the covered of sin.” And this singular may be used of a
forgiven People collectively, and be Divinely expanded according to its
sense: “Blessed are they.”

In both places the plural is meant, the singular being put for it in
the former case only by Synecdoche (q.v. [Νοίε: Which see-] ).

Rom. 10:15.-“How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
Gospel of peace.”

In Isa. 52:7 the Heb. is “the feet of him,” the singular being put by
Synecdoche for the plural, just as “the feet” are put (the part for the
whole) for the person who preaches.

(d) In person
Examples of this may be found under Heterosis of Person. See above,
where one person is put for another.
(e) In mood and tense
Examples of this may be found under Heterosis of the Verb. See
above.

One illustration may be given in Mat. 13:14-15, where (in the
quotation of Isa. 6:10) the indicative mood is put by Heterosis for the
imperative.
4. Where several citations are amalgamated. Composite
quotations
Sometimes a number of separate sentences are drawn from different
passages and presented as one connected passage.

This is a common use practised generally in all literature. Dr.
Franklin Johnson* [Note: The Quotations of the New Testament from
the Old considered in the light of general literature, pp. 92-102.] gives
some interesting examples from various authors.

Plato, in his /оп (p. 538), quotes two lines from Homer pieced
together by Plato himself, the first from liad xi., line 638; and the
second, line 630, col. 629.

Xenophon (Memorabilia, bk. |., ch. 2, sec. 58) quotes connectedly
as one passage, two passages from Homer (Iliad ii., 188 5αα. [Note:
qq. Following.] and 198 sqq. [Note: qq. Following.]

Lucian, in his Charon (sec. 22), runs five lines together from
Homer. But Jacobitzt [Note: Lucian i., p. 39.] shows that they are
brought together from different passages: viz.: Iliad ix. 319, 320, and
Odyssey x. 521; xi. 539.

Plutarch, in his treatise on Progress in Virtue, treats two separate
lines of Homer as a single sentence, viz., Odyssey vi. 187 and xxiv.
402.

Cicero, in De Oratore, book ΙΙ., sec. 80, quotes from the Andria of
Terence, making up in two lines parts of Terence’s lines 117, 128 and
129.

Philo, in his treatise, Who is the heir of divine things? sec. 5,
quotes, as one address of Moses, parts of two, viz., Num. 11:13; Num.
22:1-41, but both refer to the same matter.

In the same treatise (sec. 46) he runs together parts of Gen.
18:14; Gen. 17:19.
Conybeare and Howson (Life and Epistles of St. Paul, vol. Ι., p.
54) quote, as one passage, parts of Psa. 122:4; Psa. 68:27 (28);
122:5, 2, 6, 7; and 68:35 (36). And these are not accompanied by any
references or explanation.

Ruskin, in his Modern Painters, vol. V., p. 146, quotes as one
passage: “How | love thy law! It is my meditation all the day. Thy
testimonies are my delight and my counsellors; sweeter also than
honey and the honeycomb.” All these four sentences are from the
Psalms. The first two are from Psa. 119:97; Psa. 119:24; Psa. 19:10
(11).

All these composite quotations are made up of sentences that
relate to the same subject. And this is always true of those which we
find in the Scriptures.

Not so when man quotes the Scriptures in this manner. When he
thus strings texts together it is a very different matter; and, though
sometimes harmless, it is often dangerous, and is a practice greatly to
be deprecated. By a system, which may be called text-garbling, he is
able to support his own theories and views.

We recently saw two texts (quotations) thus connected in order to
support Fasting, though they relate to totally distinct subjects: “The
Lord Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights. Do this in remembrance
of Me.” This is a flagrant example, but less likely to harm than many
others which are less glaring and more specious.

Quite different are those examples in which the Holy Spirit Himself
takes His own words and thus links them together, making one subject
of them, even though that subject cannot be discerned by us in the
separate passages.

The following are examples:-

Mat. 21:5.-“Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king cometh unto
thee,” etc.

This is a composite quotation, the first sentence, “Tell ye,” etc.,
being taken from Isa. 62:11, and the latter contracted from Zec. 9:9.

In Mat. 21:13 (Mar. 11:17, and Luk. 19:46), the Lord exclaimed: “It is
written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have
made it a den of thieves.” The first half of this is from Isa. 56:7, and
the second slightly altered from Jer. 7:11. In both passages (which
agree with the LXX [Note: XX The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).] ) the
subject is the same; viz., the Temple, and the right use of it.

Mar. 1:2-3.-“As it is written in the prophets, Behold,” etc.
The prophets quoted are Mal. 3:1, and Isa. 40:3.
Luk. 1:16-17 is from Mal. 4:5-6 (3:23, 24) and 3:1.
Act. 1:20 is made up from Psa. 69:25 (26), and 109:8, and differs both
from the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325
b.c.)]
Rom. 3:10-18 is a long quotation made up of the following passages,
which all refer to the same subject. They are composed of two
classes, the general and the particular; verses 10-12 are taken from
Ecc. 7:20. Psa. 14:2-3; Psa. 53:2-3 (3, 4), which speak generally of
the universality of sin; while the second kind, verses 13-18, taken from
Psa. 5:9 (10). Isa. 59:7-8, and Psa. 36:1 (2) proves the same thing;
being the manifestations of sin in particular cases. Thus two methods
of proof by induction are employed: and yet some, “forgetting their
logic” (as Dr. Franklin Johnson says), see a difficulty in this simple
method of proof which is common to all writers of all ages, and of
various languages.

It should be noted that in these cases the reasoning is always
correctly from the general to the particular; and not, as is so often the
case with man, from the particular to the general: which is false in
logic and fatal as to the argument.
Rom. 9:33 is made up from Isa. 28:16; Isa. 8:14. Varied both from the
Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]
Rom. 11:8 is made up from Isa. 29:10 and Deu. 29:4.

Rom. 11:26-27 is made up from Isa. 59:20-21; Isa. 27:9, and agreeing
with the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]

1Co. 15:54-55 is made up from Isa. 25:8, and Hos. 13:14, and varied
both from the Heb. and the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version
(325 b.c.).]

2Co. 6:16 is made up from Lev. 26:11-12 and Eze. 37:27, and is
varied from the LXX. [Note: XX. The Septuagint Version (325 b.c.).]
Gal. 3:8 is made up from Gen. 12:3; Gen. 18:18.

Heb. 9:19-20 is made up from Exo. 24:6-8, and Num. 19:6.

1Pe. 2:7 is made up from Psa. 118:22 and Isa. 8:14.

Objectors have made a difficulty of these composite quotations, as
though the Holy Spirit, the Author of the words as well as of the Word,
may not repeat, vary, or combine His words in any way He pleases:
and as though He were to be denied the right claimed and practised
by writers in all ages.
So far from seeing a difficulty in this, we may learn many important
lessons from these variations, which are nothing less than Divine
Comments on the Divine Word by the Divine Author.

5. Where quotations are front secular works, or books other than
the Bible

Sometimes the Holy Spirit quotes words from secular and human

writings, and either thus endorses the truth of the statement, or uses it

against those who believed it and accepted it as truth.

Not all, however, that are generally considered as quotations are
really so. For example: “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses”
(2Ti. 3:8) is said to be a quotation from the Targum of Jonathan ben
Uzziel upon Exo. 7:11. But the Holy Spirit may give this independently,
as a fact, quite apart from the Targum altogether; while many believe
the Targum to be of a later date.

So, too, the prophecy of Enoch in Jud. 1:14-15 may just as well be
the foundation on which the so-called “Book of Enoch” was afterwards
made up, as a quotation made from that book. We certainly prefer to
believe that the book of Enoch was originated from Jud. 1:14-15; and,
taking this as the starting point, other prophecies were concocted and
added by some old and unknown writer.

The same applies to Jud. 1:9 concerning the controversy between
Michael and the Devil about the body of Moses. This Scriptural
statement was the original centre round which numberless fancies and
fictions subsequently gathered, and from which the traditions started.

On the other hand, there are three certain undoubted
quotationsfrom secular writings. We will give them all.

The first is:-

Act. 17:28.-“For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as
certain also of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his
offspring’ (τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν, tou gar kai genos esmen).” This is
an exact quotation from Aratus, a native of Tarsus; who, being a poet,
had been requested by Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, and
King of Macedonia (273-239 b.c.), to put into poetry an astronomical
work of Eudoxus (an astronomer of Cnidus, 403-350 b.c.), called
Phainomena. This he did about 270 b.c., and he called his work
Diosemeia (i.e., the Divine signs), being a description and explanation
of the signs of the Zodiac, and the Constellations, as the Greeks then
understood, or rather misunderstood, them.* [Note: See The Witness
of the Stars, by the same author and publisher.] The poem opens with
praise of God (Zeus or Jupiter), and these words occur in the fifth
line:-
“From Zeus we lead the strain; He whom mankind
Ne’er leave unhymned; of Zeus all public ways,

All haunts of men, are full; and full the sea,

And harbours; and of Zeus all stand in need.

We are his off spring; and he, ever good to man,
Gives favouring signs, and rouses us to toil,” etc., etc.

Similar words, ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν (ek sou gar genos esmen)
are used by Kleanthes (Hymn in Jov. 5), who was born at Assos in
Troas about 300 b.c. Also in The Golden Verses of Pythagoras.

In Act. 17:28, the word “poets,” being in the plural; may refer to
both of them, while the article in both cases refers to Zeus, or Jupiter.
The statement of the quotation was believed by the Greeks, and it is
used here as an argumentum ad hominem. For it could never be that
Zeus is really Jehovah, or that Jehovah is the “father” of everyone.
The “universal fatherhood of God’”-the Devil's lie-was the belief of the
heathen, as well as of most modern “Christian” teachers. But both are
wrong: for God is “the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and of those
only who are “in Christ.” It is to “as many as received Him, to them
[and to none other] gave He authority to be called the sons of God”
(Joh. 1:12).
1Co. 15:33.-“Evil communications (or companionships) corrupt good
manners.”

φθείρουσιν ἤθη χρήσθ᾽ ὁμιλίαι кака! (phtheirousin eethee
chreesth’ homiliai kakai). The words occur in this form, according to
Jerome,t [Note: In his Epistle to the Orator Magnus.] in the Thais of
Menander. Dr. Burton thinks Menander may have quoted it from
Euripides. Meyer quotes Plato (Rep. 8:550B).

These various opinions show that the words were current as a
common place quotation (Paroemia, q.v. [Νοίε: Which see.] ), and are
quoted as such here.

Tit. 1:12.-“One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, ‘The
Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies’ (i.e., liars, evil wild-
beasts, gluttons, lazy). This involves another figure called Oxymoron
(α.ν. [Note: Which see.] ). Jerome¥ [Note: Com. in loco.] says that the
poet was Epimenides, and that the words occur in his work called de
Oraculis (i.e., of Oracles), whence he is called a “prophet,” either by
way of irony, or because of the title of his work. Callimachus (a poet of
Cyrene) makes use of these words in a hymn to Jupiter, and satirizes
the Cretans for their boast that Jupiter was buried in Crete, whereas
he maintains (of course) that Jove was immortal. It was from this that
Ovid said ‘Nec fingunt omnia Ογείες’ (The Cretans do not always lie*
[Note: See Ovid, A. iii. 10, 19. Ellicott refers to Ovid, de A. А., i. 298.
This says “quamvis sit mendax, Creta negare potest.” ).

The origin of all this was that the Cretans had a certain sepulchre
with this epitaph: “Here lies one whom they call Jupiter.”

Because of this, the “Poet” charges them with a lie, saying: “the
Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies; therefore (O Jupiter)
they have built a Sepulchre for you. But thou hast not died, ... thou
always livest,” etc.

But it has been pointed out (by Archbishop Whately, we believe),
that if the Cretans are always liars, this was said by a Cretan,
therefore he must have been a liar, and what he said could not be
true! But all this reasoning is set at rest by the Holy Ghost, who says:
“This testimony is true!”
In Act. 17:22-23, we have not, indeed, a quotation, but a reference to
a matter on which contemporary and later writers give confirmatory
and interesting evidence. “I perceive that in all things ye are unusually
religious. For, as | passed by and carefully observed your objects of
worship, | found an altar also with this inscription; Ἀγνώστῳ θεῷ
(Agnost6 the6) ‘to an unknown God.’ Whom therefore, not knowing, ye
reverence, him | make known to you.”

Jeromet [Note: Epist. ad Magnum Oratorem Romanum. Vol. Ill.
Operum, f. 148.] says (speaking of St. Paul); “He learned of the true
David to snatch the sword from the enemy’s hand, and cut off his head
with his own weapon.”

Ludovicus Vives says} [Note: De Civit, Dei. Book VII., cap. 17.]

that “in the Attic fields there were very many altars dedicated to
unknown Gods,” and that “Pausanias in his Attics, speaks of The
Altars of Unknown Gods, which altars were the invention of
Epimenides, the Cretan. For, when Attica was visited with a sore
plague, they consulted the Delphian Oracle, whose answer was
reported to be: That they must offer sacrifices, but named not the god
to whom they should be offered. Epimenides, who was then at Athens,
commanded§ [Note: Hence called ‘a prophet’ in Tit. 1:12. See The
Man of God, by the same author and publisher.] that they should send
the beasts intended for the sacrifice through the fields, and that the
sacrificers should follow the beasts with this direction: that, wherever
they should stand, there they must be sacrificed to the unknown god,
in order to pacify his wrath. From that time, therefore, to the time of
Diogenes Laertius these altars were visited.* [Note: For further
information on this subject, see Sixtus Senensis, book 2, Biblioth Tit.
Arce Athenensis Inscriptio. Also Wolfius, Vol. Ι., Lectionum
Memorabilium, p. 4, 5:20, etc.]

Col. 2:21.-“Touch not; taste not; handle not.” These ordinances of
men were probably prescribed in these words, and are referred to as
well known. We know them also to-day; for man is the same, and
human nature is not changed.

Amphibologia; or, Double Meaning
A Word or Phrase susceptible of two Interpretations

Am-phib-o-log’-i-a, from the Greek Gugi (amphi), on both sides, βόλος
(bolos), a throw, and λόγος (logos), a word; hence ἀμφιβολογία is a
word Or phrase susceptible of two interpretations. It is not
