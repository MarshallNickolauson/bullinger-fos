5. As to Feeling
Pathopeela; or, Pathos
The Expression of Feeling or Emotion
Path’-o-poe-i-a. Greek, паботпойа, from πάθος (pathos), a feeling or
passion, and ποιεῖν (poiein), to make.

This figure is so called, because the writer or speaker manifests
some pathos or emotion: or betrays some strong and excited condition
of mind.

It is of four kinds:-

Two arising out of pleasure: love and joy. And
Two arising out of pain: hatred and sorrow.
Examples, which are too many and too long to be quoted in full,
may be found in Isa. 22:4; Isa. 49:15. Jer. 9:1-2; Jer. 23:9-10; Jer.
31:20. Hos. 11:8-9. Mar. 3:5; Mar. 7:34; Mar. 10:14; Mar. 10:21. Luk.

Aste|smos; or, Urbanity
An Expression of Feeling by way of Politeness
As-te-is’-mos. Greek, ἀστεϊσμός, refined or polite talk; clever, witty, or
pleasing language; graceful or happy turn of phrase.

It is from ἀστεῖος (asteios), of the town (from ἄστυ (astu), city): 1.Θ.,
the polite and genteel expressions of society: Urbanity as opposed to
Rusticity.
