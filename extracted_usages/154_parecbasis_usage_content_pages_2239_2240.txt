A parenthesis is really part of the same subject, but Parecbasis is
a stepping aside to another.

Gen. 2:8-15, is a Parecbasis: i.e., a digression, or change of subject-
matter, by which the provision made by God for man’s habitation is
described.

The original subject is then resumed in verse 16, from verse 7.
Gen. 36:1-43 is a Parecbasis, a turning aside from “the generations of
Isaac” (Gen. 25:19-34; Gen. 26:1-35; Gen. 27:1-46; Gen. 28:1-22;
Gen. 29:1-35; Gen. 30:1-43; Gen. 31:1-55; Gen. 32:1-32; Gen.
33:1-20; Gen. 34:1-31; Gen. 35:1-29) to “the generations of Esau”
(Gen. 36:1-8), and “the generations of Esau, in Mount Seir,” etc. (9-43)
before continuing “the generations of Jacob” in 37.

Gen. 38:1-30 is a Parecbasis, a stepping aside from the history of
Joseph in order to introduce an episode in the life of Judah. So that
Joseph’s life, which began in 37, is not resumed till 39.

Rom. 1:1-32 -The opening verses of this Epistle form a beautiful
Parecbasis. № is caused by the structure of the Epistle: in which 1:2-6
has for its subject “God’s Gospel,” which was never hidden, but was
always revealed (corresponding with 16:25-27, the subject of which is
“the Mystery,” which was never revealed, but always hidden).
Chap. 1:1 is, therefore, properly part of the epistolary subject,
which is resumed in verse 7 and continued to verse 15 (corresponding
with the Epistolary portion at the end, 15:15-16:24): and chap. 1:2-6 is,
therefore, a Parecbasis, and is thus made to correspond with the
closing chap. 16:25-27* [Note: See the structure of the whole Epistle
under Correspondence (page 385).] ; while verse 7 is the continuation
of verse 1, and not of verse 6.

Such digressions as this often arise out of, and form part of, the
Structures or Correspondences of which the Scripture is made up: and
the figure Parecbasis must be studied in connection with them.

Metabasis; or, Transition
A passing from one subject to another
Me-tab’-a-sis. Greek, µετάβασις, from µετά (meta), beyond or over,
and βαΐνειν (bainein), to step or go, a stepping from one thing to
another.
