It is called also CONTENTIO: i.e., comparison, or contrast.

When this contrast is made by affirmatives and negatives, it is
called Enantiosis, see below.

The Book of Proverbs so abounds in such Antitheses that we have
not given any examples from it.
Isa. 1:21.-Of Jerusalem it is said “Righteousness lodged in it; but now
murderers [lodge in if].
Isa. 59:9.-

“We wait for the light, but behold obscurity;
For brightness, but we walk in darkness.”

Isa. 65:13-14.-Where we have many beautiful Antitheses. See also
under Symploce.
Lam. 1:1.-“How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people!”
Luk. 2:14.-“Glory in the highest to God, and on earth peace.” And
then, after these two Antitheta, a third fact is stated as resulting from
them when coming together:-“Good will toward men.”* [Note: Is it not
clear that ciéUs (eudokia) refers to Divine complacency, and that we
find the explanation in the ὁ οθ.ὴ (eudokeesa) of Mat. 3:17; Mat.
12:18; Mat. 17:5. Mar. 1:11. Luk. 3:22. 2Pe. 1:7? With these, contrast

See under Ellipsis:
Rom. 5:18.-“Therefore as through one offence judgment came upon
all men to condemnation, even so too, through the righteous act ("П 0
‹ поё " {1 ) of one, the free gift came upon all men unto а
justifying ("1"), spoken only of God's activity in justifying us) of life”
(or, a life-long justifying).t [Note: See articles on Romans in Things to
Come, Vol. V.]
Rom. 5:19.-“For as by one man’s disobedient act many were made
sinners, so by the obedient act of one (i.e., His death) shall many be
made righteous.”

See also Paronomasia and Paregmenon.
Rom. 6:7-8.-“For he that died, has been justified from sin. Now, if we
died with Christ, we believe that we shall live also with him.”
Rom. 8:5.-“For they that are (or live) after (or according to) flesh (the
Old nature) do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are (or live)
after (according to) spirit (the New nature) [do mina] the things of the
spirit”: i.e., the things that belong to the New nature. See under
Metonymy.
Rom. 8:13.-“For if ye live according to flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
through spirit (the New nature) do mortify the deeds of the body ({6.,
by reckoning that it died with Christ, Rom. 6:11), ye will live.”
Rom. 15:12.-“There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise
[and raise His banner] to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the
Gentiles trust.” The reference is to Isa. 11:10 : where ai (neys), a
banner, which is raised aloft, is put in contrast with the “roof” which is
the lowest point. So Messiah rises from the lowest to the highest.
2Co. 4:17-18 contains several beautiful Antitheses.
2Co. 6:8-10 contains a series of beautiful Antitheses.
In 2Co. 6:4-5 -, we have a seven-fold passive experience:-

patience,

afflictions,

necessities,

distresses,

stripes,

imprisonments,

tumults

In 20ο. 6:5-6-, we have a seven-fold self-denial:

labours,

watchings,

fastings,

pureness,
knowledge,

longsuffering.

kindness.

In 20ο. 6:6; 20ο. 6:8 -, we have a seven-fold means to елаиге:-

the Holy Ghost,

love unfeigned,

the word of truth,

the power of God,

the armour of righteousness,

honour and dishonour,

evil report and good report.

In 2Co. 6:8-10, we have a seven-fold result in the following

Antitheses:—

deceivers, and yet true;

unknown, yet well-known;

dying, yet living;

chastened, yet not killed;

sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;

poor, yet enriching others;

having nothing, yet possessing all things.
Php. 3:7.-“But what things were gain to me, those | counted loss for
Christ.”

Note that, by Antithesis, our attention is called to the fact that Paul
is here speaking, by the Spirit, of his “gains,” not of his sins. Of his
gains, as a man and an Israelite; which included the hope of
resurrection as well as righteousness, of course: but he was willing to
give them all up for that righteousness which he had in Christ, and for
that “out-rising from among the dead,” which he should have at
Christ's appearing.

He does not, in verse 11, speak of something which he could attain
to as a Christian more than other Christians; but he is contrasting his
“gains,” as a Jew, and putting them in Antithesis with his greater gains
as a Christian.
2Pe. 2:19.-“While they promise them (i.e. their dupes) liberty, they
themselves are the servants of corruption.”
