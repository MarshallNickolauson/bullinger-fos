Pragmatographia; or, Description of Actions
Prag’-mat-o-graph’-i-a, from πρᾶγμα (pragma), an action or event,
and γράφειν (graphein), to write: [.Θ., a description of an action or
event. Hence, called by the Latins, REI AUT ACTIONIS DESCRIPTIO.

See Joe. 2:1-11, where the description of the actions connected
with the great people and strong which should come upon Zion is
minutely and graphically given.

Mat. 24:1-51 and Mar. 13:1-37 describe the events of the Great
Tribulation; and Luk. 21:12, etc., the events which should long
precede it.

See also some minute touches, especially in the Gospel of Mark:
e.g., 8:33; and Act. 6:15; Act. 7:55-56.

When the description is confined to places, it is called
Topographia; or, Description of Place
Top’-o-graph а, from τόπος (top’-os), a place, and урафем
(graphein), to write or describe.
