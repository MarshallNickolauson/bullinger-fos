Isa. 1:11; Isa. 1:13.-“To what purpose is the multitude of your
sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: | am full of the burnt offerings of
rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and | delight not in the blood of
bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats ... Bring no more vain oblations;
incense is an abomination unto me.”
One sentence would have expressed the whole, “your sacrifices
are not pleasing to me.” But, by the figure Synathroesmos, all kinds of
sacrifices are enumerated, and the sense is thus amplified and
emphasized to show that, with all their outward show of “religion,”
there was no true worship of the spirit and heart.

So with the feasts, in verse 14, and with prayers, in verse 15.

The figure is used here to emphasize the fact that religious
ordinances and services are nothing in themselves.

In the days of our Lord there was plenty of “religion”: Isa. 1:1-31
describes the abundance of it; but there was no heart in it. It was all
form! and it was these very religious people (and not the rabble) who
crucified the Lord!

Isa. 3:16-23.-Неге, the various ornaments of women are heaped
together, to heighten the effect, and to emphasize the awful judgment
of verses 24-4:1.

Rom. 1:29-31.-Here, many abominations of the heathen are
enumerated to show what is the outcome of the “reprobate mind.”

There are other figures in this passage. See under Paronomasia,
Ellipsis, and Asyndeton.

It will be easy to recognize this figure whenever it is met with.
1Ti. 4:1-3.-Here, is an enumeration of the characters which will make
the “latter times” so perilous. Also in
2Ti. 3:1-7, we have another enumeration.
1Pe. 4:3.-Here, are enumerated the things which characterize the
condition of the Gentiles.
