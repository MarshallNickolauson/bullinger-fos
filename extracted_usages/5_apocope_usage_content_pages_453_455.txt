A-péc’-o-pe is the Greek word ἁποκοπή, a cutting off, from
atrokotrTelv (apokoptein), to cut off, and this from ἁπό (apo), away
from, and кбптем (koptein), to cut. № is a figure of etymology which
relates to the spelling of words, and is used of cutting off a letter or
syllable from the end of a word. We may give it the name of END-
CUT. We have examples in such words as yon for yonder, after for
afterward.

In the Scripture we have an example in the name of Jude for
Judas.

There is no Apocope in the Greek; and therefore there is no
teaching in the use of the figure; which exists only in the translation.
Il. AFFECTING THE SENSE
Aposiopesis; or, Sudden-Silence
This is a rhetorical figure, and not a figure of grammar, but it may be
placed under the figures depending on omission, because in it
something is omitted.

Apo-si-o-pee-sis is the Greek word ἁποσιώπησις (a becoming
silent), from ἀποσιωπάω (aposi?pa?), to be silent after speaking, to
keep silence, observe a deliberate silence.

The name of this figure may be represented in English by
SUDDEN-SILENCE. The Latins named it RETICENTIA, which means
the same thing. It is the sudden breaking off of what is being said (or
written), so that the mind may be the more impressed by what is too
wonderful, or solemn, or awful for words: or when a thing may be, as
we sometimes say, “better imagined than described.”

Its use is to call our attention to what is being said, for the purpose
of impressing us with its importance.

It has been divided under four heads, according to the character of
the subject:-
