ii. An integral part of men (collectively) for the whole.

iii. А part of a thing for the whole thing.

iv. A part of a time for the whole time.

I. Synecdoché of the Genus:
Where the genus is put for the species; or universals for particulars.
i. All is put for the greater part

Exo. 9:6.-“And all the cattle of Egypt died”: i.e., all kinds of cattle, not
all the individual animals of all species. The Heb. has no article.

The kinds of cattle are particularised in verse 3. This must be so,
for no sane writer could stultify himself by meaning “all” in any other
sense, when he goes on to speak of other beasts immediately after, in
verse 10.

Exo. 9:25.-“And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt,” etc.:
ie., all parts of it, ог the greater part.

Exo. 32:3.-“And all (/е., the greater part of) the people break off the
golden earrings which were in their ears”: i.e., that part of the people
who wore them.

Verse 26: “And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together
unto him”: {.6., all who had not joined in the idolatry, for see Deu. 33:9.
There were some Levites who were not spared.

Deu. 28:64.-“And the Lord shall scatter thee among all peoples”: i.e.,
among all kinds of people, i.e., all nations.

2Sa. 16:22.-“In the sight of all Israel”: Jit, for all Israel's eyes: i.e., for
anybody to see that chose.

2Sa. 17:24.-“And Absalom ... and all the men of Israel”: i.e., the
greater part of Israel.

1Ch. 14:17.-“And the fame of David went out into all lands”: i.e., into
lands in all parts of the world.
Psa. 22:7 (8).-“All they that see me laugh me to scorn”: i.e., the great
majority; for there were many that believed.

Psa. 118:10.-“All nations compassed me about”: i.e., a great many.
Isa. 2:2.-“And all nations shall flow unto it”: {.Θ., many from all nations.
See verse 3, and Mic. 4:1.

Jer. 26:9.-“And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the
house of the Lord”: {8., a great many or most of the people. Not
everyone; as is clear from verse 16, where “the princes and all the
people” spake “unto the priests and to the prophets.” So verse 18.
Hos. 7:4.-“They are all adulterers”: i.e., most of them, or as a whole.
Hag. 2:7.-“I will shake all (i.e., people in all) nations, and the desire of
all (i.e., many in all nations) shall come.”

Mat. 3:5.-“Then went out to him Jerusalem and all (i.e., people from all
parts of) Judzea, and all the region round about Jordan.”

Mat. 8:34.-“And, behold, the whole (i.e., nearly the whole) city came
out to meet Jesus.”

Mar. 1:33.-“And all the city was gathered together at the door.” Here
“all” is put for the greater part.
Mar. 9:23.-“All things are possible to him that believeth”: {6., all things
comprehended in the promise. Not all things indiscriminately. Faith
always has respect to what is said or promised.

Joh. 1:16.-“And of his fulness have all we received”: i.e., “all” the “we”
who have received grace. The “all” is thus defined and limited.

Joh. 10:8.-“All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers”:
i.e., all who did not enter in by the door, but climbed up some other
way. See verse 1.

Other examples may be found in Mat. 10:22; Mat. 16:19; Mat.
18:18; Mat. 21:26; Mat. 24:9. Luk. 15:1. 1Co. 6:2; 1Co. 9:19; 1Co.
9:22; 1Co. 13:7. Php. 2:21; Php. 4:13. Col. 1:28. Heb. 6:16.

ii. When “all” and “every,” as universal affirmations, extend not
to all the individuals, but to all kinds; or all that are specified or
implied
Gen. 24:10.-“All the goods of his master were in his hand”: {6., all that

his master had given him. Compare verse 53.
2Ki. 8:9 --“So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present in his
hand (Metonymy for “with him”) and every good thing in Damascus”:
ie., of every kind of, or all manner of good things. Hazael did not strip
Damascus.

Joe. 2:28 (3:1).-“And it shall come to pass afterward that | will pour
out my spirit upon all flesh”: i.e., upon all kinds of people out of all
nations.

Here the figure is in the word “flesh,” and the word “all” is therefore
to be taken literally. The “all flesh” is used in distinction from “Israel”:
which before was the only People to enjoy the special gifts and calling
of God.

Zep. 2:14.-“And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
of the nations”: i.e., all manner of beasts.

Mat. 4:23.-“And healing every sickness”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “all manner of disease.”
Luk. 11:42.-“Ye tithe mint, and rue, and every herb, and pass over
judgment апа the love of God”: {6., herb of every (tithable) kind, or, as
in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “all manner of herbs.”
Joh. 1:9.-We must take this with the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] margin. “This was the true light, which lighteth every man,
coming into the world”: i.e., lighteth every man, now, without
distinction, not without exception. Hitherto only Israel had the true
light-the Shechinah or presence of Jehovah. Henceforth this
distinction was to be done away: and every man (i.e., all to whom the
Son should reveal the Father, Mat. 11:25-26) would be thus
enlightened. Every man who is enlightened, is enlightened by Christ.
Joh. 12:32.-‘l, if | be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto me”:
ie., all without distinction; clearly, not all without exception, as this
would be contrary both to fact and experience. It must, therefore, be
the figure Synecdoché; by which the genus is put for the species; and
“all? means people of all sorts and conditions and nations and
tongues, as distinguished from the one nation, Israel, which heretofore
had been partaker of the Divine favour.

Act. 10:12.-“Wherein were all the quadrupeds of the earth”: i.e., every
kind, both clean and unclean; as it goes on to describe the species, for
which the genus is thus put: viz., “wild beasts and creeping things and
fowls of the air.” The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] correctly renders it “all manner of
four-footed beasts,” etc.
1Ti. 2:4.-“Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth.”

Here the “all” is the same as in verse 1, and must mean all kinds of
men, the genus being put for the species.

In verse 2, some of them are named: and this is in
contradistinction to the former dispensation; when salvation was
confined to the Jews (Joh. 4:22); but now it is extended to people out
of all tongues, and nations, and peoples.

Heb. 2:9.-“That he by the grace of God should taste death for every
man”: i.e., all manner of men, without distinction.

It cannot mean without exception, or else every man must be
saved, and if it be taken as literally as that, then all women are
excluded, for this word all is masculine. See below under Synecdoché
of the Whole for part (Div. ΙΙΙ. sec. iv.).

Heb. 13:4.-“Marriage is honourable in all’: /е., all kinds of degrees
which the law of God allows, or all cases in which persons are entitled
to marry. Otherwise it cannot be honourable.

2Pe. 3:9.-“Not willing that any should perish.” Here, the word “willing”
is βούλομαι (boulomai), to be willing or disposed, and not θέλω
(thelq), as in 1Ti. 1:4, which means {ο purpose, determine, or design.
Hence, it means “is not disposed that any kind of person should
perish, but that all without distinction should come to repentance.”

“Whosoever” is to be taken in the same way; as meaning some out
of all: the genus being put for the species: i.e., а/ of a properly and
carefully defined class or species. That is to say, “Whosoever” fulfils
certain conditions: {6., “whosoever” believeth, “whosoever” willeth,
etc. It means all of these without exception, all these as distinct from
all the others who do not come within the specially described
characters, or correspond with the specified conditions.

It does not mean all of all kinds indiscriminately without exception,
but all without distinction.

The English word “whosoever” is not always the representative of
the same Greek word.

It is most often used to translate the relative pronoun 6c (hos), he
who, and is sometimes followed by ἄν (an), or ἑάν (ean), perchance.

When it is not this word, then it represents one of these following:-
πᾶς (pas), all, every (sometimes with ἄν or ἐάν, perchance). See
Mat. 5:22; Mat. 5:28. Luk. 6:47; Luk. 12:10; Luk. 12:48; Luk. 14:11;
Luk. 14:33; Luk. 16:18 (twice); 20:18 (first). Joh. 3:15-16; Joh. 4:13;
Joh. 8:34; Joh. 11:26; Joh. 12:46; Joh. 16:2; Joh. 19:12. Act. 10:43.
Rom. 2:1; Rom. 9:33; Rom. 10:11. 1Jn. 2:23; 1Jn. 3:4; 1Jn. 3:6
(twice), 9, 10, 15; 5:1, 18. 2Un. 1:9. Rev. 22:15.

πᾶς ὃς Gv (pas hos an), everyone who perchance. Luk. 12:8. Act.
2:21. Rom. 10:13.

ἅστις (hostis), anyone who. Mat. 5:39; Mat. 5:41; Mat. 7:24; Mat.
10:32-33; Mat. 12:50; Mat. 13:12 (twice); 18:4; 23:12. Mar. 8:34 Luk.
14:27. Gal. 5:4; Gal. 5:10. Jam. 2:10.

ὅσοι ἄν (hosoi an), as many as perchance. Luk. 9:6. Mar. 6:11.

ὅσπερ (hosper), who indeed. Mar. 15:6.

ei Tic (εἰ tis), if any. Rev. 14:11; Rev. 20:15.

ἐάν or ἄν τις (ean or an tis), if perchance any. Joh. 13:20; Joh.
20:23.
iii. A universal negative does not deny particularly
Exo. 20:10.-“The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it
thou shalt not do any work”: i.e., work that is specifically forbidden:
viz., “servile” or mechanical work (Lev. 23:7-8. Num. 28:18).
1Sa. 20:26.-“Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day”: i.e.,
concerning David or about his absence. He did speak, of course, but
not specifically about the matter referred to.
Jer. 8:6.-“No man repented him of his wickedness”: {6., scarcely any.
Mat. 5:34.-“Swear not at all’: i.e., not lightly ог thoughtlessly: the
particulars are given in verses 35 and 36.
Mat. 10:26.-“For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed”:
{8., no heavenly doctrine.
Joh. 3:32.-“And no man receiveth his testimony”: i.e., no natural man
receiveth it of himself; but only those to whom it is given of the Father.
See Mat. 11:25-26; Mat. 16:17.
Joh. 15:5.-“Without me ye can do nothing”: {6., nothing that is good
and true and right, or according to God; but a great deal that is
contrary to Him.
Joh. 18:20.-“In secret have | said nothing”: {6., nothing seditious or
criminal. In secret He had said many things, but nothing which they
particularly meant.
Act. 27:33.-‘This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
continued fasting, having taken nothing”: ᾖθ., no proper meal, or
having declined to take anything beyond proper necessaries. It is
μηδέν, not οὐδέν.
2Th. 3:11.-“For we hear that there are some which walk among you
disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.” The negative does
not deny working universally, but working of a particular kind: i.e., not
working officially, yet working officiously. This is a beautiful example of
Paregmenon (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ): “not ergazomenous, but
periergazomenous”: i.e., а5 we might put it, not busy with their bodies,
but busybodies.
1Ti. 6:3-4.-“If any man teacheth otherwise ... he is proud, knowing
nothing”: i.e., nothing about what he professes to teach, “the doctrine
which is according to godliness”: /е., the Mystery, the truth which
specially concerns the Church of God. See 3:16: “the great” Mystery
of godliness.

iv. Words denoting universality do not always affirm it of

particulars
Mar. 16:20.-“They went forth, and preached everywhere”: i.e.,
everywhere where they went; in every kind of place; or everywhere
where they were able to go.

Luk. 18:1.-“And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint”: i.e., on all occasions; or at
every opportunity, and not to grow weary.

Luk. 24:53.-“And were continually in the temple”: ᾖθ., at every
opportunity, at the proper and stated times for assembling there.
Act. 28:22.-“As concerning this sect, we know that it is everywhere
spoken against”: i.e., everywhere where it is known and spoken about
it is spoken against: as it is to this present day.
1Co. 4:17.-“As | teach everywhere in every church”: i.e., as | teach in
every place where there is an assembly, or wherever | go.
v. Words of a wider meaning are used in a narrower sense. The
universal for the particular, but of the same kind
1. Flesh is put for man or mankind
When the word “all” is used in connection with “flesh” (i.e, “all flesh”), it
is literal, and the word “flesh” is the figure (Synecdoché). The literality
of the word “all” is thus emphasized.
Gen. 6:12.-“All flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth”: {6., all
mankind.
Psa. 145:21.-“And let all flesh bless his holy name”: i.e., all men-all
mankind (Heb.: “all flesh shall bless.” See verse 10).
Isa. 40:5.-“The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh (i.e.,
all people) shall see it together.”
Isa. 66:23.-“From one sabbath to another shall all flesh (i.e., all men)
come to worship before me, saith the Lord.”
Luk. 3:6.-“And all flesh (i.e., all people) shall see the salvation of
God.”
Rom. 3:20.-“Therefore by the deeds of the law, shall no flesh be
justified in his sight.”
2. Creature is put for man

Mar. 16:15.-“Preach the gospel to every creature”: {6., to all people. A
precept fulfilled in
Col. 1:23.-“The Gospel ... which was preached to every creature
which is under heaven”: i.e., to every person without distinction.
1Pe. 2:13.-“Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man.”

The Greek is “every human creation” or creature: ἀνθρωτήνη
KTioic (anthrqpinee Ktisis): i.e., institution.

3. Domicile is put for prison
Act. 12:7.-“And a light shone in the building (οἴκημα, oikeema)”: i.e.,
the prison, a particular kind of building defined by the context. It is
called a building, for it was no longer a prison after the angel had
entered it.

4. House is put for temple
Luk. 11:51.-“From the blood of Abel ... which perished between the
altar and the House”: i.e., the temple building, as translated in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
16141
Act. 7:47.-“But Solomon built him an house”: {6., a Temple, a kind of
house.

5. Man is put for husband
Mat. 19:10.-“If the case of the man (i.e., a husband) be so with his
wife,” etc.

6. The Tongue is put for the man
As man is fallen, it generally means an evil-speaker!
Psa. 140:11 (12).-“Let not a man of tongue ({6., an evil-speaker) be
established in the earth.”
Psa. 101:5.-“Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour.”

The Heb. is “the tongue ({6., the slanderer), in the secret places of
his friend, him shall | cut off.”
Ecc. 10:11.-“Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment, and a
master of the tongue is no better”: ie., an adept in evil-speaking
(which is a particular kind of use of the tongue). See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
margin.

7. Change is put for death

Job. 14:14.-“All the days of my appointed time will | wait, till my
change come”: i.e., till | die: dying being one of many changes
experienced by man.
Pro. 31:8.-“Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all the sons
of change.” Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] renders it in the margin “sons of
destruction,” and in the Text: “such as are appointed to destruction.”
8. Quadrupeds (τετράποδα, tetrapoda) is used for tame or
domestic animals
Act. 10:12.-“Wherein were all manner (Synecdoche of Genus) of four-
footed beasts”: {6., tame or domestic animals which are classed off,
as distinct from “wild beasts” which are also “four-footed.”

9. Statute is put for allowance, or necessary food
Gen. 47:22.-“For the priests had a statute of (or from) Pharaoh, and
did eat their statute which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold
not their lands”: i.e., they ate, not the statute, but the food assigned to
them by one of the statutes which Pharaoh gave them.
Eze. 16:27.-“Behold, therefore, | have stretched out my hand over
thee and have diminished thy statute”: i.e., the food apportioned to
thee. A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] : “ordinary food.”
Pro. 30:8.-“Feed me with food of my statute”: {6., my statutory food.
See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin.
Job. 23:12.-“| have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my
appointed portion”: i.e., my ordinary allowance. The Π.Ν. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] has in the margin, literally, my own law. But
the meaning is that the Lord’s word was valued by him more than his
daily bread. The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] catches the spirit of the words and the
meaning of the figure beautifully: “my necessary food.”

10. The Bowels are put for the heart
Psa. 40:8 (9).-“Thy law is in the midst of my bowels”: i.e., “in my
heart,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] (but see the margin). Compare verse 10.

11. The Living are put for men
Gen. 3:20.-“And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was
the mother of all living”: i.e., of all living beings, or of all people who
should live hereafter.
Psa. 143:2.-“In thy sight will no living ({6., person) be justified.” The
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] inserts the word “man”: e.g., “no man living.”
12. A Common Name is sometimes put for a proper one
A name common to many is used of one par excellence: as, when
God is called “El,” “The Strong” or “the Mighty One,” it is because,
though others are strong, He is stronger than all. Gen. 14:22; Gen.
21:33. Psa. 5:4 (5); 22:1 (2), etc.

So Christ is called “the Lord.” Mat. 21:3. Joh. 11:3; Joh. 11:12, etc.
“The Teacher.” Mat. 22:24. Joh. 11:28. “The Angel.” Gen. 48:16. Exo.
23:20, or “the Angel of the Lord.” Exo. 3:2. Jdg. 6:11. So Christ is “the
seed of the woman.” Gen. 3:15. All others are seed of some woman,
but Christ is the seed.

Moses is called “the Prophet.” Hos. 12:13 (14). Deu. 34:10-12.

The Euphrates is called “the river,” because of its magnitude. Gen.
31:21. Jos. 24:2, where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] has “flood.” Psa. 72:8; Psa.
80:11 (12). Mic. 7:12.

So the Emperor Nero is called Jord. Act. 25:26.

13. The Plural Number is put for the singular
This is not Enallage; because this singular must be and is one of the
same kind. As when Sarah said: “Sarah should have given children
suck?” Here, though the plural is used, it is used of her only son: as
she goes on to say: “for | have born him a son in his old age.” Gen.
21:7.
Gen. 46:7.-“His daughters”: {6., his one daughter” Dinah.” See verses
15, 17.

Verse 23: “The sons of Dan, Hushim”: /.е., his one son.* [Note: In
these passages there is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss.,
which has the singular number.]
1Ch. 1:41.-“The sons of Anah; Dishon.”* [Note: In these passages
there is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the
singular number.]

1Ch. 2:7.-“The sons of Carmi; Achar.”* [Note: In these passages there
is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the singular
number.]

Verse 8: “The sons of Etham; Azariah.”* [Note: In these passages
there is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the
singular number.]

Verse 31: “The sons of Appaim; Ishi. And the sons of Ishi;
Sheshan. And the children of Sheshan; Ahlai.” This Ahlai was a
daughter (see verse 34)!
1Ch. 7:12.-“Hushim, the sons of Aher.”
2Ch. 24:25.-“For the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest”: i.e.,
Zechariah his son. See verses 20, 21.* [Note: In these passages there
is a reading called Sevir, and in some mss., which has the singular
number.]

Mar. 1:2. Joh. 6:45. Act. 7:42.-The word “prophets” is put for the
singular, because in only one prophet is the prophecy “written” (Mal.
3:1). But the case is different with Mat. 2:23. “That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.” A
difficulty is created by supposing that Nazarene is from netzer, a
branch (a word used of Christ only in Isaiah).

But apart from the most improbable, if not impossible etymology, it
does not say it was written. It says it was spoken; and who will deny
that many prophets may have spoken and prophesied of this Branch?
Some prophecies were written and not spoken; some were spoken
and not written; while others were both spoken and written. The same
explanation may be given of Mat. 27:9 and Act. 13:40 : where the
preposition “in” means “by.”

Il. Synecdoche of the Species
This is when the Species is put for the Genus (the opposite of the
above), or when particulars are put for universals.

i. Many is sometimes put for all
Isa. 53:12.-“And he bare the sin of many.” Yes, “many,” but for а// His
own people according to verse 6, Heb. 9:28, and Mat. 1:21.
Dan. 12:2.-“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake”: i.e., all to whom the prophecy refers. See Joh. 5:28. But
“avery man in his own order’; or rank and time and according to the
Dispensation.
Rom. 8:29.-“That he might be the first-born among many brethren”:
i.e., many relatively to others; but 8// with respect to his own brethren.
Joh. 6:50.-“This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that
anyone may eat thereof, and not die”: i.e., everyone who does eat of
it.
ii. Words of a limited and special sense are used with a wider and
more universal meaning

1. Man is used for both sexes, men and women
See Psa. 1:1; Psa. 32:1; Psa. 112:1. Jer. 17:5; Jer. 17:7, and so
frequently as not to need further citation, or to be given in full.

2. One Relationship is put for, and includes others

Psa. 22:4 (5).-“Our fathers trusted in thee”: ᾖθ., all who had lived
before them and trusted in God are included.
Psa. 106:6.-“We have sinned with our fathers”: i.e., with all who have
gone before.

2Sa. 9:7.-“And David said unto him, Fear not, for | will surely show
thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all
the land of Saul thy father”: i.e., thy grandfather.

2Sa. 19:28.-Mephibosheth said to David, “All of my father’s house
were but dead men before my lord the king”: he means his father’s
father.
Dan. 5:2; Dan. 5:11.-In verse 18 Daniel, speaking to Belshazzar, calls
Nebuchadnezzar (by Synecdoché) his father, whereas he was his
grandfather. See the margin of verse 2, 11. Daniel made no mistake,
but he makes use of a common and well known figure of speech.
1Ki. 15:10; 1Ki. 15:13.-Asa’s grandmother is called his “mother.” See
margin of verse 10.
Jdg. 9:1.-“Brethren’ is put for other relations. So also
Gen. 13:8; Gen. 31:23; 1Ch. 12:29, where it is rendered “kindred.”
See margin.
Jerome classifies four kinds of “brethren”:-“brethren” by

1. Nature. Gen. 27:1.

2. Nation. Deu. 15:3.

3. Kindred. Gen. 13:8.

4. Affection. Psa. 133:1, etc., etc.
Exo. 1:7.-“Sons” are put for posterity. So also Jer. 31:29.
Gen. 29:5.-Laban the “son” of Nahor is put for his grandson.
Gen. 24:48.-Rebecca called Abraham's “brother’s daughter,” when
she was the daughter of Bethuel and granddaughter of Nahor, not of
Abraham.
2Sa. 19:24.-Mephibosheth is called “the son of Saul.” “Son” is here
put (by Synecdoché) for his grandson.
Jos. 7:24.-Achan is called “the son of Zerah,” which is put for great
grandson. See verse 1. So
Mat. 1:1.-Christ is called “the Son of David” in a like way. The word
“son” being used in a wide signification. So Mat. 9:27; Mat. 12:23; Mat.
15:22; Mat. 20:30-31; Mat. 21:9; Mat. 21:15; Mat. 22:42. Mar. 12:35.
Luk. 18:38-39. Compare Rom. 1:3. 2Ti. 2:8. Rev. 22:16.

Hence David is called his father (Luk. 1:32).

Zacchzeus is in the same way called a “son of Abraham” (Luk.
19:9). Compare Luk. 13:16.

All the Jews called Abraham their “father” (Luk. 1:73. Joh. 8:39,
see verse 56. Act. 7:2. Rom. 4:1).

The Samaritans called Jacob their “father” (Joh. 4:12).

iii. A proper name is put for a common; an individual is put for many;
and the particular is put for the universal

Isa. 63:16.-“Thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,
and Israel acknowledge us not.”

Here, the individuals are put for the great majority of the People of
Israel. For the patriarchs named were long since dead.
1Co. 3:6.-“Apollos” is put for any minister.
1Со. 7:16.-“Wife” and “man” are put for all wives and all husbands.

iv. A species of a thing is put for the whole genus
1. Bow, Spear, etc., are put for all kinds of arms

Psa. 44:6 (7).-“I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
me”: i.e., | will not trust in any weapons or in any human means of
defence, but in God alone, see verse 7 (8). This may be also
Metonymy of the adjunct. So Zec. 10:4.
Psa. 46:9 (10).-“He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth:
he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
chariot in the fire”: i.e., if all wars are to cease, all kinds of implements
of war must be included and represented in the few species named.
2. The Ass is put for all kinds of animals not sacrificed
Exo. 13:13.-“And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a
lamb.” The firstborn of all unclean beasts, which might not be
sacrificed, had to be redeemed (see Num. 18:15), but only one
species is named here, and in 34:20.
3. Gold is put for gifts
Psa. 72:15.-“To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.” Here, the
principal gift is put for all other kinds of gifts. See Isa. 60:5-7.
4. Stones are put for whatever is hurtful to the soil
Job. 5:23.-“For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.”
5. Lion is put for all kinds of wild beasts
Isa. 15:9.-“I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth
of Moab.”
6. Commandment is put for all commandments and doctrines
2Pe. 2:21.-“It had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after they had known it, to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them.” So chap. 3:2.
7. Honey is put for whatever is sweet and delicious
Exo. 3:8; Exo. 3:17.-“A land flowing with milk and honey”: i.e., filled
with all satisfying and delightful things, sweet and good: i.e., a region
irrigated and fruitful, abounding with pasture and fruits of all kinds. See
Exo. 13:5; Exo. 33:3. Lev. 20:24. Num. 13:27; Num. 14:8; Num. 16:13.
Deu. 6:3; Deu. 11:9; Deu. 26:9; Deu. 26:15; Deu. 27:3; Deu. 31:20.
Jos. 5:6. Jer. 11:5; Jer. 32:22. Eze. 20:6; Eze. 20:15.
Sometimes “oil” is added, or “figs,” etc. Deu. 8:8; Deu. 32:13. 2Ki.
18:32. Eze. 16:13; Eze. 16:19.
Sometimes “butter.” Job. 20:17.
8. Bread is put for all kinds of food, including fish
It is often translated “food.” Gen. 3:19; Gen. 18:5; Gen. 39:6; Gen.
43:25; Gen. 43:31; Gen. 49:20. Lev. 3:11 (food); 21:6, * [Note: “Bread
of thy God”: i.e., food which God gives.] 8.* [Note: “Bread of thy God”:
1.8., food which God gives.] Num. 28:2. Jdg. 13:16. 1Sa. 14:24 (food);
20:27 (meat); 28:20. Job. 6:7 (meat); 20:14 (meat); Psa. 41:9 (10):
102:4 (5); 136:25; 146:7. Ecc. 9:11; Ecc. 10:19 (feast). Isa. 3:1; Isa.
58:7. Jer. 52:33; Dan. 5:1 (feast). Hos. 9:4. Mal. 1:7. Mat. 6:11; Mat.
15:2; Mat. 15:26. Luk. 14:1 : etc., etc.

Hence to “break bread” or to “eat bread” means to partake of a
meal. It is the common Hebrew idiom to this day. Just as among the
Arabs, “salt” (one particular and important kind of food) is put
universally for the whole meal and for all kinds of food, and “to take
salt” with anyone means to partake of his hospitality. So “to break
bread” means not to partake of the Lord’s supper, but to partake of an
ordinary meal with others. By Synecdoche “bread” (one kind of food)
is put for all kinds of food (or meat), and the breaking of it is merely
equivalent to carving or cutting it up. See under /diom.

When “water” is added ({6., “bread and water’), it is meant to
include all kinds of solid and liquid food necessary to eat and to drink.
See Isa. 3:1; Isa. 33:16, etc.

9. Peace is used for plenty, and happiness; and of all kinds of
earthly good and blessing
Gen. 43:23.-“Peace be to you”: i.e., peace and all blessings.
Num. 6:26.-“The Lord ... give thee peace.”
Psa. 119:165.-“Great peace (i.e., every blessing) have they which love
thy law.”
Rom. 2:10.-“But glory, honour, and peace (i.e., every earthly blessing)
to every man that worketh good,” etc. See this passage under the
figure of Ellipsis. So also Jam. 3:18.

Peace is also used of all heavenly and spiritual blessing
Isa. 57:19.-“I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to him that is far
off,” etc. See under Epizeuxis.
Joh. 14:27.-“Peace | leave with you, my peace | give unto you”: i.e.,
not peace alone, which is only one species of heavenly gifts, but all
kinds of blessings. So Joh. 20:19; Joh. 20:21; Joh. 20:26.
Rom. 1:7.-“Grace to you, and peace.”
Rom. 5:1.-“Therefore having been justified by faith (ἐκ πίστεως, ek
ρἰδίεφς, on faith-principle, as opposed to /aw-principle) we have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ’; and with it every
heavenly blessing, as verse 2 goes on to show: “By whom we have
obtained access also by faith into this grace wherein we stand.” So
also Rom. 14:17, etc., etc.
10. Prey (C/O, that which is taken in hunting: .e., one kind of
food) is put for any and all kinds of food
Psa. 111:5.-“He hath given prey (so margin: i.e., meat) unto them that
fear him”: i.e., those who fear God will not have to hunt in vain for their
food! He will give it to them. See Psa. 147:9.
Pro. 31:15.-“She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth prey to her
household”: {6., finds and prepares their food.
Mal. 3:10.-“Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may
be prey in mine house.”

11. Blood (Heb. often Bloods) is put for murder or cruelty; or

death generally

Deu. 19:12.-“The avenger of blood”: i.e., murder.
Psa. 9:12 (13).-“When He maketh inquisition for blood”: i.e. for the
shedding of blood.

So Hos. 1:4; Hos. 4:2. Mat. 23:35; Mat. 27:24.

12. Blood is also put for guilt

Lev. 20:9.-“His blood shall be upon him”: i.e., his guilt or punishment,
etc., etc.
Deu. 19:10.-“And so blood (i.e., guilt) be not upon him.”
Deu. 21:8.-“And the blood (i.e., the guilt) shall be forgiven them.” So in
the next verse the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] actually supplies the words: “So shalt thou
put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you.”
2Ki. 24:4.-“He filled Jerusalem with innocent blood.” “Blood” (i.e.,
murder and the guilt of it) is here put as the gravest sin, for all the
other kinds of sins which Jehoiakim committed in Jerusalem.
Psa. 51:14 (16).-“Deliver me from bloods, О God”: ᾖ8., (as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] ), “from blood-guiltiness.”
Isa. 1:15.-“Your hands are full of blood”: i.e., of murders and blood-
guiltiness.

13. Clothing is put for all necessary things
Isa. 3:6.-“When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of
his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler”: i.e., thou art
well dressed and therefore hast other good things beside.
14. Widows and Fatherless are put for all kinds of afflicted
Exo. 22:21.-“Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.” Surely
it does not follow that they might afflict all others. No! one kind or class
is put for all similar kinds of helpless people.

Deu. 10:18.-“He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and
widow.”

Deu. 27:19.-“Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the
stranger, fatherless, and widow.” So also Psa. 146:9. Pro. 23:10. Isa.
1:17; Isa. 1:23. Jer. 7:6; Jer. 22:3. Eze. 22:7.

Jam. 1:27.-“pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,” etc.: i.e., all in
distress or trouble of any kind. This refers to “religion” which in itself is
nothing. All who are “in Christ” will surely manifest such evidence as
this and much more. But for those not “in Christ,” all the visiting of all
the widows and fatherless in the world will never accomplish the
stupendous miracle of Divine grace; for we are saved by grace and
not by works.
v. Verbs having a special meaning are used in a more general
sense

1. “To Ascend” is used for to come, or to enter into the thoughts,
or the mind

2Ki. 12:4.-“All the money that ascendeth upon the heart of a man”:

ie., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] , “that cometh into any man’s heart” ({6.,

thoughts, his thoughts or mind).

Jer. 7:31.-“To burn their sons and daughters in the fire; which |

commanded them not, neither did it ascend upon my heart”: i.e., come

into my mind.

Eze. 38:10.-“At the same time shall things ascend upon thine heart”:

ie., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] , come into thy mind.
1Co. 2:9.-“Neither have ascended upon the heart of man”: i.e., as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “Neither have entered into the heart of man.” Here the
idiom is Hebrew, though the language is Greek.

2. To Make (with time) is used for to continue or abide
Act. 15:33.-“And, having made a time, they were let go”: i.e., as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “After they had tarried there a space.”
Act. 18:23.-“And having made or done some time, he departed”: {6.,
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , “After he had spent some time there.”
Act. 20:3.-“And having done three months there”: {6., as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
“And there abode three months.”
2Co. 11:25.-“A night and a day have | done or made in the deep”: {6.,
| have passed or been in the deep.
Jam. 4:13.-“Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we shall go
into such a city, and shall do a year there”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
continue there a year.

So Latin agere vitam (to live), and agere poenitentiam (to repent)
which Rome, translating literally in all her versions, renders “do
penance.”

3. To go out and come in is used of official actions or of life in
general
Num. 27:16-17.-“... set a man over the congregation, Which may go
out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may
lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of
the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.”

So verse 21. 2Ch. 1:10. Psa. 121:8. Isa. 37:28. Joh. 10:9. Act.

1:21.
4. To find is used for to receive, to obtain
Gen. 6:8.-“Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord”: i.e., received
grace from the Lord.
Gen. 26:12.-“Then Isaac sowed in that land, and found (i.e., received,

as A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English

Bible, 1611.] , see margin) in the same year an hundredfold: and the

Lord blessed him.”

Luk. 1:30.-“Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with (ie.,

received grace from) God.”

Rom. 4:1.-“What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as

pertaining to the flesh, hath found?” {6., received or obtained.

Heb. 9:12.-“By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,

having found (i.e., obtained, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version,

or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) eternal redemption for us.”
5. To find is also used of to have, or to be present with

1Sa. 13:15.-“And Saul numbered the people that were found (i.e.,

were present) with him, about six hundred men.”

Luk. 9:36.-“And when the voice was past Jesus was found (i.e., was

present) alone.”

Rom. 7:18.-“For | know that in me (that is, in my flesh) there does not

dwell any good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform
that which is good | find not (i.e., is not present with me).”
Php. 2:8.-“And being found (i.e., present) in fashion as a man he
humbled himself.”
Php. 3:9.-“And be found (i.e., be present) in him.”
Heb. 11:5.-“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see
death; and was not found (i.e., present), because God had translated
him.”

6. To call upon the Lord is used of Divine worship
A special act is put for the general act of worship.
Gen. 4:26.-“Then began men to call upon (i.e., to worship) the name
of the Lord”: i.e., Jehovah. See under Metonymy.
Isa. 43:22.-“But thou hast not called upon me ({6., worshipped me), ©
Jacob.”
So the Greek προσκυνέω (proskuneq), to do homage by kissing
the hand, the general word for reverence is put for the special act of
worship.

Joh. 4:23-24.-“The hour is coming and now is, when the true
worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit; and they that worship
him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” See also under Hendiadys
below.

7. To Pass the Night is used for abiding
Psa. 49:12.-“Man being in honour, abideth not: he is like the beasts
that perish.”
Isa. 1:21.-“Righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.”

8. To Place is put for to make

Rom. 4:17.-“I have placed thee (i.e., made thee) a father of many
nations.”
Heb. 1:2.-“Whom he hath placed (i.e., appointed) heir of all things.”
9. To Meet (καταντάω, katantaq) is used of arriving at so as to
touch

Act. 16:1.-“Then came he to (/е., and he arrived at) Derbe and
Lystra,” etc.
Eph. 4:13.-‘Till we shall all have come into ({6., arrived at) the unity of
the faith,” etc.
Php. 3:11.-“If by any means | might attain unto (i.e., arrive at) the out-
rising, that one from among the dead.”* [Note:“ucticlms о αἡ &
Βραιιῶ «i ἓ ἠσῶ. LTTr.WH. and R.V. read с & for αῶ, as rendered
above.] Paul is saying this from his point of view as a Jew, and not
that of a saint. He is speaking of what he formerly counted as his
gains (verse 7), and which he now “counted loss for the knowledge of
Christ ... that | may be found in him ... that | may know him ... if by
any means | might arrive at the out-rising from among the dead.”

This was not spoken as a Christian, as though he might attain
something that other Christians could not attain; but it was spoken as
a Jew, that he might attain (in Christ) a resurrection from among the
dead, which other Jews could not hope for. The Jews looked for a
resurrection, but it was only τῶν νεκρῶν (fqn nekropn), of dead
persons, while Paul was willing to give up this and all his other
supposed “gains” for the blessed hope of an out-rising, ἐκ τῶν νεκρων.
(ek фп nekropn), from among the dead.
1Th. 4:17.-“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught away
together with them in clouds for a meeting of the Lord, into the air, and
thus, always with the Lord shall we be.”

Here, the meeting involves actual arrival at the meeting-place of
the Lord, and actual presence there with him.

10. To Drink is used of partaking of food and drink of all kinds
1Co. 3:2.-“I gave you milk to drink and not meat”: {6., as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , 1
have fed you. See under Zeugma.

11. To Answer, or Open the Mouth is put for speaking
Job. 3:1.-“After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day”: i.e.,
Job said, etc.
Psa. 119:172.-“My tongue shall respond to thy word”: {6., speak of it,
as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.]
And so, very frequently, this Hebrew idiom is used in the New
Testament.
Mat. 11:25.-“At that time Jesus answered ({6., spake), and said: |
thank Thee Father, ... Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
sight.” Thus our attention is called to what He said; for the answer was
to the circumstances of “that time.” What were they? John had
questioned (verses 2-6). The people had spurned both John and
Himself (16-19). His mighty works had been fruitless (20-24). And,
then, “at that time,” when all seemed to end in failure, the Lord Jesus
found rest in submission and resignation to the Father’s will, and,
then, turning to all His servants-“weary and heavy laden” with their
burden and toil-He graciously invites them to find rest where He had
found it, saying: “Come unto me ... and | will give you rest. Take my
yoke upon you, and learn of me; ... and ye shall find rest.”

Mar. 11:14.-“And Jesus answered and said unto it” (the fig-tree, which
had not spoken), i.e., spake and said.

So Luk. 7:40, etc.

12. To Sit is used of a permanent condition in which one is placed
Isa. 42:7.-“Them that sit in darkness,” quoted in Mat. 4:16.

Act. 18:11.-“And he sat there a year and six months teaching the word
of God among them”: i.e., he continued there, but the verb “sat” is
used in order to be in harmony with his act of teaching. See under
Metonymy.

13. To Sit Down and Rise Up is used for all the ordinary acts of

life which come between them
Psa. 139:2.-“Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising.”
14. To Come, ат (bq), ἔρχεσθαι (erchesthai), is used of going as
well as coming

Jon. 1:3.-“But Jonah ... found a ship coming ({6., going) to Tarshish.”
Mar. 16:2.-“They came (i.e., went) unto the sepulchre.”
Joh. 6:17.-“And (they) entered into a ship, and came ({6., went) over
the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not
come ({6., gone) to them.
Joh. 11:29.-“As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came
(i.e., went) unto him.”
Act. 28:17.-“And so we came (i.e., went, as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] )
towards Rome.”

Rev. 6:1; Rev. 6:3; Rev. 6:5; Rev. 6:7.-In these verses, the verb “and

see” goes out, according to the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,

1881.] and all the Critical Texts. In this case the verb “come” is used

in the sense of “go,” as a command from the throne to the horsemen,

e.g., “| heard as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living

creatures, saying, Go! and | saw and behold a white horse ... and he

went forth.” So in each of the other cases.

vi. One example or specimen is put for all kinds of similar things
1. In human actions

Deu. 19:5.-One kind of homicide is mentioned as an example of every

kind.

Psa. 112:5.-“Lending” is put as one kind of favour which a good man

sheweth. The most rare is given as an example of all kinds of merciful

works.

Pro. 20:10.-“Divers ephahs” are put for all kinds of measures.

Pro. 27:14.-“Blessing” a friend with a loud voice, is put for all kinds of

flattery.
Jer. 15:10.-“Lending on usury” is put for all kinds of business
transactions and contracts which are liable to gender strife.

Zec. 5:3.-“Stealing” and “swearing’-two of the commonest kinds of
sin-are put for other kinds.

Mat. 5:22.-“Raca’ is put for all kinds of opprobrious terms, etc.

Mat. 6:1.-“Take heed that ye do not your righteousness.”

The figure here led to an early corruption of the text. One kind of
righteous acts, alms-giving, is put for all kinds. Hence ἐλεημοσύνην
(eléeemosuneen), alms, was put for δικαιοσύνην (dikaiosuneen),
righteousness.
Mat. 6:5.-Ргауег is only one of many things which are not to be done
as the hypocrites do them.
Mat. 6:16.-So with fasting.
Mar. 11:23.-Removing mountains-one kind of impossible thing, is put
for all kinds that are “impossible with men.” So Luk. 17:6. Mat. 17:20 :
in which latter place the word “nothing” shows that removing
mountains is only one of a class of impossibilities. It is not in the
nature of things for a word to pluck up a mountain. See 1Co. 13:2.
Job. 9:5.-“Which removeth mountains, and they know not.” This is
only one kind of things which are possible with God, though
impossible with men (Luk. 18:27).
Heb. 13:9.-“It is a good thing that the heart to be established with
grace, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been
occupied therein.” Here “meats,” one of the things about which people
are occupied, is put for all kinds of divers and strange doctrines which
do not profit those who are occupied with them.

2. In Divine Precepts, etc.
Exo. 20:12.-“Honour thy father and thy mother’: i.e., all who stand in
the place of parents.
Exo. 23:4.-The “ox and ass” are mentioned only as examples, for
surely a horse, or camel, or child, etc., would be included in the
command.
Pro. 25:21. Rom. 12:20.-Surely the two things mentioned are only
examples of many ways in which love may be shown to our enemies.
Luk. 3:11.-One kind of vestment is put for any kind.
1Ti. 6:8.-“Food and raiment” are put by example for this world’s
goods. See 1.)п. 3:17.
Joh. 13:14.-“Washing the feet” is only one kind or one example of
humble service which one may do for another. So 1Sa. 25:41. 1Ti.
5:10.

Ill. Synecdoche of the Whole
Synecdoche of the whole is when the whole is put for a part. This is a
closer connection than that of mere genus or species. It is when the
one is not merely of the same kind as the other, but actually a part or
member of it.
i. The whole is put for every part of it
Num. 16:3.-“Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation
are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them”: i.e., the
whole congregation having been separated to the Lord from the other
nations, each person was also included.
1К!. 6:22.-“The whole house he overlaid with gold”: and therefore
every part of it.
Mat. 3:5.-“Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all (πᾶσα, pasa)
Judzea, and all the region round about Jordan:” the words Jerusalem,
Judaea, and region, being used by Synecdoché of the genus for the
people in them. The word “all” is literal, and means the whole as
including every part. So that “all Judaza” means people from every
part of Judzea. So Mar. 1:5. Act. 1:8.
Mat. 27:45.-“There was darkness over all the land (ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,
epi pasan teen geen)”: i.e., the whole Land, as in Mar. 15:33 (ὅλην,
holeen).
Eph. 2:21.-“In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth
unto an holy temple in the Lord”: i.e., the whole building; πᾶσα (pasa),
every being put for every part of it.
Eph. 3:15.-“Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.”
Here, the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] has rendered the
figure literally “every family,” which is not sense, but in the margin has
put “Gr. fatherhood.” “Every” here is used for “the whole,” and means
every part or member of the whole: i.e., the whole family as made up
of every principality, and power, and angel, and archangel “in heaven”
(verse 10), and of Israel and the Church on earth. All are of or from
one Creator and Source (Heb. 2:11). See Ellipsis.
Col. 2:9.-“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily”:
lit, every: i.e., every part of, meaning the whole fulness of the
Godhead in bodily form.

2Ti. 3:16.-“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God”: {6., the whole
Scripture; not “every Scripture,” as in the R.V. [Note: The Revised
Version, 1881.] , but every part of Scripture. See under Ellipsis, page
44.

Act. 4:10.-“Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel”: {6.,
the whole of Israel.

Rom. 4:16.-“To the end the promise might be sure to all the seed”:
ie., the whole seed.

2Th. 1:10.-“When He shall have come (ἔλθῃ, e/thee) to be glorified in
his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe ... in that day”:
i.e., the whole body of believers.

In like manner “every” (i.e., “all”) is used for the whole in Mat.
26:59. Mar. 1:33; Mar. 14:55. Act. 2:47; Act. 7:10; Act. 15:22. Php.
1:13.

ii. The Collective is put for the particular
What is said of the whole, collectively, is sometimes said (by
Synecdoche) only of a part; and not of all the parts, precisely and
singularly.

Gen. 6:12.-“All flesh.” This did not include Noah. See verse 9.

Gen. 35:26.-“These are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in
Padan-Aram.” This does not include Benjamin. See verses 24 and 16.
Mat. 19:28.-“Ye which have followed me ... when the Son of man shall
sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” The “ye” does not include Judas
Iscariot.

Heb. 11:13.-“These all died in faith.” This does not include Enoch (see
verse 5), but only all who died.

1Co. 15:22.-“For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be
made alive.” But all will not die (see verse 51). Those who are “alive
and remain” to the coming of the Lord will not die at all, but be
changed. Therefore it means-that, as, in Adam, all who are in him die,
so in Christ also, all who are in Him shall be made alive. The “all” in
the first clause clearly does not include the all who shall be “alive and
remain,” and cannot therefore include the “all” in the second clause.
iii. The whole is put for one of its parts
Gen. 8:13.-“And Noah removed the covering of the ark,” i.e., not the
whole roof, but the covering of the aperture which was made in it as a
part of it: see 6:16.
Exo. 22:13.-‘If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it (i.e., one of the
pieces) for witness.”
1Sa. 5:4.-“And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold,
Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
Lord; and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were
cut off upon the threshold: only Dagon was left to him, i.e., only the
body was left. So the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] puts in italics “only the stump of
Dagon was left.”
Psa. 102:5 (6).-“My bones cleave to my flesh,” i.e., “my skin,” as in
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] , see margin.
1Sa. 19:24.-“Naked” for scantily clad. So also Isa. 20:2-3. Mic. 1:8.
Joh. 21:7. Job. 22:6; Job. 24:10. Mat. 25:36; Mat. 25:43. Jam. 2:15.
10ο. 4:11. In all these cases “naked” is put for being scantily clothed,
or poorly clad.
Act. 27:33.-“And continued fasting.” Fasting, the whole, is put for the
part; i.e., from real nourishment, or regular meals.
iv. A place is put for a part of it
1. The World is put for persons in all parts of it
Joh. 3:16.-“God so loved the world”: ᾖθ., people and kindred and
tongues in all parts of the world. Not, as heretofore, only Israel. This
love was confined to Israel, according to Deu. 33:3 : “Yea, he loved
the people”: i.e., Israel (chap. 7:6-8, etc.). But now His love was to go
out beyond Israel to people of all nations of the world, without any
such distinction. It is not the world without exception, but without
distinction.
Joh. 12:19.-“Behold, the world is gone after him”: i.e., multitudes of
people of all sorts. Synecdoche here is preferable to Hyperbole (q.v.
[Note: Which 5εε.]).
Rom. 1:8.-“Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world”: i.e., in
all parts of the world.
1Jn. 2:2.-“Not for ours only, but also for the whole world”: i.e., for all
people; without distinction. See Metonymy of the Subject.

2. “The World” is put for a primary part of it
Isa. 13:11.-“And | will punish the world for their evil”: i.e., Babylon (see
verse 1). So Isa. 14:17.
Luk. 2:1.-“There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the
world (i.e., the civilised world, or Roman Empire) should be taxed.”

3. All the Earth is put for the greater part of its inhabitants
Gen. 41:57.-“In all lands”: i.e., in many neighbouring countries.
2Sa. 15:23.-“All the country”: i.e., all the country round him.
Isa. 13:5.-“The whole land”: i.e., all the land of Chaldeea.

4. The Earth is put for the land of Judcea
Hos. 1:2.-Rendered “land.” Hos. 4:1. Joe. 1:2, etc.
5. The Land (γῆ) is put for city
Mat. 2:6.-“And thou, Bethlehem, land (i.e., city) of Juda.” Not seeing
the figure, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] interpolates the word “in” in italics.
6. The East is put for Persia, Media, and other countries east of
Jerusalem
Eze. 25:4. 1Ki. 4:30. Isa. 2:6. Mat. 2:1, etc.
7. The South is put for Egypt, with respect to Palestine
Jer. 13:19. Dan. 11:5, etc.
8. The South is put for the Negev, or the hill country of Judea,
with respect to Jerusalem
Gen. 12:9; Gen. 13:1; Gen. 13:3. Eze. 20:46-47.
9. The North is put for Chaldoea and its chief city Babylon,
because all armies from beyond the Euphrates crossed high up
and entered Palestine from the North
Jer. 1:13-15; Jer. 13:20; Jer. 47:2. Zep. 2:13.
10. The North is put for Media and Persia, with respect to
Babylon
Jer. 6:1 (compare 51:11 and 27, 28); 50:3, 41.
11. The Temple is put for certain of the parts comprehended in it
Luk. 2:46. Joh. 18:20.
v. Time is put for a portion of time

énéi (ohlam), for ever, used in various limited significations.

Exo. 21:6.-“And he shall serve him for ever”: i.e., as long as he lives.
So Deu. 15:17, and Philem. 15.

Lev. 25:46.-“They shall be your bondmen for ever”: {6., as long as
they live.

1Sa. 1:22.-“That he (Samuel) may appear before the Lord, and there
abide for ever”: {6., as long as he lives.

1Ch. 15:2.-“For them (the Levites) hath the Lord chosen to carry the
ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever’: i.e., without change.
2Sa. 12:10.-“Now therefore the sword shall never (it, not for ever)
depart from thine house”: i.e., while David or his family lived.
Jer. 5:15.-The Babylonians are called “a nation from eternity”: i.e.,
very ancient (compare Gen. 10:10).
Jer. 17:4.-“Ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for
ever”: {68., until all is consumed.
Jer. 25:9.-“Eternal desolations.” Here it is rendered “perpetual” to
soften it down, as the period is distinctly defined in verse 11 to be
“seventy years.” After which Babylon is to become eternal desolation
(verse 12), until it shall be rebuilt according to many prophecies.
Verses 9 and 12 clearly mean, therefore, that the desolations shall be
complete and continuous during the whole period referred to.
Dan. 2:4; Dan. 6:21 (22), etc.-“O King, live for ever”: i.e., a long time:
as we say, “Long live the king.”

So in Luk. 20:9, “a long (a sufficient) time” (χρόνος, chronos): i.e.,
a year; till the next season.

IV. Synecdoche of the Part

Synecdoche of the Part is when a part is put for the whole. The
connection between the part and the whole is closer also than that
between the species and the genus; inasmuch as the part is actually a
member of the whole, and not merely a species or specimen of it.

In Synecdoche of the Part, one part or member is put for, and
includes, every part or member.
i. An integral part of man (individually) is put for the whole man
1. The Soul (dou, nephesh, and ψυχή, psychee) is put for the
whole person
Gen. 12:5.-“The souls ({6., the persons) that they had gotten in

Haran.”

Gen. 14:21.-“And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the
souls ({6., the persons) and take the goods to thyself.”

Gen. 17:14.-“That soul (i.e., that person) shall be cut off from his
people.”

So Gen. 46:15; Gen. 46:26-27. Exo. 12:19; Exo. 16:16 (marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] ) Lev. 5:2; Lev. 5:4. Jos. 20:3. Eze. 18:4; Eze.
18:20. Act. 2:41; Act. 2:43; Act. 7:14. Rom. 13:1. 1Pe. 3:20. Luk. 6:9,
“to save a soul”: {6., a man.

In this sense we must take Rev. 6:9; Rev. 20:4 : “the souls of them
that were slain or beheaded”: i.e., the persons. John saw the dead
persons. They could not reign till they were made alive, hence in 20:4,
we read that “they lived.” Moreover, how could “souls” cry “How long?”
or, as such, wear “white robes,” which “were given unto every one of
them” (6:11)?
2. The expression My Soul, His Soul, etc., becomes by Synecdoché
the idiom for me, myself, himself, etc. See under Idiom.

Num. 23:10.-“Let my soul die the death of the righteous”: i.e., let me
die, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] See the margin.
Jdg. 16:30.-“And Samson said, Let my soul (/е., me, as in A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
see margin) die with the Philistines.”
Job. 36:14.-“Their soul dieth (i.e., they die, as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) in
youth.”
Psa. 3:2 (3).-“Many there be which say of my soul (i.e., of me), There
is no help for him in his God.” So Psa. 11:1.
Psa. 16:10.-“Thou wilt not leave my soul (i.e., me) in Hades”: i.e., the
grave.
Psa. 25:13.-“His soul (i.e., he) shall dwell at ease.”
Psa. 35:13.-“I humbled my soul (i.e., myself) with fasting.”
Psa. 103:1.-“Bless the Lord, О my soul”: {6., О myself. So in verses 2,
22, and Psa. 104:1; Psa. 104:35.
Isa. 57:5.-“Is it such a fast that | have chosen? a day for a man to
afflict his soul?” /.e., himself.

Luk. 12:19.-“I will say to my soul”: i.e., myself, etc.

Act. 2:31.-“His soul ({6., He) was not left in Hades (the grave), neither
his flesh did see corruption.”

Rom. 16:4.-“Who have for my soul (A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , life) laid down
their own necks”: {6., who have laid down their own necks for me.
1Pe. 1:9.-“Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
souls”: i.e., of yourselves.

3. Soul (dou, nephesh) is also used of animals;
and when joined with the word “living” (khayah), means “living
creature,” as translated in Gen. 1:20-21; Gen. 1:24; Gen. 1:30. So
also Rev. 16:3, as well as of man in Gen. 2:7, where it is rendered
“living soul.”

4. The Body is put for the person himself

Just as we say, “a hand” for a workman.
Exo. 21:3.-‘If he (i.e., the Hebrew servant) came in with his body (i.e.,
by himself, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] )”: /е., alone, without a wife, as the rest of
the verse explains it.
Rom. 12:1.-“I beseech you therefore ... that ye present your bodies
(i.e., yourselves) a living sacrifice,” etc.
1Co. 6:15.-“Know ye not that your bodies (i.e., ye) are the members of
Christ?”
Jam. 3:6.-“So is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the
whole body”: i.e., the whole being.

5. The Flesh, an integral part of man, is put for the whole
Gen. 17:13.-“My covenant shall be in your flesh”: i.e., in your body, on
your person.

Psa. 16:9.-“My flesh also shall rest in hope”: i.e., my body will rest in
hope. See Act. 2:26-31.
Pro. 14:30.-“A sound heart is the life of the flesh”: {6., of the body.
2Co. 7:1.-“Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh ({6.,
of the body) and spirit.”

6. The Flesh is put for the whole person
Gen. 6:12.-“All flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” Here
“flesh,” being the figure for people, the word “all” is literal: {6., all
people, every person. But even this excepts Noah. See above.
Psa. 56:4 (5).-“I will not fear what flesh (i.e., man) can do unto me.”
See verse 11 (12).

Psa. 65:2 (3)-“O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh
come”: i.e., all people.

Psa. 145:21.-“Let all flesh ({6., let all people) bless his holy name for
ever’: /it., “all flesh shall bless,” as in verse 10.

Isa. 40:5.-“The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh (i.e.,
all people) shall see it together.” See Luk. 3:6.

Isa. 40:6.-“All flesh is grass.” See Metaphor.

Mat. 19:5.-“And they twain shall be one flesh”: {6., one person, not a
soulless body!

Joh. 6:51.-“My flesh”: i.e., myself.

Rom. 3:20.-“By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh (i.e., not a
single person) be justified.” Here, the “flesh” being figurative, the
negative denies literally. So

1Со. 1:29.-“That no flesh (i.e., not a single person) should glory in his
presence.”

1Pe. 1:24.-“All flesh (/.€., every one) is as grass.”
7. Flesh is put for the whole, and true, humanity of Christ
Joh. 1:14.-“The Word was made flesh”: {6., man, a human being.
Joh. 6:51-56.-Here, “flesh” and “blood,” (see below) are jointly as well
as severally put for humanity as distinct from Divinity. There are other
figures in this passage; but the word “flesh” is put, not for the “body” of
Christ, but for Himself in His true humanity.
1Ti. 3:16.-“Manifest in the flesh”: {6., in human beings. The “mystery”
was manifest. The reading 6 (ho), which, corresponds best with the
context, and agrees with the neuter word Мистйрюм, mystery. This
mystery is Christ Mystical (not personal): i.e., Christ the head of the
Body in glory and His members here upon earth. Otherwise the last
three facts at the end of the verse are quite out of order. They
describe the order as to Christ Mystical, but not as to Christ personal.*
[Note: See The Mystery, by the same author and publisher.]
1Pe. 3:18.-“Being put to death as to the flesh (i.e., as to his human
nature), but quickened (i.e., raised from the dead) as to his spirit ({6.,
his resurrection or spiritual body).” There is no article with either word:
only the dative case, describing what happened as to the body. This is
the usage of the words “flesh” and “spirit” in 10ο. 15:1-58t [Note: See
The Spirits in Prison, by the same author and publisher.] See also
chap. 4:1.
Heb. 10:20.-“By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated
(marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] , new made) for us, through the veil, that is
to say, his flesh”: i.e., his human nature, Himself as truly and really
man.
1Jn. 4:2.-“Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh ({6., in His real human nature) is of God.” Note the three forms
of the verb ἔρχομαι. Here, it is the perfect participle, ἐληλυθότα
(eleeluthota), “being come.” In chap. 5:6, it is the aorist participle, ὁ
ἐλθὼν (ho elthqpn), “this is He that came.” While in 2Jn. 1:7, it is the
present participle, ἐρχόμενον (erchomenon), “who confess not that
Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh”: i.e., in his human nature, the
same Jesus, in like manner as he went into heaven (Act. 1:11).

8. Flesh is put for all living beings
Gen. 6:13.-“The end of all flesh is come before me “: i.e., the end of
every living creature. Here, the “all” is literal, because “flesh” is
figurative.
Gen. 6:17.-“I ... bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all
flesh”: {6., every living thing.
Psa. 136:25.-“Who giveth food to all flesh”: i.e., to every living thing.
9. The Flesh is put for the animal lusts, and the evil desires of the
Old nature: and for the Old nature itself

In Rom. 1:16-32; Rom. 2:1-29; Rom. 3:1-31; Rom. 4:1-25; Rom.
5:1-21; Rom. 6:1-23; Rom. 7:1-25; Rom. 8:1-39, there are many
examples. See
Rom. 8:4.-“Who walk not after the flesh”: i.e., the Old nature. This is
not the same as in verse 3.
Rom. 8:13.-“If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die”: i.e., if ye live and
are ruled by the principles of the Old nature. So in verse 12, and
frequently.

See articles on Romans in Things to Come, 1898 and 1899.
Gal. 5:6.-“Walk in the spirit ({6., in the New nature), and ye shall not
fulfil the lust of the flesh (i.e., of the old man).”
10. Blood is put for man, as we say “poor blood” for “poor
fellow”
Psa. 94:21.-“They gather themselves together against the soul of the
righteous ({6., against the righteous man), and condemn the innocent
blood “: i.e., the innocent man.
Pro. 1:11.-“Let us lay wait for blood”: i.e., for some man whom we may
kill.
Mat. 27:4.-“I have sinned in that | have betrayed the innocent blood”:
ie., the innocent man.
Act. 17:26.-God “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to
dwell on all the face of the earth”: i.e., out of one man God hath made
many different nations. Man is the same all over the world; and,
though there are different nations and races all over the world, they
are all descended from one man.
11. Flesh and Blood is put for the human nature as distinct from
the Divine Nature: or for the body of man as animal, mortal, and
corruptible

Mat. 16:17.-“Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” Here, the
Lord uses Peter’s human name “Simon” and his human parentage,
and “flesh and blood” in order to contrast and emphasize the
distinction between these and the Divine origin of the communication
and revelation. The figure of Synecdoché here puts the emphasis on
man and humanity: “No human being revealed this unto thee.”
1Со. 15:50.-“Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God”: i.e.,
no mortal human being can enter there. Man must be “born again,”
and “born of the Spirit,” and raised from the dead, or “changed” before
he can find entrance into that kingdom. See the rest of the verse, and
compare verses 42-49.
Gal. 1:16.-“l conferred not with flesh and blood”: i.e., with no human
being in contrast with God, Who alone revealed to him the Gospel
which he was to preach.
Eph. 6:12.-“We wrestle not against flesh and blood”: i.e., against
human beings, in contrast with wicked spiritual beings.

See under Metonymy of Adjunct.
Heb. 2:14.-“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same”: i.e., He became
flesh, and took part in a true and perfect human body.

12. The Head is put for the man himself

We use the figure when we reckon anything at so much “per head.”
Jdg. 5:30.-“To the head of a man, a damsel, two damsels”: {6., one or
two damsels per head, or for each man.
Here, there is a double Synecdoché, “a womb” being put for “a
damsel.” See below.
2Ki. 2:3.-“Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from
thy head (i.e., from thee) to-day?”
Psa. 3:3 (4).-‘The lifter up of mine head”: ᾖθ., of me: “my head”
meaning the same as “my soul.”
Psa. 7:16 (17).-“His mischief shall return upon his own head”: i.e.,
upon his own self.
Psa. 66:12.-“Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads”: {6., over
us.
Pro. 10:6.-“Blessings are upon the head of the just”: {6., upon the
man himself.
Isa. 35:10.-“With songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads”: {6.,
upon them, themselves.
So “blood” is said to be upon the head of anyone, i.e., where “blood” is
put for the guilt of blood-shedding (Metonymy of the effect) and “head”
is put (by Synecdoché) for the person himself.
2Sa. 1:16.-‘And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head”:
ie., thyself.
So 1Ki. 2:37. Eze. 33:4. Act. 18:6.
Mat. 27:25.-“His blood (i.e., the guilt of his blood-shedding, by
Metonymy of the effect) be on us, and on our children.”

13. The Skull, as a part of the man, is put for the man himself
Exo. 16:16.-“An omer a skull”: i.e., an omer per head, or, as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] , an omer “for every man.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.

And many other places.

14. The Face is put for the whole man, especially marking and

emphasizing his presence
See under Pleonasm.
Gen. 3:19.-“In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread.”

When the face perspires, the person himself perspires: but, as it is
only the face that is seen, it is that which is mentioned, and is thus put
for the whole man.

“Bread,” we have seen, is put by Synecdoché for food in general.
Gen. 19:21.-“See, | have accepted thy face (i.e., thee) concerning this
thing also.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] margin.

Gen. 32:20 (21).-“And afterward | will see his face”: i.e., himself.
There are three instances here.

2Sa. 17:11.-Hushai says to Absalom, “I counsel ... that thy face (i.e.,
thou thyself) go to battle.”
There can be but little doubt, as Dr. Ginsburg points out in his

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible (page 169), that the word а-Га
(baccrav) rendered to the battle, is an abbreviation in the MSS. for ᾱ-
rai (b’cheerbam), which means in the midst of them. And so the
Septuagint and the Vulgate translate it. Besides, -fa (ch’rab) is never
used in Samuel for battle. It is always iécia (milchamah). So that the
passage should read: “I counsel ... that thou go in the midst of them in
thine own person.”
1К!. 2:20.-“And the king said unto her, Ask, my mother; for | shall not
turn back thy face”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “I will not say thee nay,” with
the emphasis on “thee.”
1К!. 10:24.-“And all the earth sought the face of Solomon”: i.e., his
presence, so as to see him and to speak with him personally.
Job. 11:19.-“Many shall intreat thy face”: i.e., as in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “will
make suit unto thee.” See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin.
Psa. 42:5 (6).-“I shall yet praise Him for the salvations (Heterosis (q.v.
[Note: Which see.] ) of number: i.e., the great salvation) of His
countenance”: i.e., which He (i.e., His presence) shall give me.

So verse 11 (12): “I shall yet praise Him who is the salvations ({6.,
the great salvation) of my countenance (i.e., me myself), and my
God.” So Psa. 43:5.

Psa. 132:10.-“For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of
thine anointed.”

Here the figure emphasizes the last words, meaning not his face
merely, but David himself.

Pro. 28:21.-Το have respect of faces is not good”: i.e., as in A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] “persons,” so as to be influenced by personal appearance
rather than by justice and right.

Ecc. 8:1.-“A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine ({6., the man
himself), and his hardness is changed.” See under Metonymy.

Isa. 3:15.-“What mean ye that ye ... grind the faces of the poor?” So
Isa. 36:9 : “Turn away the face of one captain.”

Lam. 5:12.-“Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces (i.e.,
persons) of elders were not honoured.”
15. The Eye is put for the man himself, in respect to his vision,
mental or physical
Mat. 13:16.-“Blessed are your eyes ({6., ye), for they (i.e., ye) see.”
So Luk. 10:23.
1Co. 2:9.-“Eye hath not seen”: i.e., no one hath seen.
And many other passages.

16. The Eye lifted up is put for a proud man, and his high looks
Psa. 18:27 (28).-“Thou wilt save the afflicted people: but wilt bring
down high looks (Heb., soaring eyes)”: i.e., proud people.

So Pro. 6:17 (margin).
17. The Mouth is put for the whole man, in respect of his
speaking
Pro. 8:13.-“The froward mouth (i.e., person) do | hate.”
18. The Belly is put for man, in respect of his eating

Rom. 16:18.-“For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,
but their own belly”: {6., their own selves.
Php. 3:19.-“Whose God is their belly”: {6., themselves, and what they
can get.
Tit. 1:12.-“Slow bellies”: i.e., slow persons, who by reason of large
eating, have grown stout and move slowly.

19. The Womb is put for a female, in respect to her being

marriageable

Jdg. 5:30.-“A womb-two wombs for each man.” The A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.]
renders the figure here by the word “damsel.”

20. The Heart is put for the whole man, in respect to his

knowledge or affection
Gen. 31:20.-“And Jacob stole away the heart of Laban”: i.e., Jacob

baffled Laban’s knowledge by hiding his intentions. So in verse 26,

where the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our

English Bible, 1611.] renders it “unawares,” but see the margin on

verse 26; and in verse 27, “secretly.”

2Sa. 15:6.-“So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel”: i.e.,

gained them through getting their affection.

Luk. 21:34.-“Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts

(i.e., ye) be overcharged with surfeiting,” etc.

21. The Feet are put for the whole man, in respect to carefulness,
quickness, etc.

Pro. 1:16.-“Their feet (i.e., they) run to evil.”

Pro. 6:18.-“Feet (i.e., persons) that be swift in running to mischief.” So

Isa. 59:7.

Isa. 52:7.-“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that

bringeth good tidings”: i.e., how beautiful or pleasant is the coming of

him who brings good news. So Rom. 10:15.

Rom. 3:15.-Their feet (i.e., they) are swift to shed blood.”
ii. An integral part of men (collectively) is put for the whole, or
others associated with them
Exo. 12:40.-One person is mentioned; but with him are
comprehended his father Isaac, and his grandfather Abraham.

“Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
was four hundred and thirty years.”

Note that it does not say that Israel’s descendants dwelt in Egypt
430 years, as the commentators assume, but that their “sojourning”
lasted that time; reckoning from Abraham (who is included by
Synecdoché, as is Isaac also).

Four hundred and thirty years was the whole duration of the
sojourning; as is stated also in Gal. 3:16-17. While the 400 years’
sojourning is dated from Abraham’s “seed” (Isaac), who was born
thirty years later. See Gen. 15:18 and Act. 7:6. There are two
reckonings, starting from two different points, and both ending at the
Exodus.

Exo. 17:8; Exo. 17:13.-Amalek (in verse 8) is put for him and his
whole army. So Jos. 10:28; Jos. 10:40. 1Sa. 18:7, etc.
Deu. 33:7.-Only “Judah” is named in the blessing, but in company with
him Simeon is understood. For their inheritance and blessing was one.
Jos. 19:1 and Jdg. 1:3.

“And this for Judah,” etc.
1Ki. 8:66.-“David” is named, but Solomon, his son, is understood
together with him; see 2Ch. 7:10, where it is expressly added; and
1Ki. 10:9.
1К!. 10:11.-“The navy of Hiram” is named, but Solomon is included;
see 9:26, 27.
1К!. 11:32.-“One tribe” is mentioned; but, by Synecdoché, Simeon and
Benjamin are included, as well as the Levites and others who joined
the tribe. See 2Ch. 15:9. 1Ki. 12:23. 2Ch. 11:13. All these are
included, by Synecdoché, in 1Ki. 12:20.
2Ki. 17:18.-The Levites and Benjamites, etc., are included.
Job. 32:4.-Job is named, but the others are included.
Isa. 7:2; Isa. 7:5; Isa. 7:8-9; Isa. 9:9.-“Ephraim” is named, because in
that tribe was Samaria, the royal city; and because out of that tribe
was Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. But by Synecdoché all the ten
tribes are included.
Psa. 80:2.-“Ephraim”™* [Note: One of the ancient readings called

Severin has this: “For the sons of Ephraim,” etc.] includes the ten

tribes, while “Benjamin” includes Judah; and “Manasseh’” includes the

two-and-a-half tribes.

Psa. 80:1 (2).-“Joseph” (whose son Ephraim was) is put for all Israel.

Amo. 5:15; Amo. 6:6.-“Joseph’” is put for the ten tribes or the kingdom

of Israel.

Jer. 6:1.-“Benjamin” is put for all Judah, on account of their close

connection with the Gibeathites (see Jdg. 19:16. Hos. 9:9; Hos. 10:9).
iii. A part of a thing is put for the whole of the thing
1. A Field (uaa, sadeh) is put for a country or region
Gen. 14:7.-“And they smote the whole field (i.e., country) of the
Amalakites.”
1Sa. 27:7.-“David dwelt in the field (i.e., country) of the Philistines.”
2. Corner is put for tower, which was usually placed at the corner
Zep. 1:16.-“A day of trump and alarm against the fenced cities, and
against the high corners”: i.e., towers (with A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ). The word is so
translated in margin of chap. 3:6.
3. The Baptism of John is put for his ministry
Not everywhere, but in a few passages.
Act. 1:22.-“Beginning from the baptism (i.e., the ministry) of John,
unto that same day that he (Christ) was taken up from us.”
So Act. 10:37.
4. Stones is put for the restored buildings
Psa. 102:14 (15).-“Thy servants take pleasure in her stones.”
5. Wall is put for the whole city encompassed by it
Amo. 1:7.-“| will send a fire on the wall of Gaza (i.e., | will burn the city
of Gaza with fire, as the rest of the verse declares), which shall devour
the palaces thereof.” Amo. 1:10; Amo. 1:14; compare verse 12; and
2:2, 5, etc.
6. In like manner Gate is put for the whole city

Gen. 22:17.-“Thy seed shall possess the gate ({6., the cities) of his
enemies.”

The phrase “within thy gates” means within thy cities. See Exo.
20:10. Deu. 12:12; Deu. 14:27; Deu. 16:5.
Psa. 87:2.-“The Lord loveth the gates (i.e., the city) of Zion more than
all the dwellings of Jacob.”
Jer. 15:7.-“And | will fan them with a fan in the gates (i.e., cities) of the
land.”
7. Gate is also put for the inhabitants of the city, or for the people
who assemble at its gates

This may also be considered as Metonymy of the Subject.
В. 3:11.-“All the gate ({6., the people assembling there) of my
People doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.”
Rth. 4:10.-“That the name of the dead be not cut off ... from the gate
of his place”: {6., from his own city and People.

The two are combined in Isa. 14:31 : “Howl, O gate; cry, O city.” In
neither case could the gate or the city cry or howl.

Two classes of people are addressed: first “gate” (a part of the
whole) is put, by Synecdoché, for those who assemble there; and then
“city” is put, by Metonymy of the Subject, for all the inhabitants of the
city.

8. The Death of Christ is put for the atonement and its results
(and see under Metalepsis)
Rom. 5:10.-“We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son”: i.e.,
not by the act or article of death only, but by the atonement of which it
formed only a part.

So 1Co. 11:26. Col. 1:22.

Heb. 2:14.-“That through death he might destroy him that had the
power of death.”

Here, the first time the word “death” is used, it is put for the
atonement associated with it; and the second time it means literally
the article of death. See under Antanaciasis.

9. The Knob of the Roll is put for the MS. or book itself
Heb. 10:7.-“In the volume of the book it is written of me.”

Here ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου (en kephalidi bibliou), in the head of the
book (κεφαλίς, kephalis, head), is not a synonym for roll, as some try
to show; but it is the head or knob of the cylinder on which the
manuscript was rolled, and which is put, by Synecdoché, for the roll
and volume itself. It thus corresponds with the Hebrew in Psa. 40:7
(8): аТ6 ПОГ (Bimegillath sepher), in the scroll of the book, and
is not a paraphrase, but gives the correct sense.
In Heb. 10:7 this book may be taken as referring to Psa. 40:7 (8); but
what about Psa. 40:7 (8), where the same phrase occurs? What is the
book referred to there? Surely it must be the book of the eternal
covenant referred to in Psa. 139:16.
iv. A part of time is put for the whole time
1. A Year is put for time, definite and indefinite
Isa. 61:2.-“To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord”: i.e., the time
of Christ’s coming.
Isa. 63:4.-“The year of my redeemed is come.”
Jer. 11:23.-"I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of
their visitation.”
2. In the Day is put for an indefinite time
Gen. 2:4.-“When they were created,
“In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.”
Here “in the day” in the second line answers to “when’” in the first
line.
Gen. 2:17.-“In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”
46] (ϱγφπη), in the day.

A noun with the preposition followed by the verb in the infinitive, as
here, becomes an adverb of time, and means simply when, or after
then, or after that.

Lev. 13:14.-“In the day that raw flesh appear”: in A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
“when,” and in Π.Ν [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,
“whensoever.”

Lev. 14:57.-“To teach in the day of the unclean, and in the day of the
clean.”

Both A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
renders this: “To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean” (see
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] margin).

Deu. 21:16.-“In the day that (/.e., when) he maketh his sons to inherit
that which he hath.”
2Sa. 21:12.-“In the day that (i.e., when) the Philistines had slain Saul
in Gilboa.”
1Ki. 2:37.-“It shall be that, on the day thou goest out, and passest
over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt
surely die.”

Then, after Shimei had gone out, and been to Gath to seek his
servants, who had run away, and had come back again, “it was told
Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was
come again” (verse 41). The king sent for Shimei; and said: “Did | not
make thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, saying,
Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die?”

After all this, Solomon proceeded to make Shimei “know for certain
that he should surely die.”

In this case Shimei had been not merely outside his house, but far
away to Gath, one of the royal cities of the Philistines; and had not
only consumed some time on his journeys out and home, but, after he
got there, he had to seek his lost servants out and find them.
Therefore “on the day” could neither be intended nor taken in its literal
meaning; but, by Synecdoché, for any indefinite yet certain time. It
was so taken by Solomon here: and it is perfectly certain that it is to be
so understood in Gen. 3:1-24 for in verse 19 the Lord distinctly says:
“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return.”

Not “in the day” that Adam ate of the forbidden fruit; for the Lord
contemplates him as living on, and he did live for nine hundred and
thirty years (Gen. 5:5). The interest of the passage in 1Ki. 2:1-46 is
that the words are used in exactly the same connection, and with the
corresponding figure, Polyptoton (q.v. [Note: Which see.] ), “dying thou
wilt die,” TU 1]: (meth tamuth).
Those who see and understand the figure Synecdoché, here
employed, need not trouble themselves to invent some new and
strange and unscriptural theories as to death; or resort to strained
interpretations in order to explain a self-created difficulty.
2Ki. 20:1.-“In those days (i.e., the days of Sennacherib’s invasion)
Hezekiah was sick unto death, and the prophet Isaiah came unto him.”
Psa. 18:18 (19).-“They prevented me in the day of my calamity”: i.e.,
when | was in trouble.

Isa. 11:16.-“Like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of
the land of Egypt”: i.e., not the actual day (for it was dark), but at the
time or on the occasion when he came up, etc.

Jer. 11:3-4.-“Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this
covenant, which | commanded your fathers in the day that | brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt.”

And in verse 7: “I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day
that | brought them up out of the land of Egypt.”

Now the commands and protest referred to are written in Deu.
27:1-26, and were given some forty years after the Exodus. It is clear
from this that ЭЁЙ (θεγφπὴ) is not to be taken literally, and that “in the
day” is put by Synecdoché for the whole time covered by the events
referred to. See Jer. 31:32; Jer. 34:13. Eze. 20:5-6.

Eze. 36:33.-“Then saith Adonai Jehovah: In the day that | shall have
cleansed you from all your iniquities, | shall also cause you to dwell in
the cities, and the wastes will be builded.”

It is clear that all this building will not be done in a day, but it will all
be done when the time comes for the Lord’s word to be fulfilled.

Eze. 38:18.-“And it shall come to pass in the day of Gog’s coming
against the land of Israel,” etc.

Here, the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] renders а©Й (Буфт)‚ at the same time; and
the R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , in that day.

And more generally days are used for time.
Psa. 102:11 (12).-“My days are like a shadow that declineth”: i.e., my
life.
Psa. 103:15.-“As for man, his days are as grass”: i.e., he himself, or
his life.
Isa. 4:1.-“And in that day (i.e., at that time) seven women shall take
hold of one man,” etc.
Isa. 9:4 (3).-“Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden ... as in the day
of Midian”: i.e., at the time when Midian was broken.
Hos. 9:9.-“As in the days of Gibeah”: i.e., at the time when the sons of
Belial sinned at Gibeah (Jdg. 19:22-25).
Mat. 2:1.-“In the days (i.e., in the reign) of Herod the king.”
Act. 5:36.-“For before these days”: {6., before this time.

The plural days is put for a full year.
Gen. 24:55.-“Let the damsel abide with us days at the least ten; after
that she shall go.” This is, according to the A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin, “a full
year or at least ten months.”
Gen. 40:4.-“And they continued days (i.e., a year) in ward.”
Exo. 13:10.-“Thou wilt therefore keep this ordinance at its appointed
season: from days to days”: .e., from year to year.
Lev. 25:29.-“If a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within days (i.e., a
full year) may he redeem it.” Or as in R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] , “for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.”
Jdg. 11:40.-“The daughters of Israel went from days to days (i.e.,
“yearly,” as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.] ) to talk with the daughter of Jephthah the
Gileadite four days in the year.” The verb uda (tahnah) occurs only
twice: here and in chap. 5:11. It means to rehearse, to talk with or of.
Jdg. 17:10.-“I shall give thee ten shekels of silver for the days”: i.e., by
the year, as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of
our English Bible, 1611.]
1Sa. 1:3.-“And this man (Elkanah) went up out of his city from days to
days (i.e., from year to year, A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or
current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] margin and R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] ; or, yearly, A.V. [Note: The Authorized
Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ) to worship and to
sacrifice.”

In verse 7, the Hebrew word “year” is used literally.
1Sa. 27:7.-“And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
Philistines was days and four months”: /е., a full year and four
months.
1Ki. 17:7.-“And it came to pass at the end of days that the brook dried
up, because there had been no rain in the land.” The A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “after a while” is not far out.
It may mean a full year; but it evidently must include a whole season
during which rain might have been expected.
In chap. 18:1, “many days” include the whole three years.
Amo. 4:4.-“Bring ... your tithes after three of days”: i.e., in the third
year (according to the Law, Deu. 14:28).

3. The Sabbath is sometimes put for the full week
Mat. 28:1.-“In the end of the sabbaths”: i.e., at the close of the week.
Luk. 18:12.-“I fast twice in the sabbath”: i.e., in the week.
1Со. 16:1.-“On the first of the sabbath”: {6., on the first day of the
week.
4. The Morning is put for a more lengthened period or continuous

time

Job. 7:17-18.-“What is man ... that thou shouldest visit him every
morning?” i.e., continually.
Psa. 73:14.-“All the day long have | been plagued and chastened

every morning”: i.e., continually.

Psa. 101:8.-“At morn | will destroy the wicked of the land.” Not “early,”

as in A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English

Bible, 1611.] ; nor, “morning by morning,” as in R.V. [Note: The

Revised Version, 1881.] , as though in millennial days each morning

would commence with, and each day begin with, executions! It means

more than that. It means continually; so that all through the millennium

all workers of iniquity will be continually cut off.

Ecc. 11:6.-“In the morning sow thy seed”: {6., early and continuously.

Isa. 33:2.-“Be thou their arm every morning”: i.e., continually.

Lam. 3:23.-The Lord’s mercies and compassions are “new every

morning”: i.e., always and continually new.

5. Evening and Morning are put for the full day; or, the whole of a
day and night

Gen. 1:5; Gen. 1:8; Gen. 1:13; Gen. 1:19; Gen. 1:23; Gen. 1:31.
6. Hour is put for a special time or season
Joh. 4:23.-“The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.” See this passage and
verse 24, under Hendiadys below.
Joh. 5:25.-“The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear
the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.” Note that in
this almighty act Christ’s title is “Son of God”; while, in verse 27, He
executes judgment in the earth because He is the “Son of man.” So
Joh. 5:28; Joh. 16:2 (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “Нте”); 17:1. 1Th. 2:17 (A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
“time”). Philem. 15 (A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text
of our English Bible, 1611.] ‚ “season”). 1Jn. 2:18, twice (A.V. [Note:
The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
“time”).

7. In Chronology a part of a time or period is sometimes put for

the whole of such period

1Ki. 2:11.-“Seven years” is put for seven years and a half. Compare
2598. 2:11.
2Ki. 24:8.-“Three months” is put for three months and ten days.
Compare 2Ch. 36:9.
Hendiadys; or, Two for One

Two words used, but one thing meant
Hen-dor-a-dy"s, from ἕν (hen), one, διὰ (dia), by, δίς (dis) two (from
δύο, two). Lit, one by means of two. Two words employed, but only
one thing, or idea, intended. One of the two words expresses the
thing, and the other (of synonymous, or even different, signification,
not a second thing or idea) intensifies it by being changed (if a noun)
into an adjective of the superlative degree, which is, by this means,
made especially emphatic.

The figure is truly oriental, and exceedingly picturesque. It is found
in Latin as well as in Hebrew and Greek, and is very frequently used in
both Old and New Testaments.

The two words are of the same parts of speech: i.e., two nouns (or
two verbs) always joined together by the conjunction “and.” The two
nouns are always in the same case.

An example or two from the Latin will serve to explain the true
nature of this figure, which is one of the most important in the Bible.
