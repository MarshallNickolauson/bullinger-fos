1. Parts and Members of Man; or, of the Human Body
A Soul is attributed to God
in condescension, so that we may understand His essence and
will: i.e., God Himself.
Lev. 26:11.-“And | will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul
shall not abhor you”: i.e., / myself (see under /diom and Synecdoche).
So Psa. 11:5. Isa. 1:14; Isa. 42:1. Jer. 5:9; Jer. 5:29; Jer. 15:1
(rendered “mind”). Mat. 12:18. Heb. 10:38.
Hence the expression “to swear by one’s soul,” Jer. 51:14. (See
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] тагд. [Note: arg. Margin.] ) Amo. 6:8, where it is
rendered, “by himself.”

Lam. 3:20.-“And thy soul will condescend to me.”

This was the primitive text, and we find here one of the eighteen
emendations of the Sopherim, who altered it to, “My soul is humbled in
me.” (See Appendix E).

Jerusalem, personified, speaks, and says (verses 19, 20)
addressing God:

“Remember my misery and my forlorn state,

The wormwood and the gall.

Yea, verily, Thou wilt remember,

And Thy soul will mourn over me.

This | recall to my heart,

Therefore | have hope.”
A Body is used of Christ.

Col. 2:17.-“Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body of
Christ is the substance”: i.e., Christ Himself, either personally (verse
9) or mystically.* [№1е: See The Mystery, by the same author and
publisher.]

See under Ellipsis, and compare 1Ti. 3:16. Eph. 1:22-23; Eph.
4:12; Eph. 4:15-16.

The Head is spoken of Christ.
1Co. 11:3.-“The head of Christ is God.” This is in respect to His
human nature, and is spoken of Christ as man. Joh. 14:28. Rom. 8:29.

So Christ is said to be head of the Body: i.e., the Mystical Body.
Eph. 1:22; Eph. 4:15. Col. 1:18. See 1Co. 12:1-31. Hence
ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι (anakephalaiésasthai), to reduce to one head, ог
to head up in Eph. 1:10.

The Face, to signify presence.

It is used of the Divine presence in happiness and of Divine favour.
Psa. 16:11 : “In thy face (i.e., presence) is fulness of joy.” So Psa.
17:15.

Exo. 33:20; Exo. 33:23.-Compare 1Co. 13:12. Jon. 1:3. Psa. 51:11
(13).

Psa. 31:20 (21).-“Thou wilt hide therein the secret of thy face”: i.e., of
thy presence, in Divine grace and favour.

Psa. 17:2.-“Let my sentence come forth from thy face”: i.e., Thy
presence or Thyself, in righteousness and truth.

Psa. 89:15 (16).-“They will walk, О Lord, in the light of thy face”: i.e.,
in the light of Thy presence, enjoying Thy favour and blessing.
1Ch. 29:12.-“Riches and honour come from thy face”: A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] , “of
Thee”: i.e., from Thy grace and favour.

So Num. 6:25-26. Psa. 4:6 (7); 31:16 (17); 80:3, 7, 19 (4, 8, 20).
Dan. 9:17.
Mat. 18:10.-“Their angels do always behold the face of my Father”:
i.e., enjoy or stand in His presence, which is explained by 2Ki. 25:19.
Est. 1:14.

Hence the hiding of God’s face meant the withholding of His grace
and favour.

Psa. 13:1 (2): 27:9; 30:7 (8). Eze. 39:24.

It is used of the Divine presence in anger and judgment.
Psa. 9:3 (4).-“They shall fall and perish from thy face” ({6., at Thy
presence manifested in judgment).
Psa. 21:9 (10).-“Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of
Thy face” (i.e., Thy presence in judgment).

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] actually renders this “anger”: but not in

Psa. 34:16.-“The face of the Lord is against them that do evil” ({6., the
anger of the Lord, as in 21:9 and Lam. 4:16. See A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] marg.
[Note: arg. Margin.] )

2Th. 1:9.-“The face of the Lord.” Here, it is rendered “presence.” See
under Ellipsis. So 1Pe. 3:12.

It is used of Jehovah Himself, for emphasis.

Exo. 33:14-15, as is explained in verse 16, and Isa. 63:9. Exo. 23:20,
etc., where doubtless Christ is meant by “the angel.”

So Exo. 23:15 : “None shall appear before my face (i.e., Me) empty.”
Lev. 17:10.-“I will set my face (i.e., myself) against that soul.” So Jer.
21:10.

Hence the shewbread was called the bread of the presence (lit.,
the bread of the faces), because it was in the holy place in the
manifested presence of God.

Exo. 25:30.-“Thou shalt set upon the table the bread of the faces
(2222, pahneem) before me (2222, I'phahnai) alway.” Observe
the Paronomasia (q.v. [Note: Which see_] ).

Psa. 27:8.-“Seek ye my face”: i.e., seek me.

Psa. 100:2.-“Come before his face (i.e., before Him) with singing.”
Psa. 105:4.-“Seek his face (i.e., Himself) evermore.” So 2Sa. 21:1 :
“And David enquired of the Lord”: lit., sought the face of the Lord. (See
A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )

Psa. 139:7.-“Whither shall | flee from thy face?” (A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] ,
presence): i.e., from Thee.

2Ch. 7:14.
Hence “Face to face” means great intimacy. Deu. 5:4; Deu. 34:10.
Num. 12:6-7, etc., which is explained by Exo. 20:18-21. In Num. 12:8
we have “mouth to mouth” for the first time. See below.

Eyes are attributed to God.

2Sa. 16:22.-“The Lord will behold with his eye.” This was the primitive
text; and is one of the eighteen passages altered by the Sopherim
(see Appendix E) to “mine eye,” which has been taken (by Metonymy)
to stand for tears or affliction.
Zec. 2:8 (12).-“He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye.” So
the primitive Hebrew text read, but was altered by the Sopherim to “his
eye.” See Appendix E.

Eyes are used of God’s observation.
Psa. 11:4.-“His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men”: i.e.,
the Lord observeth and noteth and understandeth the acts and ways
of men. See Job. 34:21 : “His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he
seeth all his goings.” So Isa. 1:16. Heb. 4:13.
Hos. 13:14.-“Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes”: i.e., | will not
repent. So Rom. 11:29.

Hence the phrase to “hide from one’s eyes” means not to look
upon or regard. See Isa. 65:16. Amo. 9:3.

Eyes are used of God’s grace and favour.

Deu. 11:12.-"The eyes of the Jehovah thy God, are always upon it”:
i.e., regarding the Land with Divine benevolence. So 1Ki. 9:3. 2Ch.
16:9.
Psa. 32:8.-A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] : “I will guide thee with mine eye.” Π.Ν. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] : “I will counsel thee with mine eye upon
thee.” Lit, | cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee: i.e., | will
cause My Spirit to graciously to inform thee and lead thee in the right
way. (See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )

So 1Ре. 3:12. See above.

Hence the phrases, “Mine eye spared them” (Eze. 20:17): i.e., |
was propitious toward them, and showed them My favour. So Eze.
5:11; Eze. 7:4.
“lam cut off from before thine eyes” (Psa. 31:22): 18., | have lost
Thy favour.

“To keep as the apple of the eye” (Deu. 32:10).

Ears are attributed to God.

Psa. 10:17.-“Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.”
Psa. 31:2 (3).-“Bow down thine ear to me.”
Psa. 40:6 (7).-“Mine ears hast thou opened or bored”: i.e., Christ says,
“A servant for ever hast thou made me.” See margin, and compare
Exo. 21:6 and Deu. 15:17; and see under Metonymy.
Psa. 55:1 (2).-“Give ear to my prayer, O God.”
Psa. 71:2.-“Incline thine ear unto me and save me.”
Psa. 130:2.-“Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the
voice of my supplications.”
Eze. 8:18.-“Though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will |
not hear them.”
Jam. 5:4.-“The cries of them which have reaped are entered into the
ears of the Lord of sabaoth.”
See also Isa. 50:4-5, where Messiah speaks.
Nostrils are attributed to God.
Exo. 15:8.-“With the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
together.”
Job. 4:9.-“By the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.”

The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] margin says “That is, by his anger,” as Isa.
30:33. See Exo. 15:8.

Deu. 33:10.-“They shall put (or let them put) incense to thy nose.” A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] , “before thee.”
(But see A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] )

Psa. 18:15.-“At the blast of the breath of thy nostril.”
Eze. 8:17.-“Lo, they put the branch (the Asherah) to my nose.” So the
Heb. Text originally read, but was altered by the Sopherim, “to their
nose.” See Appendix E.

A Mouth and Lips and a Tongue are attributed to God, in
connection with His will, His word, His commands, etc.
Num. 12:8.-“With him (Moses) will | speak mouth to mouth”: ie.,

familiarly, and with really audible words.
Deu. 8:3.-“By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah
doth man live.” So Mat. 4:4.
Jos. 9:14.-“Апа the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel
at the mouth of the Lord.”
Job. 11:5.-“Oh that God would speak and open his lips against thee.”
Isa. 11:4.-“He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with
the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.”

This is quoted of Christ in 2Th. 2:8.
Isa. 30:27.-“His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a
devouring fire.”
Isa. 55:11.-“So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.”
A Voice is attributed to God.

Isa. 30:30.-“Jehovah shall cause the glory of His voice to be heard”:
ie., as in AV. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] ,
“his glorious voice,” thus interpreting and rendering the Hypallage (q.v.
[Note: Which зее.] ). See Psa. 29:1-11
Arms are attributed to God, to indicate His strength and power, which

in men lies so largely in the arms.
Exo. 15:16. Job. 40:9.-“Hast thou an arm like God?”
Psa. 77:15 (16).-“Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people.” (5ο
Exo. 6:6. Deu. 9:29. Psa. 136:12).
Psa. 79:11.-“According to the greatness of thine arm.” Here, the A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] both actually
render it “thy power” (marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] thine arm).
Psa. 89:10 (11).-“Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of
thy strength.” So R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] But A.V.
[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,
1611.] , “with thy strong arm” (see margin).

Isa. 51:9.-“Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord.” See
also under Epizeuxis.

Isa. 59:16.-“Therefore his arm brought salvation.” So Isa. 63:5.

Isa. 62:8.-“Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of
his strength”: i.e., by His strong arm, or, His strength.

Luk. 1:51.-“He hath shewed strength with his arm.”

Psa. 89:13 (14).-“Thou hast an arm with might” (see A.V. [Note: The
Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and
R.V. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.] margin).

Here A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
both render it “a mighty arm.”

Isa. 30:30.-Jehovah “shall shew the lighting down of his arm.” Here

His voice is used of thunder, and His arm denotes His lightning.

The Arm of the Lord not only denotes power, but power executed
in judgment.
See Psa. 136:12.
The Arm of the Lord is also used of the making known of His
grace in wondrous power.

Isa. 52:10.-“Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all
the nations.” Verses 7, 8 clearly show that this was His power
manifested in grace to Israel.
Isa. 53:1.-“Who hath believed our report (see Metonymy of Adjunct)?
and to whom is the arm of Jehovah revealed?”

Compare Joh. 12:38 and Rom. 1:16.

A Hand is attributed to God, by which various powers and
actions are indicated Power and Miraculous Operation.
Num. 11:23.-“Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short?” i.e., has His power got

less? So Isa. 59:1.
Job. 10:8.-“Thine hands have made me and fashioned me.”
Job. 12:9.-“The hand of Jehovah hath wrought this.”
Job. 12:10.-“In whose hand is the life of every living thing.”
Psa. 8:6 (7).-“Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
thy hands.”
Psa. 95:5.-“His hands formed the dry land.”

time to recover the remnant of His People.”
Purpose.

Act. 4:28.-“To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
before to be done.”

Protection, gracious deliverance, and security.
Psa. 31:5 (6).-“Into thine hand | commit my spirit.”
Psa. 144:7.-“Send thine hand from above: rid me, and deliver me out
of great waters.” See under Heterosis.
Joh. 10:28.-“Neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.”
Joh. 10:29.-“None can pluck them out of my Father’s hand.”
Act. 4:30.-“By stretching forth thine hand to heal.”
Providence.
Psa. 104:28.-“Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.”
Psa. 145:16.-“Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of
every living thing.”
Prospering.
Neh. 2:8.-“The king granted me, according to the good hand of my
God upon me.”
Neh. 2:18.-‘Then | told them of the hand of my God which was good
upon me.”
So Ezr. 7:6; Ezr. 7:9; Ezr. 7:28; Ezr. 8:18.
Preservation.
Joh. 10:28.-“Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” And
verse 29: “No man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.”
Punishment.
Exo. 9:3.-“Behold the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle,” etc.
Job. 19:21.-“The hand of God (Eloah) hath touched me.” (See under
Tapeinosis).
Psa. 21:8 (9).-“Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies,” etc.
Psa. 17:14.-“From men which are thy hand, O Jehovah” (marg. [Note:
arg. Margin.] , from men by thine hand. Compare R.V. [Note: The
Revised Version, 1881.] ): /е., “from the men who are instruments in
Thy hand, O Jehovah.”
Psa. 38:2 (3).-“Thy hand presseth me sore.”
Act. 13:11.-“And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee.”
Eze. 39:21.-“All the heathen shall see my judgment that | have
executed, and my hand that | have laid upon them.”
So Job (23:2) uses the word “hand,” by Metonymy, for his
punishment. “My hand ({6., punishment) is heavier than my groaning.”
(See A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English
Bible, 1611.] marg. [Note: arg. Margin.] ).

See 27:11. Hence the

Idiomatic Expressions.

“To stretch forth the hand’: i.e., to send judgments upon. Exo. 7:5.
Psa. 138:7. Isa. 5:25; Isa. 9:12; Isa. 9:17; Isa. 9:21; Isa. 10:4; Isa.
14:27; Isa. 31:3. Jer. 6:12. Eze. 16:27; Eze. 25:7. Zep. 1:4; Zep. 2:13.

“To put forth the hand”: i.e., to inflict punishment. Job. 1:11; Job.
2:5.

“To shake the hand.” Ι58. 19:16.

“To make the hand heavy’: i.e., to make the chastisement severe.
Psa. 32:4.

“To make the hand light’: i.e., to reduce the chastisement. 138.
6:5.
“To withdraw the hand’: i.e., to take away the punishment. Eze.
20:22.

“To turn the hand upon”: i.e., to repeat the punishment. Isa. 1:25.

Jehovah asks why this should be in verse 5.

“To lift up or spread out the hand”: i.e., to call for the receiving of
mercy, or invite to receive. Pro. 1:24. Isa. 49:22; Isa. 65:2.

“To open the hand”: i.e., to bestow or give bountifully. See Psa.
104:28; Psa. 145:16 above.

“To clap or smite the hands together’: i.e., to express derision or
disdainful anger Eze. 21:17; Eze. 22:13.

“To lift up the hand’: i.e., to swear solemnly.
Exo. 6:8 (margin). Deu. 32:40. Eze. 20:5-6; Eze. 36:7, etc. (See
also Gen. 14:22). This explains the difficult verse Exo. 17:16. See the
Text and margins of A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] and R.V. [Note: The Revised Version,
1881.] There is the Ellipsis of the verb which is clearly understood
from the idiom, thus “Surely the hand is [lifted up] on the banner of
Jehovah.” So that the A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current
Text of our English Bible, 1611.] is quite correct in sense: “The Lord
hath sworn.” (See Ginsburg’s Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, page
382, 383).

“The hand of the Lord upon” a man denoted also the power of the
prophetic spirit.

1Ki. 18:46. 2Ki. 3:15. Eze. 1:3; Eze. 8:1; Eze. 33:22.

A Right Hand is attributed to God; to denote the highest power, and
most Divine authority.

Exo. 15:6; Exo. 15:12. Psa. 77:10 (11); 118:15, 16; 139:10. Isa.
48:13.

It denotes also His grace and mercy in delivering and saving His
people.
Psa. 18:35 (36); 20:6 (7) (margin); 44:3 (4); 63:8 (9); 80:15, 17 (16,
18).

It is used also of the place accorded to Christ in His human nature
as now exalted.

Psa. 110:1. Mat. 26:64. Mar. 16:19. Act. 2:33-34; Act. 7:55-56.
Rom. 8:34. Col. 3:1, ete. Eph. 1:20-22. Heb. 1:3-4; Heb. 8:1.

So Christ dignity is further described by the figure
THEOPREPOS, worthy of a god. 1Co. 15:25. Eph. 4:10, ete.

A Finger is attributed to God, to denote the putting forth of His

formative power, and the direct and immediate act of God.

Exo. 8:19; Exo. 31:18. Psa. 8:3 (4). So Luk. 11:20, by which,

A Heart is attributed to God.

Gen. 6:6; Gen. 8:21. Jer. 19:5 (6). 1Sa. 13:14 : “A man after his

own heart”: i.e., His own Divine and eternal purpose; having regard,
not to David’s worthiness or unworthiness, but to God’s own will. So

Act. 13:22. See also Jer. 32:41.

Bowels are attributed to God; to denote His mercies and His pity.
All these figures of Anthropopatheia are figures of Metonomy, by

which one thing is put for another. Here, because, when a person is

much moved by deep feeling, there is a movement of the bowels, so

they are put, by Metonymy, for the feeling itself.

Isa. 63:15.-“Where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy

bowels and of thy mercies towards me?” So Jer. 31:20.

Luk. 1:78.-“Through the bowels of the mercy of our God.” (See A.V.

[Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our English Bible,

1611.] margin). Here it is translated, “through the tender mercy of our

God.”

Mat. 9:36.-“He was moved with compassion”: /#, his bowels moved.

So Mat. 14:14; Mat. 15:32. Mar. 1:41; Mar. 6:34, etc. (See also Gen.

43:30. 1Ki. 3:26. And compare this as attributed to God, Psa. 51:1 (3):

“The multitude of thy tender mercies.”) So Isa. 63:7.
A Bosom is attributed to God; to denote comfort and rest.
Psa. 74:11 (the hand in the bosom denoting ease, according to
Pro. 19:24; Pro. 26:15).

Isa. 40:11. Joh. 1:18 (“In the bosom of the Father”). Num. 11:12.
Feet are attributed to God; to denote His presence in the earth, in
power, in universal dominion.

Isa. 66:1. Psa. 74:3; Psa. 110:1. Isa. 60:13. In this respect the
earth is spoken of as His “footstool.”
Footsteps are also attributed to God.
Psa. 77:19 (20); 89:51 (52).

2. Human Affections and Feelings are attributed to God
Human affections and feelings are attributed to God: not that He has
such feelings; but, in infinite condescension, He is thus spoken of in
order to enable us to comprehend Him.
Rejoicing is attributed to God.
Psa. 104:31.-“The Lord shall rejoice in his works.” So Isa. 62:5. Deu.
28:63; Deu. 30:9. Jer. 32:41, etc.
Sorrow and Grief are attributed to God.

Gen. 6:6.-“It grieved him at his heart.”
Jdg. 10:16.-“His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.”
Psa. 78:40.-“How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and
grieve Him in the desert!”
Isa. 63:10.-“They rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit.” So Eph. 4:30.

See Zec. 11:8. Eze. 6:9.

Repentance is attributed to God.

Gen. 6:6.-“It repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth.”

So Exo. 32:12; Exo. 32:14. 2Sa. 24:16. Psa. 106:45. Jer. 18:8; Jer.
26:3. Hos. 11:8. Amo. 7:3; Amo. 7:6. Joe. 2:13-14.
Anger, Vengeance, and Hatred are attributed to God.

Exo. 15:7.-“Thou sentest forth thy wrath.”
Psa. 5:5 (6).-“Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.”
Isa. 1:14.-“Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul
hateth.”
Isa. 1:24.-‘l will ... avenge me of mine enemies.”
Jer. 9:9.-“Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?”
Nah. 1:2.-“God (El) is jealous, and Jehovah revengeth; the Lord
revengeth, and is furious: the Lord will take vengeance on his
adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.”

So Eze. 5:13. Psa. 2:12; Psa. 85:5 (6). Deu. 1:37; Deu. 32:16. 1Ki.
11:9.

Comfort is spoken of God.

Isa. 57:6.-“Should | receive comfort in these?”
Eze. 5:13.-“And | will be comforted.”
Jealousy.

Exo. 20:5.-“For | the Lord thy God am a jealous*{Note: |t is noteworthy
that Inco (kabah) out of its six occurrences, is, in five, connected
with ©Г (EN, God.) God (Ε).”
Num. 25:11.-“That | consumed not the children of Israel in my
jealousy.”
Deu. 32:16.-“They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods.” So in
verse 21, and in 1Ki. 14:22. Isa. 9:7 (6). Eze. 8:3. Joe. 2:18.
Zec. 1:14.-“| am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great
jealousy.” See also under Polyptoton.

Zeal.
Isa. 9:7 (6).-“The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”

Displeasure.

Zec. 1:15.- am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
ease: for | was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the
affliction.”
Pity.

Joe. 2:18.-“Then will Jehovah ... pity His People.”

3. Human Actions are attributed to God.

Knowing. Not actual knowledge as such, but the acquiring of

knowledge as though before ignorant.
Gen. 18:21.-“I will go down now, and see whether they have done
altogether according to the cry of it,t [Note: The Severus Codex reads
1 for ™: ie., their cry, instead of “the cry of it.” See Ginsburg’s
Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, page 412.] which is come unto me;
and if not, | will know.”
Gen. 22:12.-“Now | know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son from me.”

God, of course, knew it already; but, in wondrous condescension,

He stoops to make Abraham understand.
Deu. 8:2.-“The Lord thy God led thee, etc. ... to know what was in
thine heart.” So Deu. 13:3 (4). The Lord knew already: “For He
knoweth the way of the righteous” (Psa. 1:6; Psa. 31:7 (8). 2Ti. 2:19).
Psa. 14:2.-“The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of
men, to see (i.€., to know) if there were any that did understand,” etc.

So Psa. 53:2 (3). (See also this verse under Epanadiplosis).

The very action of our prayer to God involves an Anthropopatheia.
God knows all our petitions before we pray. And yet we have to pray
as though we were making them known to Him. Php. 4:6.

Not Knowing, the opposite of knowledge, is attributed to God.
Gen. 3:9.-“The Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
art thou?” This implies ignorance. The Lord knew; but the question is
put to make Adam know and realise his changed condition.
Gen. 4:9.-“Where is Abel thy brother?”

These first two Divine questions in the Bible are very significant.
See under Erotesis.
Num. 22:9.-“What men are these with thee?”
1Ki. 19:9; 1Ki. 19:13.-“What doest thou here, Elijah?”

So 2Ki. 20:14-15. Isa. 39:3-4.

To this figure must be referred the passages which represent God
as doubting, or having to wait to see certain results.

Eze. 20:8. Hos. 11:8-9.

Also when God tries, or proves, or searches, it is not that He does
not know, but that He may make others know.
Psa. 7:9 (10).-“The righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.” (See
Metonymy of subject).
So Jer. 11:20. Rev. 2:23. 1Co. 2:10.

So Christ declares that He will say:

Mat. 7:23 : “I never knew you”; 25:12: “I know you not.” Luk. 13:25;
Luk. 13:27.

The questions of Christ in the New Testament are to be referred to
the same Figure.
Mat. 22:20.-“Whose is this image and superscription?”

Also verse 45: “If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?”
Luk. 8:45.-“Who touched me?”

Remembering.

Gen. 8:1.-“And God remembered Noah.” Gen. 30:22. 1Sa. 1:11; 1Sa.
1:19.
Gen. 9:15-16, and Exo. 6:5, where God speaks of remembering His
covenant. So Psa. 105:8; Psa. 105:42* [Note: See the Structure of this
Psalm in A Key to the Psalms, by the same author and publisher.] ;
106:45: “He remembered for them His covenant,” though “they (verse
13) soon forgat His works,” and (verse 21) “they forgat God their
saviour.”

It denotes specially a remembrance for good. As in Psa. 25:6-7;
Psa. 78:39; Psa. 115:12; Psa. 119:49; Psa. 136:13. Isa. 43:25. Rev.
18:5.

Exo. 2:24.-“And God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with
Isaac, and with Jacob.” See this passage under the figures
Synonymia, Anaphora, Polysyndeton, and Metonymy (of the Cause).
1Sa. 1:11.-“If thou wilt ... remember me and not forget thine
handmaid.” See under Pleonasm.

1Sa. 1:19.-“And the Lord remembered her.” There is Hypocatastasis
here; for it is implied that He heard Hannah’s prayer (verse 9), and did
according to her request.

Psa. 78:39.-“Не remembered that they were but flesh.” This stands in
solemn contrast with verse 42: “They remembered not His hand.”

Psa. 103:14.-“He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are
dust.” This is the one thing that man will not do: he will not remember
our infirmities. Man will remember our sins; but these are the very
things that God will not remember (Isa. 43:25). Infinite in power, He
remembers our weakness. Perfect in holiness, He will not remember
our sins.

This remembrance, though in mercy to His people, involves the
punishment of their enemies.

See Psa. 137:7. Rev. 18:5.

Forgetting and Not Forgetting is also attributed to God.

Psa. 9:18 (19).-“For the needy shall not alway be forgotten.”
Psa. 13:1 (2).-“How long wilt thou forget me, O Jehovah.”
Psa. 42:9 (10).-“I will say unto God (El) my rock, Why hast thou
forgotten me?”
Isa. 49:15.-“Yet will | not forget thee.”
Jer. 23:39.-“I, even I, will utterly forget you, and | will forsake you”: i.e.,
the false prophets, who would say “the burden of the Lord.”
Hos. 4:6.-“I will also forget thy children.” (See under Metonymy of
Cause.)
Luk. 12:6.-“Not one of them is forgotten before God.”
When God says He will not forget His enemies, it means that their
punishment is certain, and will not be indefinitely deferred.
Job. 11:6.-“Know therefore that God causeth to be forgotten for thee
of thine iniquity.”
The A.V. [Note: The Authorized Version, or current Text of our
English Bible, 1611.] and Π.Ν. [Note: The Revised Version, 1881.]
both render this “God exacteth of thee /ess than thine iniquity
deserveth”: where two words have to be supplied through not seeing
the Figure, which denotes that “God (Eloah) causeth the punishment
of thine iniquity to be deferred.” The Heb. is: “He constantly lendeth to
thee”: i.e., crediteth thee like a lenient creditor.

Psa. 74:23.-“Forget not the voice of thine enemies”: {6., do not defer
their punishment.
Amo. 8:7.-‘I will never forget any of their works”: i.e., | will surely
remember them and punish them for them.

Thinking.
Gen. 50:20.-“Ye thought (i.e., devised) evil against me: but God
thought it for good.”
Psa. 40:5 (6).-“The thoughts which are to usward: they cannot be
reckoned up in order unto thee.”
Psa. 92:5 (6).-“O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are
very deep.”
Psa. 139:17.-“How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God”
(El).
Isa. 55:8.-These words may be presented according to their structure.
(See under Epanodos).
а — For my thoughts are not
b your thoughts, neither are
Ь your ways
а My ways, saith the Lord (Jehovah).
Jer. 29:11.-“I know the thoughts that | think toward you, saith Jehovah,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.” (See
this verse also under Metonymy of Adjunct and Hendiadys).
So Jer. 51:12; Jer. 4:28, etc.
Hissing.
Isa. 5:26.-“He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss
unto them from the end of the earth.” (See under Hypotyposis).
Isa. 7:18.-“Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost parts of
the rivers of Egypt,” etc.
Zec. 10:8.-‘I will hiss for them; and gather them, for | have redeemed
them.”

Breathing.
Gen. 2:7.-“The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.”* [Note: Or “living creature,” as in chap. 1:20, 21, 24, 30.]

Compare Eze. 21:31 (36), and Joh. 20:21.

Laughing.
Psa. 2:4.-“He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord
(Adonait [Note: Or “Jehovah,” according to another reading.] ) shall
have them in derision.”
Psa. 37:13.-“Adonait [Note: Or “Jehovah,” according to another
reading.] shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.” (See
under Metonymy of Adjunct).
Crying Out.
Isa. 42:13.-“He shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his
enemies.” And verse 14: “Now will | cry like a travailing woman.”

Compare Psa. 78:65.

Speaking, by way of discourse or command.

See Gen. 1:3; Gen. 2:16; Gen. 3:9; Gen. 6:13, to Noah. Gen. 12:1;
Gen. 13:14; Gen. 15:1-21; Gen. 16:1-16; Gen. 17:1-27; Gen. 18:1-33,
to Abraham. Exo. 3:4-5, etc., to Moses.

These instances occur so frequently that a great part of the Bible
would have to be transcribed if we gave them all.

Standing.
Gen. 18:22.-“But the Lord stood yet before Abraham.”

This was the primitive Text; but it is one of the eighteen passages
altered by the Sopherim to remove the harshness of the
Anthropopatheia. (See Appendix E).

3. Parts or Members of Certain Animals are attributed to God
A horn. 2Sa. 22:3. Psa. 18:2 (3). Messiah is so called. Luk. 1:69
(Hence it is used, by Metonymy, for strength and power. Psa. 75:10
(11); 112:9. Lam. 2:3)

Wings and Feathers are attributed to God. Psa. 91:4. Hence “the
shadow of his wings.” denotes His care. Psa. 17:8; Psa. 36:7 (8); 57:1;

2. Particulars
God is spoken of as Light. 1Jn. 1:5. It would require a volume to
investigate and carry out all that is taught by this wondrous Metaphor.
First, we should have to understand what Light itself is, and science
was never more baffled than to-day in defining it or explaining it. So is
God incomprehensible. A little while ago they thought they knew.
Professor Rxyntgen has now shown that they do not yet know.

Lights. Jam. 1:17. “The Father of lights”: i.e., the source, not only
of light itself, but of all light producers and light-bearers and light
givers: viz., the sun, moon, stars, planets, and all the fountains of light
contained in earthly substances producing electricity, gas, and light of
all kinds.

Psa. 27:1.-“The Lord is my light”: i.e., the source and origin of my life
and grace and salvation, etc., etc. Compare Num. 6:25. Psa. 36:9
(10); 43:3, etc.

3. Certain Elements are used as emblems of God
God is spoken of as a Fire. Deu. 4:24; Deu. 9:3; Deu. 32:27. Isa.
10:17. Hence the smoke of fire denotes His anger. Psa. 74:1; Psa.
80:4 (5) (margin). Deu. 29:20.
God is spoken of as a Lamp. 2Sa. 22:29. Psa. 18:28 (29). Hence
His word is so called. Psa. 119:105. Pro. 6:23. 2Pe. 1:19.

God is spoken of as Air or Wind, and breath is attributed to Him.
Job. 4:9. Psa. 18:15 (16). Isa. 30:33.

God is spoken of as Water. Jer. 2:13; Jer. 17:13. Psa. 36:8-9 (9,
10). Joh. 7:37-39. The gift of the Holy Spirit pertains to this figure. Isa.
44:3. Joe. 2:28-29 (3:1, 2). Zec. 12:10. Act. 2:17-18; Act. 2:33. Tit.
3:5-6. The blessings and merits of Christ are called the water of life.
Joh. 4:10; Joh. 4:14. Compare Isa. 55:1. Eze. 36:25. Zec. 14:8.

God is figured by things which pertain to the EARTH.

A Stone. Psa. 118:22. Mat. 21:42. Act. 4:11. 1Pe. 2:7.

A corner-stone, Eph. 2:20-21; and foundation and stumbling stone,
Isa. 8:14; Isa. 28:16. Zec. 3:9. Luk. 2:34. Rom. 9:32-33. 1Pe. 2:4; 1Pe.
2:6-8.

73:26 (margin). Isa. 26:4 (margin).

So Christ is thus spoken of Mat. 16:18. (See under Paregmenon
and Syllepsis).
So, in relation to the earth, God is spoken of as

A hiding-place, etc. Psa. 91:1; Psa. 119:114. Isa. 4:6.

A fortress. Psa. 31:2-3 (3, 4); 71:3; 91:2; 144:2. Zec. 2:5.

A tower of strength. Psa. 61:3 (4). Pro. 18:10. 2Sa. 22:51.
