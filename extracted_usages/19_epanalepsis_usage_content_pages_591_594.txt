a break or parenthesis: the repetition being a resumption of what the
writer or speaker had already before begun to say.

Rom. 3:25-26.-“Whom God hath set forth fo be а propitiation through
faith in his blood, to declare [his righteousness for the remission of
sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, / say],
at this time his righteousness:” etc.

1Co. 4:11; 1Co. 4:13, where the words in verse 11, “unto this
present hour,” are taken up again at the end of verse 13, “unto thid
day.”

1Co. 10:25; 1Co. 10:29.-Here, after a parenthesis (verses 26-28) the
word “conscience” is repeated from the end of verse 25, and the
argument is resumed in verse 29.

Eph. 3:1; Eph. 3:14.-“For this cause I, Paul, [the prisoner of Jesus
Christ.... (then after a parenthesis of thirteen verses he resumes in
verse 14), For this cause] | bow my knees,” etc.

Php. 1:22; Php. 1:24.-In verse 20, the apostle had been speaking of
glorifying God “by life, or by death.” For, if he lived, it would be
“Christ,” and if he died, it would be “gain” to him, and would release
him and give him rest from all his labours. The real conclusion is that if
he continued to abide in the flesh it would be better for them. But this
conclusion is interrupted by the mention, parenthetically, of a third
thing, which made him unable to say which of the two (living or dying)
he would really prefer, because this third thing was so much better
than either of the other two; for it was-the return of Christ. Then,
having mentioned this, he takes up the statement again, repeating the
beginning of verse 22 (“in the flesh”) and continuing it in verse 24.
Verse 23:-“But if | live in the flesh, [this is the fruit of my labour
(yet what | shall choose | wot not, for | am being pressed* [Note: —-
sé, | am being pressed.] out oft [Note: & occurs 857 times, and is
never translated “betwixt” anywhere else, But it 165 times rendered
“out of.”] these two, having a strong desire unto the return,$ [Note:
This is not the infinitive mood of the verb depart, but three distinct
words. οἱ (65), unto, 60 (to) the, ἀναλῦσαι (analusai), return. This verb
occurs in N.T. only in Luk. 12:36, “when he shall return from the
wedding.” It does mean, to depart, but from thence to here, not from
hence to there. See Tob. 2:1. Jdt. 13:1. 1Es. 3:3. Wisd. 2:1; 5:12. Sir.
3:15. 2Ma. 8:25; 2Ma. 9:1; 2Ma. 12:7; 2Ma. 15:28. Josephus Ant. vi.,
4, 1.] and to be with Christ, which is a far, far better thing): but to
remain in the flesh] is more needful for you” [i.e., than dying-not
better than Christ’s return].

He had told the Thessalonian saints that “we which are alive and
remain shall not precede those who are asleep. For the Lord Himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall first
rise. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
with them in clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and SO (οὕτω, houtdp,
thus, in this manner) shall we ever be with the Lord.” There, is
therefore, no other way of being with the Lord.” The Spirit of God
would not have written one thing to the Thessalonians and a different
thing to the Philippians.
Polysyndeton; or, Many-ands

The repetition of the word “and” at the beginning of successive

clauses
Pol’-y-syn’-de-ton. Greek, πολυσύδετον, from πολύς (polbis), many,
and συνδετόν (syndeton), bound together; hence, in grammar, it
means a conjunction (from σύν (syn) and δεῖν (dein), to bind). The
word, therefore, means much bound together or many conjunctions.

It is called also POLYSYNTHETON, from τίθηµ! (titheemi), to put
or place. Hence many puttings: i.e., of the same word-in this case of
the word “and.”

The English name for the Figure will, therefore, be MANY-ANDS.

Polysyndeton is merely one special form of Anaphora (q.v. [Note:
Which see.] ): i.e., it is a repetition of the same word at the beginning
of successive sentences: but this is always one special word “and.”
