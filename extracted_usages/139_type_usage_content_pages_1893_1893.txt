been given to it by Theologians is not exactly equivalent to any of
these usages: the nearest being Rom. 5:14, where Adam is spoken of
as a type of the Coming One.

The theological use of the word agrees more with what in the New
Testament is called σκιά (skia), a shadow (Heb. 10:1-39 i. Col. 2:17).

There is, therefore, not much profit in following out what have been
called types by men. Many are merely illustrations; and it would be
better so to call them; inasmuch as they did not and do not of
themselves teach the truths, but only illustrate those truths which are
elsewhere clearly revealed. We should never have called them types
but for such subsequent revelation; and therefore they are only
illustrations so far as their teaching agrees with clear revelation
afterward made.
